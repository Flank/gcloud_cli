     This command disables one or more previously-enabled services for consumption.

     To see a list of the enabled services for a project, run:

       $ {parent_command} list

     More information on listing services can be found at:

     To disable a service called `my-consumed-service` for the active
     project, run:

       $ {command} my-consumed-service

     To run the same command asynchronously (non-blocking), run:

       $ {command} my-consumed-service --async
