    brief: Get the IAM policy for a Google Compute Engine snapshot.
    DESCRIPTION: |
            *{command}* displays the IAM policy associated with a snapshot.
            If formatted as JSON, the output can be edited and used as
            a policy file for *set-iam-policy*. The output includes an "etag"
            field identifying the version emitted and allowing detection of
            concurrent policy updates; see
            $ {parent} set-iam-policy for additional details.
    EXAMPLES: |
            To print the IAM policy for a given snapshot, run:

              $ {command} my-snapshot
