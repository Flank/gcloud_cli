      Show metadata for a Managed Microsoft AD domain backup.

      Displays all metadata associated with a Active Directory domain backup given a

        * The active account does not have permission to access the given
          domain.

      The following command gets metadata for an AD domain backup with the name
      `my-backup` under the domain `my-domain` in project `my-project`.
