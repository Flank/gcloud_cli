      help_text: The job you want to show details for.
      spec: !REF googlecloudsdk.command_lib.scheduler.resources:job

    params:

        arg_name: view
        help_text: |
          The response_view specifies which subset of the Job will be returned.
          By default ListJobsRequest.response_view is Job.View.BASIC; not all
          information is retrieved by default because some data, such as
          payloads, might be desirable to return only when needed because of its
          large size or because of the sensitivity of data that it contains.
        default: basic
        choices:
          - arg_value: full
            enum_value: FULL
          - arg_value: basic
            enum_value: BASIC
