  """Create and manage Cloud Composer Environments.

  Cloud Composer is a managed Apache Airflow service that helps you create,
  schedule, monitor and manage workflows. Cloud Composer automation helps you
  create Airflow environments quickly and use Airflow-native tools, such as the
  powerful Airflow web interface and command line tools, so you can focus on
  your workflows and not your infrastructure.

  ## EXAMPLES

  To see how to create and manage environments, run:

      $ {command} environments --help

  To see how to manage long-running operations, run:

      $ {command} operations --help
