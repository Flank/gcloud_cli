  """Import a Cloud Product Search Catalog.

  This command imports a Cloud Product Search Catalog from a CSV file URI.

  URI should point to a CSV file in Google Cloud Storage bucket
  and start with: `gs://`

  The file itself must contain one ReferenceImage record per row with the
  following format:

  * catalog_name - The catalog ID to be created.
  * image_uri    - The Google Cloud Storage location of the image.
                   The URI must start with gs://.
  * product_id   - A user-defined ID for the product identified by
                  the reference image. A product ID can be associated with
                  multiple reference images. Restricted to 255 characters
                  including letters, numbers, underscore ( _ ) and hyphen (-).
  * product_category - String specifing the product category for the image.
  * bounding_poly    - A set of vertices defining the bounding polygon around
                      the area of interest in the image. Should be a list of an
                      even number of integers separated by commas
                      (e.g. "p1_x,p1_y,p2_x,p2_y,...,pn_x,pn_y") specifying,
                      the vertices in clockwise order. Defaults to full image
                      if empty.
