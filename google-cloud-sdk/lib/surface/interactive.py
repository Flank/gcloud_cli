  *{command}* provides an enhanced *bash*(1) command line with features that
  include:
  {features}

  ### Display

  The *{command}* display window is divided into sections, described here
  from top to bottom.

  *Previous Output*::

  Command output scrolls above the command input section as commands are
  executed.

  *Command Input*::

  Commands are typed, completed and edited in this section. The default prompt
  is "$ ". If a context has been set, then its tokens are prepopulated before
  the cursor.

  *Active Help*::

  As you type, this section displays in-line help summaries for commands, flags
  and arguments. You can toggle active help on and off via the *F2* key.

  *Status Display*::

  Current *gcloud* project and account information, and function key
  descriptions and settings are displayed in this section. Function keys
  toggle mode/state settings or run specific actions.
  {bindings}

  ### Auto and TAB Completion

  Command completions are displayed in a scrolling pop-up window. Use TAB and
  up/down keys to navigate the completions, and ENTER/RETURN to select the
  highlighted completion. Completions for _known_ commands, flags and static
  flag values are displayed automatically. Positional and dynamic flag value
  completions for _known_ commands are displayed after TAB is entered. TAB
  completion for unknown commands defers to *bash*(1), but using the
  *interactive* user interface. Absent specific command information, a
  file/path completer is used when TAB is entered for unknown positionals
  (arguments that do not start with '-').

  ### Control Characters

  Control characters affect the currently running command or the current
  command line being entered at the prompt.

  *^C*::
  If a command is currently running, then that command is interrupted. This
  terminates the command. Otherwise, if no command is running, ^C clears the
  current command line.

  *^D*::
  Exits when entered as the first character at the command prompt. You can
  also run the *exit* command at the prompt.

  *^W*::
  If a command is not currently running, then the last word on the command
  line is deleted. This is handy for "walking back" partial completions.

  ### Command history

  *{command}* maintains persistent command history across sessions.

  #### emacs mode

  *^N*:: Move ahead one line in the history.
  *^P*:: Move back one line in the history.
  *^R*:: Search backwards in the history.

  #### vi mode

  /:: Search backwards in the history.
  *j*:: Move ahead one line in the history.
  *k*:: Move back one line in the history.
  *n*:: Search backwards for the next match.
  *N*:: Search forwards for the next match.

  #### history search mode

  *ENTER/RETURN*:: Retrieve the matched command line from the history.
  *^R*:: Search backwards for the next match.
  *^S*:: Search forwards for the next match.

  ### Layout Configuration

  Parts of the layout are configurable via
  *$ gcloud config set* interactive/_property_. These properties are only
  checked at startup. You must exit and restart to see the effects of new
  settings.
  {properties}

  ### CLI Trees

  *{command}* uses CLI tree data files for typeahead, command line completion
  and help snippet generation. A few CLI trees are installed with their
  respective Cloud SDK components: *gcloud* (core component), *bq*, *gsutil*,
  and *kubectl*. See `$ gcloud topic cli-trees` for details.

  ## EXAMPLES

  Run *{command}* with the command context set to "gcloud ":

      {command} --context="gcloud "

  ## NOTES

  On Windows install *git*(1) for a *bash*(1) experience. *{command}* will
  then use the *git* (MinGW) *bash* instead of *cmd.exe*.
