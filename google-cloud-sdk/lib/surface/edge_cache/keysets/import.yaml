    brief: Import an EdgeCacheKeyset.
    description: |
      Import an EdgeCacheKeyset. If the named keyset already exists, it will be updated to
      match the imported resource configuration.

      Note: If you are updating an existing keyset, you should ensure that it includes
      any public keys still needed to validate incoming user requests.

      If the named keyset does not already exist, a new keyset will be created
      with that name.

    examples: |
      To import an EdgeCacheKeyset from a YAML file, run:

        $ {command} my-keyset --source=my-keyset.yaml
