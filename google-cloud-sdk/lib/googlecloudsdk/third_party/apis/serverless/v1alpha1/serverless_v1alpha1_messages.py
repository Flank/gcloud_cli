    deletionTimestamp: DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which
      this resource will be deleted. This field is set by the server when a
      graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not directly settable
      by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible
      from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this
      field, once the finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list
      contains items, deletion is blocked. Once the deletionTimestamp is set,
      this value may not be unset or be set further into the future, although
      it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time.
      For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The
      Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination signal to the
      containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a
      hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup,
      remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this
      object may still exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or
