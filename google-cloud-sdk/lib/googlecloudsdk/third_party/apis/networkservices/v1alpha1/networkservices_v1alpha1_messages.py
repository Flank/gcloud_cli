  Enums:
    CacheModeValueValuesEnum: Optional. Cache modes allow users to control the
      behaviour of the cache, what content it should cache automatically,
      whether to respect origin headers, or whether to unconditionally cache
      all responses. For all cache modes, Cache-Control headers will be passed
      to the client. Use clientTtl to override what is sent to the client.
    SignedRequestModeValueValuesEnum: Optional. Whether to enforce signed
      requests. The default value is DISABLED, which means all content is
      public, and does not authorize access. You must also set a
      signedRequestKeyset to enable signed requests. When set to
      REQUIRE_SIGNATURES, all matching requests will have their signature
      validated. Requests that were not signed with the corresponding private
      key, or that are otherwise invalid (expired, do not match the signature,
      IP address, or header) will be rejected with a HTTP 403 and (if enabled)
      logged.

  Messages:
    NegativeCachingPolicyValue: Optional. Sets a cache TTL for the specified
      HTTP status code. negativeCaching must be enabled to configure
      negativeCachingPolicy. - Omitting the policy and leaving negativeCaching
      enabled will use the default TTLs for each status code, defined in
      negativeCaching. - TTLs must be >= 0 (where 0 is "always revalidate")
      and <= 86400s (1 day) Note that when specifying an explicit
      negativeCachingPolicy, you should take care to specify a cache TTL for
      all response codes that you wish to cache. The CDNPolicy will not apply
      any default negative caching when a policy exists.

  Fields:
    cacheKeyPolicy: Optional. Defines the request parameters that contribute
      to the cache key.
    cacheMode: Optional. Cache modes allow users to control the behaviour of
      the cache, what content it should cache automatically, whether to
      respect origin headers, or whether to unconditionally cache all
      responses. For all cache modes, Cache-Control headers will be passed to
      the client. Use clientTtl to override what is sent to the client.
    clientTtl: Optional. Specifies a separate client (e.g. browser client)
      TTL, separate from the TTL used by the edge caches. Leaving this empty
      will use the same cache TTL for both the CDN and the client-facing
      response. - The TTL must be > 0 and <= 86400s (1 day) - The clientTtl
      cannot be larger than the defaultTtl (if set) - Fractions of a second
      are not allowed. Omit this field to use the defaultTtl, or the max-age
      set by the origin, as the client-facing TTL. When the cache mode is set
      to "USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS" or "BYPASS_CACHE", you must omit this field.
    defaultTtl: Optional. Specifies the default TTL for cached content served
      by this origin for responses that do not have an existing valid TTL
      (max-age or s-max-age). Defaults to 3600s (1 hour). - The TTL must be >=
      0 and <= 2592000s (1 month) - Setting a TTL of "0" means "always
      revalidate" (equivalent to must-revalidate) - The value of defaultTTL
      cannot be set to a value greater than that of maxTTL. - Fractions of a
      second are not allowed. - When the cacheMode is set to FORCE_CACHE_ALL,
      the defaultTTL will overwrite the TTL set in all responses. Note that
      infrequently accessed objects may be evicted from the cache before the
      defined TTL. Objects that expire will be revalidated with the origin.
      When the cache mode is set to "USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS" or "BYPASS_CACHE",
      you must omit this field.
    maxTtl: Optional. Specifies the maximum allowed TTL for cached content
      served by this origin. Defaults to 86400s (1 day). Cache directives that
      attempt to set a max-age or s-maxage higher than this, or an Expires
      header more than maxTtl seconds in the future will be capped at the
      value of maxTTL, as if it were the value of an s-maxage Cache-Control
      directive. - The TTL must be >= 0 and <= 2592000s (1 month) - Setting a
      TTL of "0" means "always revalidate" - The value of maxTtl must be equal
      to or greater than defaultTtl. - Fractions of a second are not allowed.
      When the cache mode is set to "USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS", "FORCE_CACHE_ALL",
      or "BYPASS_CACHE", you must omit this field.
    negativeCaching: Optional. Negative caching allows per-status code TTLs to
      be set, in order to apply fine-grained caching for common errors or
      redirects. This can reduce the load on your origin and improve end-user
      experience by reducing response latency. By default, the CDNPolicy will
      apply the following default TTLs to these status codes: - HTTP 300
      (Multiple Choice), 301, 308 (Permanent Redirects): 10m - HTTP 404 (Not
      Found), 410 (Gone), 451 (Unavailable For Legal Reasons): 120s - HTTP 405
      (Method Not Found), 414 (URI Too Long), 501 (Not Implemented): 60s These
      defaults can be overridden in negativeCachingPolicy
    negativeCachingPolicy: Optional. Sets a cache TTL for the specified HTTP
      status code. negativeCaching must be enabled to configure
      negativeCachingPolicy. - Omitting the policy and leaving negativeCaching
      enabled will use the default TTLs for each status code, defined in
      negativeCaching. - TTLs must be >= 0 (where 0 is "always revalidate")
      and <= 86400s (1 day) Note that when specifying an explicit
      negativeCachingPolicy, you should take care to specify a cache TTL for
      all response codes that you wish to cache. The CDNPolicy will not apply
      any default negative caching when a policy exists.
    signedRequestKeyset: Optional. The EdgeCacheKeyset containing the set of
      public keys used to validate signed requests at the edge. For example,
      the following are both valid URLs to an EdgeCacheKeyset resource: - netw
      orkservices/v1alpha1/projects/project/global/edgeCacheKeysets/yourKeyset
      - /global/edgeCacheKeysets/yourKeyset signedRequestMode must be set to a
      value other than DISABLED when a keyset is provided.
    signedRequestMode: Optional. Whether to enforce signed requests. The
      default value is DISABLED, which means all content is public, and does
      not authorize access. You must also set a signedRequestKeyset to enable
      signed requests. When set to REQUIRE_SIGNATURES, all matching requests
      will have their signature validated. Requests that were not signed with
      the corresponding private key, or that are otherwise invalid (expired,
      do not match the signature, IP address, or header) will be rejected with
      a HTTP 403 and (if enabled) logged.

    failoverOrigin: Optional. The Origin resource to try when the current
      origin cannot be reached. After maxAttempts is reached, the configured
      failoverOrigin will be used to fulfil the request. For example, the
      following are both valid URLs to an EdgeCacheOrigin resource: - networks
      ervices/v1alpha1/projects/project/global/edgeCacheOrigins/yourOrigin -
      /global/edgeCacheOrigins/yourOrigin The value of
      timeout.maxAttemptsTimeout dictates the timeout across all origins.
    labels: Optional. Set of label tags associated with the EdgeCache
      resource.
    maxAttempts: Optional. The maximum number of attempts to cache fill from
      this origin. Another attempt is made when a cache fill fails with one of
      the retry_conditions. Once max_attempts to this origin have failed the
      failover_origin will be used, if one is specified. That failover_origin
      may specify its own max_attempts, retry_conditions and failover_origin
      to control its own cache fill failures. The total number of allowed
      attempts to cache fill across this and failover origins is limited to
      four. The total time allowed for cache fill attempts across this and
      failover origins can be controlled with max_attempts_timeout. The last
      valid response from an origin will be returned to the client. If no
      origin returns a valid response, an HTTP 503 will be returned to the
      client. Defaults to 1. Must be a value greater than 0 and less than 4.
    name: Required. Name of the resource; provided by the client when the
      resource is created. The name must be 1-64 characters long, and match
      the regular expression a-zA-Z* which means the first character must be a
      letter, and all following characters must be a dash, underscore, letter
      or digit.
    originAddress: Required. A fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or IP
      address reachable over the public Internet, or the address of a Google
      Cloud Storage bucket. This address will be used as the origin for cache
      requests - e.g. FQDN: media-backend.example.com IPv4:35.218.1.1
      IPv6:[2607:f8b0:4012:809::200e] Cloud Storage: gs://bucketname When
      providing an FQDN (hostname), it must be publicly resolvable (e.g. via
      Google public DNS) and IP addresses must be publicly routable. If a
      Cloud Storage bucket is provided, it must be in the canonical
      "gs://bucketname" format. Other forms, such as "storage.googleapis.com",
      will be rejected.
    port: Optional. The port to connect to the origin on. Defaults to port 443
      for HTTP2 and HTTPS protocols, and port 80 for HTTP.
    protocol: Optional. The protocol to use to connect to the configured
      origin. Defaults to HTTP2, and it is strongly recommended that users use
      HTTP2 for both security & performance. When using HTTP2 or HTTPS as the
      protocol, a valid, publicly-signed, unexpired TLS (SSL) certificate must
      be presented by the origin server.
    retryConditions: Optional. Specifies one or more retry conditions for the
      configured origin. If the failure mode during a connection attempt to
      the origin matches the configured retryCondition(s), the origin request
      will be retried up to maxAttempts times. The failoverOrigin, if
      configured, will then be used to satisfy the request. The default
      retryCondition is "CONNECT_FAILURE". retryConditions apply to this
      origin, and not subsequent failoverOrigin(s), which may specify their
      own retryConditions and maxAttempts. Valid values are: -
      CONNECT_FAILURE: Retry on failures connecting to origins, for example
      due to connection timeouts. - HTTP_5XX: Retry if the origin responds
      with any 5xx response code, or if the origin does not respond at all,
      example: disconnects, reset, read timeout, connection failure, and
      refused streams. - GATEWAY_ERROR: Similar to 5xx, but only applies to
      response codes 502, 503 or 504. - RETRIABLE_4XX: Retry for retriable 4xx
      response codes, which include HTTP 409 (Conflict) and HTTP 429 (Too Many
      Requests) - NOT_FOUND: Retry if the origin returns a HTTP 404 (Not
      Found). This can be useful when generating video content, and the
      segment is not available yet.
    timeout: Optional. The connection and HTTP timeout configuration for this
      origin.
    updateTime: Output only. Update timestamp in RFC3339 text format.

  r"""An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
  controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
  `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`.
  Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains
  (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can
  be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of
  Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is
  a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression
  evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of
  the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support
  conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
  policies). **JSON example:** { "bindings": [ { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
  "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com",
  "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role":

  version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  Fields:
    auditConfigs: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.
    bindings: Associates a list of `members` to a `role`. Optionally, may
      specify a `condition` that determines how and when the `bindings` are
      applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one member.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support
      conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM

    headerAction: Optional. The header actions, including adding & removing
      headers, for requests that match this route.
    matchRules: Required. The list of criteria for matching attributes of a
      request to this routeRule. This list has OR semantics: the request
      matches this routeRule when any of the matchRules are satisfied. However
      predicates within a given matchRule have AND semantics. All predicates
      within a matchRule must match for the request to match the rule.
    origin: Optional. The Origin resource that requests to this route should
      fetch from when a matching response is not in cache. Origins can be
      defined as short names ("my-origin") or fully-qualified resource URLs -
      e.g. "networkservices.googleapis.com/projects/my-
      project/global/edgecacheorigins/my-origin" Only one of origin or
      urlRedirect can be set.
    priority: Required. The priority of this route rule, where 1 is the
      highest priority. You cannot configure two or more routeRules with the
      same priority. Priority for each rule must be set to a number between 1
      and 999 inclusive. Priority numbers can have gaps, which enable you to
      add or remove rules in the future without affecting the rest of the
      rules. For example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 12, 16 is a valid series of
      priority numbers to which you could add rules numbered from 6 to 8, 10
      to 11, and 13 to 15 in the future without any impact on existing rules.
    routeAction: Optional. In response to a matching path, the routeAction
      performs advanced routing actions like URL rewrites, header
      transformations, etc. prior to forwarding the request to the selected
      origin.
    urlRedirect: Optional. The URL redirect configuration for requests that
      match this route. Only one of origin or urlRedirect can be set.
