  Currently, we set _quota_project on the credentials, unlike for http requests,
  which add quota project through request wrapping to implement
  go/gcloud-quota-model-v2.

  Additionally, we wrap the refresh method and plug in our own
  google.auth.transport.Request object that uses our transport.

  Args:
    enable_resource_quota: bool, By default, we are going to tell APIs to use
        the quota of the project being operated on. For some APIs we want to use
        gcloud's quota, so you can explicitly disable that behavior by passing
        False here.
    force_resource_quota: bool, If true resource project quota will be used by
        this client regardless of the settings in gcloud. This should be used
        for newer APIs that cannot work with legacy project quota.
    allow_account_impersonation: bool, True to allow use of impersonated service
        account credentials for calls made with this client. If False, the
        active user credentials will always be used.
