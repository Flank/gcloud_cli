    type: string
  failoverOrigin:
    description: |-
      The EdgeCacheOrigin resource to try when the current origin cannot be
      reached. After maxAttempts is reached, the configured failoverOrigin will
      be used to fulfil the request. The following are both valid paths to an
      EdgeCacheOrigin resource: * projects/my-
      project/locations/global/edgeCacheOrigins/my-origin * my- origin The value
      of timeout.maxAttemptsTimeout dictates the timeout across all origins.
    type: string
  labels:
    description: Set of label tags associated with the EdgeCache resource.
    $ref: LabelsValue.yaml
  maxAttempts:
    description: |-
      The maximum number of attempts to cache fill from this origin. Another
      attempt is made when a cache fill fails with one of the retry_conditions.
      Once max_attempts to this origin have failed the failover_origin will be
      used, if one is specified. That failover_origin may specify its own
      max_attempts, retry_conditions and failover_origin to control its own
      cache fill failures. The total number of allowed attempts to cache fill
      across this and failover origins is limited to four. The total time
      allowed for cache fill attempts across this and failover origins can be
      controlled with max_attempts_timeout. The last valid, non-retried response
      from all origins will be returned to the client. If no origin returns a
      valid response, an HTTP 502 will be returned to the client. Defaults to 1.
      Must be a value greater than 0 and less than 4.
    type: integer
  name:
    description: |-
      Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is created.
      The name must be 1-64 characters long, and match the regular expression
      a-zA-Z* which means the first character must be a letter, and all
      following characters must be a dash, underscore, letter or digit.
    type: string
  originAddress:
    description: |-
      A fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or IP address reachable over the
      public Internet, or the address of a Google Cloud Storage bucket. This
      address will be used as the origin for cache requests. For example: -
      FQDN: media-backend.example.com - IPv4: 35.218.1.1 - IPv6:
      2607:f8b0:4012:809::200e - Google Cloud Storage: gs://bucketname or
      bucketname.storage.googleapis.com When providing an FQDN (hostname), it
      must be publicly resolvable (e.g. via Google public DNS). It must not
      contain a protocol (e.g. https://) and it must not contain any slashes.
      When providing an IP address, it must be publicly routable. IPv6 addresses
      should not be enclosed in square brackets.
    type: string
  port:
    description: |-
      The port to connect to the origin on. Defaults to port 443 for HTTP2 and
      HTTPS protocols, and port 80 for HTTP.
    type: integer
  protocol:
    description: |-
      The protocol to use to connect to the configured origin. Defaults to
      HTTP2, and it is strongly recommended that users use HTTP2 for both
      security & performance. When using HTTP2 or HTTPS as the protocol, a
      valid, publicly-signed, unexpired TLS (SSL) certificate must be presented
      by the origin server.
    type: string
    enum:
    - HTTP
    - HTTP2
    - HTTPS
    - PROTOCOL_UNSPECIFIED
  retryConditions:
    description: |-
      Specifies one or more retry conditions for the configured origin. If the
      failure mode during a connection attempt to the origin matches the
      configured retryCondition(s), the origin request will be retried up to
      maxAttempts times. The failoverOrigin, if configured, will then be used to
      satisfy the request. The default retryCondition is "CONNECT_FAILURE".
      retryConditions apply to this origin, and not subsequent
      failoverOrigin(s), which may specify their own retryConditions and
      maxAttempts. Valid values are: -
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
      enum:
      - CONNECT_FAILURE
      - FORBIDDEN
      - GATEWAY_ERROR
      - HTTP_5XX
      - NOT_FOUND
      - RETRIABLE_4XX
      - RETRY_CONDITIONS_UNSPECIFIED
  timeout:
    description: |-
      The connection and HTTP timeout configuration for this origin.
    $ref: Timeout.yaml
