      An ordered list of Ed25519 public keys to use for validating signed
      requests. You must specify at least one (1) key, and may have up to three
      (3) keys. Ed25519 public keys are not secret, and only allow Google to
      validate a request was signed by your corresponding private key. You
      should ensure that the private key is kept secret, and that only
      authorized users can add public keys to a keyset. You can rotate keys by
      appending (pushing) a new key to the list of public keys, and removing any
      superseded keys.
