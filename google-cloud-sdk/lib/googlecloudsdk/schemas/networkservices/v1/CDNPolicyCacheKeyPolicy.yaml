  excludeHost:
    description: |-
      If true, requests to different hosts will be cached separately. Note: this
      should only be enabled if hosts share the same origin and content Removing
      the host from the cache key may inadvertently result in different objects
      being cached than intended, depending on which route the first user
      matched.
    type: boolean
  excludeQueryString:
    description: |-
      If true, exclude query string parameters from the cache key. If false (the
      default), include the query string parameters in the cache key according
      to includeQueryParameters and excludeQueryParameters. If neither
      includeQueryParameters nor excludeQueryParameters is set, the entire query
      string will be included.
    type: boolean
  excludedQueryParameters:
    description: |-
      Names of query string parameters to exclude from cache keys. All other
      parameters will be included. Either specify includedQueryParameters or
      excludedQueryParameters, not both. '&' and '=' will be percent encoded and
      not treated as delimiters. You may exclude up to 10 query parameters. Each
      query parameter name must be between 1 and 32 characters long (inclusive).

  includedCookieNames:
    description: |-
      Names of Cookies to include in cache keys. The cookie name and cookie
      value of each cookie named will be used as part of the cache key.
      Cookie names: - must be valid RFC 6265 "cookie- name" tokens - are
      case sensitive - cannot start with "Edge-Cache-" (case insensitive)
      Note that specifying several cookies, and/or cookies that have a large
      range of values (e.g., per-user) will dramatically impact the cache
      hit rate, and may result in a higher eviction rate and reduced
      performance. You may specify up to three cookie names.

      type: string
  includedHeaderNames:
    description: |-
      Names of HTTP request headers to include in cache keys. The value
      of the header field will be used as part of the cache key. -
      Header names must be valid HTTP RFC 7230 header field values. -
      Header field names are case insensitive - You may specify up to
      five header names. - To include the HTTP method, use ":method"
      Refer to the documentation for the allowed list of header names.
      Note that specifying several headers, and/or headers that have a
      large range of values (e.g. per-user) will dramatically impact the
      cache hit rate, and may result in a higher eviction rate and
      reduced performance. You may specify up to 5 header names.
