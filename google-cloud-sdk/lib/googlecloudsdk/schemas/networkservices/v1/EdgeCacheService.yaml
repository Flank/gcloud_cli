  disableHttp2:
    description: |-
      Disables HTTP/2. HTTP/2 (h2) is enabled by default and recommended for
      performance. HTTP/2 improves connection re-use and reduces connection
      setup overhead by sending multiple streams over the same connection. Some
      legacy HTTP clients may have issues with HTTP/2 connections due to broken
      HTTP/2 implementations. Setting this to `true` prevents HTTP/2 from being
      advertised and negotiated.

    description: HTTP/3 (IETF QUIC) and Google QUIC are enabled by default.

    description: |-
      Certificate resources that are used to authenticate connections between
      users and the EdgeCacheService. Note that only global certificates with a
      scope of `EDGE_CACHE` can be attached to an EdgeCacheService. The
      following are both valid paths to an `edge_ssl_certificates` resource: *
      `projects/project/locations/global/certificates/media-example-com-cert` *
      `media-example-com-cert` You may specify up to 5 SSL certificates.

  requireTls:
    description: |-
      Require TLS (HTTPS) for all clients connecting to this service.
      Clients who connect over HTTP (port 80) receive an HTTP 301 response
      to the same URL over HTTPS (port 443). You must have at least one
      edge_ssl_certificates specified to enable this.
