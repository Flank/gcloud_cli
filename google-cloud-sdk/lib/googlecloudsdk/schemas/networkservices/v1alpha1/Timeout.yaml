  responseTimeout:
    description: |-
      The maximum duration to wait for the last byte of a response to arrive
      when reading from the HTTP connection/stream. Defaults to 30 seconds. The
      timeout must be a value between 1s and 120s. The responseTimeout starts
      after the connection has been established. This also applies to HTTP
      Chunked Transfer Encoding responses, and/or when an open-ended Range
      request is made to the origin. Origins that take longer to write
      additional bytes to the response than the configured responseTimeout will
      result in an error being returned to the client. If the response headers
      have already been written to the connection, the response will be
      truncated and logged.
