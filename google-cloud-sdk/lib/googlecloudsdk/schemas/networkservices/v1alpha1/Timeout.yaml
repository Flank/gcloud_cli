  connectTimeout:
    description: |-
      The maximum duration to wait for the origin connection to be established,
      including DNS lookup, TLS handshake and TCP/QUIC connection establishment.
      Defaults to 5 seconds. The timeout must be a value between 1s and 15s.
    type: string
  maxAttemptsTimeout:
    description: |-
      The maximum time across all connection attempts to the origin, including
      failover origins, before returning an error to the client. A HTTP 503 will
      be returned if the timeout is reached before a response is returned.
      Defaults to 5 seconds. The timeout must be a value between 1s and 15s. If
      a failoverOrigin is specified, the maxAttemptsTimeout of the first
      configured origin takes precedence and determines the timeout for all
      requests.
    type: string
  responseTimeout:
    description: |-
      The maximum duration to wait for data to arrive when reading from the HTTP
      connection/stream. Defaults to 5 seconds. The timeout must be a value
      between 1s and 30s. This also applies to HTTP Chunked Transfer Encoding
      responses, and/or when an open-ended Range request is made to the origin.
      Origins that take longer to write additional bytes to the response than
      the configured responseTimeout will result in an error being returned to
      the client. If the response headers have already been written to the
      connection, the response will be truncated and logged.
