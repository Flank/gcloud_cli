  headerAction:
    description: |-
      The header actions, including adding & removing headers, for requests that
      match this route.
    $ref: HeaderAction.yaml
  matchRules:
    description: |-
      The list of criteria for matching attributes of a request to this
      routeRule. This list has OR semantics: the request matches this routeRule
      when any of the matchRules are satisfied. However predicates within a
      given matchRule have AND semantics. All predicates within a matchRule must
      match for the request to match the rule. You may specify up to 5 match
      rules.
    type: array

      $ref: MatchRule.yaml
  origin:
    description: |-
      The EdgeCacheOrigin resource that requests to this route should fetch
      from when a matching response is not in cache. The following are both
      valid paths to an EdgeCacheOrigin resource: * projects/my-
      project/locations/global/edgeCacheOrigins/my-origin * my- origin Only
      one of origin or urlRedirect can be set.
    type: string
  priority:
    description: |-
      The priority of this route rule, where 1 is the highest priority. You
      cannot configure two or more routeRules with the same priority.
      Priority for each rule must be set to a number between 1 and 999
      inclusive. Priority numbers can have gaps, which enable you to add or
      remove rules in the future without affecting the rest of the rules.
      For example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 12, 16 is a valid series of priority
      numbers to which you could add rules numbered from 6 to 8, 10 to 11,
      and 13 to 15 in the future without any impact on existing rules.
    type: integer
  routeAction:
    description: |-
      In response to a matching path, the routeAction performs advanced
      routing actions like URL rewrites, header transformations, etc. prior
      to forwarding the request to the selected origin.
    $ref: RouteAction.yaml
  urlRedirect:
    description: |-
      The URL redirect configuration for requests that match this route.
      Only one of origin or urlRedirect can be set.
    $ref: UrlRedirect.yaml
