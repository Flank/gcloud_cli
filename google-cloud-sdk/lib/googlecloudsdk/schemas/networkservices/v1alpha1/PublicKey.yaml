      The ID of the public key. The ID must be 1-63 characters long, and comply
      with RFC1035. Specifically, the ID must be 1-63 characters long and match
      the regular expression [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])? which means the first
      character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be
      a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which
      cannot be a dash.
