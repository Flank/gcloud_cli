  faultInjectionPolicy:
    description: |-
      The specification for fault injection introduced into traffic to test
      the resiliency of clients to destination service failure. As part of
      fault injection, when clients send requests to a destination, delays
      can be introduced on a percentage of requests before sending those
      requests to the destination service. Similarly requests from clients
      can be aborted by for a percentage of requests. timeout and
      retry_policy will be ignored by clients that are configured with a
      fault_injection_policy
    $ref: GrpcRouteFaultInjectionPolicy.yaml
  requestHeaderModifier:
    description: |-
      The specification for modifying the headers of a matching request
      prior to delivery of the request to the destination. Cannot be set if
      the route is attached to a Router whose type is PROXYLESS_GRPC.
    $ref: GrpcRouteHeaderModifier.yaml
  requestMirrorPolicy:
    description: |-
      Specifies the policy on how requests intended for the route's
      destination are mirrored to a separate mirrored destination. The proxy
      will not wait for the mirrored destination to respond before returning
      the response. Prior to sending traffic to the mirrored service, the
      host / authority header is suffixed with -shadow. Cannot be set if the
      route is attached to a Router whose type is PROXYLESS_GRPC.
    $ref: GrpcRouteRequestMirrorPolicy.yaml
  responseHeaderModifier:
    description: |-
      The specification for modifying the headers of a response prior to
      sending the response back to the client. Cannot be set if the route is
      attached to a Router whose type is PROXYLESS_GRPC.
    $ref: GrpcRouteHeaderModifier.yaml
  retryPolicy:
    description: Specifies the retry policy associated with this route.
    $ref: GrpcRouteRetryPolicy.yaml
  timeout:
    description: |-
      Specifies the timeout for selected route. Timeout is computed from the
      time the request has been fully processed (i.e. end of stream) up
      until the response has been completely processed. Timeout includes all
      retries.
    type: string
  urlRewrite:
    description: |-
      The specification for rewrite URL before forwarding requests to the
      destination. Cannot be set if the route is attached to a Router whose
      type is PROXYLESS_GRPC.
    $ref: GrpcRouteURLRewrite.yaml
