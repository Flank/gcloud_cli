    type: string
  scope:
    description: |-
      Scope defines a logical configuration boundary for mesh. The routes
      pointing to this particular mesh resource defines the mesh configuration
      and the scope field name is used by mesh clients to receive that
      configuration. There cannot be more than one Mesh resource instance of the
      same type (SIDECAR or PROXYLESS_GRPC) with the same scope.

  interception_port:
    description: |-
      If set to a valid TCP port (1-65535), instructs the SIDECAR proxy to listen
      on the specified port of localhost (127.0.0.1) address. The SIDECAR proxy
      will expect all traffic to be redirected to this port regardless of its
      actual ip:port destination. If unset, a port '15001' is used as the
      interception port. This field is only valid if the type of Mesh is SIDECAR.
