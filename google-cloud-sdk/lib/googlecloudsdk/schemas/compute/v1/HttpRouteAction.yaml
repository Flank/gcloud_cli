  corsPolicy:
    description: |-
      The specification for allowing client side cross-origin requests. Please
      see W3C Recommendation for Cross Origin Resource Sharing  Not supported
      when the URL map is bound to target gRPC proxy.
    $ref: CorsPolicy.yaml
  faultInjectionPolicy:
    description: |-
      The specification for fault injection introduced into traffic to test the
      resiliency of clients to backend service failure. As part of fault
      injection, when clients send requests to a backend service, delays can be
      introduced by Loadbalancer on a percentage of requests before sending
      those request to the backend service. Similarly requests from clients can
      be aborted by the Loadbalancer for a percentage of requests. timeout and
      retry_policy will be ignored by clients that are configured with a
      fault_injection_policy. Not supported when the URL map is bound to target
      gRPC proxy that has validateForProxyless field set to true.
    $ref: HttpFaultInjection.yaml
  maxStreamDuration:
    description: |-
      Specifies the maximum duration (timeout) for streams on the selected
      route. Unlike the timeout field where the timeout duration starts from the
      time the request has been fully processed (i.e. end-of- stream), the
      duration in this field is computed from the beginning of the stream until
      the response has been completely processed, including all retries. A
      stream that does not complete in this duration is closed. If not
      specified, will use the largest maxStreamDuration among all backend
      services associated with the route. This field is only allowed if the Url
      map is used with backend services with loadBalancingScheme set to
      INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
    $ref: Duration.yaml
  requestMirrorPolicy:
    description: |-
      Specifies the policy on how requests intended for the route's backends are
      shadowed to a separate mirrored backend service. Loadbalancer does not
      wait for responses from the shadow service. Prior to sending traffic to
      the shadow service, the host / authority header is suffixed with -shadow.
      Not supported when the URL map is bound to target gRPC proxy that has
      validateForProxyless field set to true.
    $ref: RequestMirrorPolicy.yaml
  retryPolicy:
    description: |-
      Specifies the retry policy associated with this route. Not supported when
      the URL map is bound to target gRPC proxy that has validateForProxyless
      field set to true.
    $ref: HttpRetryPolicy.yaml
  timeout:
    description: |-
      Specifies the timeout for the selected route. Timeout is computed from the
      time the request has been fully processed (i.e. end-of-stream) up until
      the response has been completely processed. Timeout includes all retries.
      If not specified, will use the largest timeout among all backend services
      associated with the route. Not supported when the URL map is bound to
      target gRPC proxy that has validateForProxyless field set to true.
    $ref: Duration.yaml
  urlRewrite:
    description: |-
      The spec to modify the URL of the request, prior to forwarding the request
      to the matched service. urlRewrite is the only action supported in UrlMaps
      for external HTTP(S) load balancers. Not supported when the URL map is
      bound to target gRPC proxy that has validateForProxyless field set to
      true.
    $ref: UrlRewrite.yaml
  weightedBackendServices:
    description: |-
      A list of weighted backend services to send traffic to when a route match
      occurs. The weights determine the fraction of traffic that flows to their
      corresponding backend service. If all traffic needs to go to a single
      backend service, there must be one weightedBackendService with weight set
      to a non-zero number. Once a backendService is identified and before
      forwarding the request to the backend service, advanced routing actions
      such as URL rewrites and header transformations are applied depending on
      additional settings specified in this HttpRouteAction.
