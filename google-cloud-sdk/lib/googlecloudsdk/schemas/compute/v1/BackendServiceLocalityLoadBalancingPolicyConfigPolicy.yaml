      The name of a locality load balancer policy to be used. The value should
      be one of the predefined ones as supported by localityLbPolicy, although
      at the moment only ROUND_ROBIN is supported. This field should only be
      populated when the customPolicy field is not used. Note that specifying
      the same policy more than once for a backend is not a valid configuration
      and will be rejected.
