  balancingMode:
    description: |-
      Specifies the balancing mode for this backend. For global HTTP(S) or
      TCP/SSL load balancing, the default is UTILIZATION. Valid values are
      UTILIZATION, RATE (for HTTP(S)) and CONNECTION (for TCP/SSL). For Internal
      Load Balancing, the default and only supported mode is CONNECTION.
    type: string
    enum:
    - CONNECTION
    - RATE
    - UTILIZATION
  capacityScaler:
    description: |-
      A multiplier applied to the group's maximum servicing capacity (based on
      UTILIZATION, RATE or CONNECTION). Default value is 1, which means the
      group will serve up to 100% of its configured capacity (depending on
      balancingMode). A setting of 0 means the group is completely drained,
      offering 0% of its available Capacity. Valid range is [0.0,1.0].  This
      cannot be used for internal load balancing.
    type: number
  description:
    description: |-
      An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you
      create the resource.
    type: string
  failover:
    description: |-
      This field designates whether this is a failover backend. More than one
      failover backend can be configured for a given BackendService.
    type: boolean
  group:
    description: |-
      The fully-qualified URL of an Instance Group or Network Endpoint Group
      resource. In case of instance group this defines the list of instances
      that serve traffic. Member virtual machine instances from each instance
      group must live in the same zone as the instance group itself. No two
      backends in a backend service are allowed to use same Instance Group
      resource.  For Network Endpoint Groups this defines list of endpoints. All
      endpoints of Network Endpoint Group must be hosted on instances located in
      the same zone as the Network Endpoint Group. Backend service can not
      contain mix of Instance Group and Network Endpoint Group backends.  Note
      that you must specify an Instance Group or Network Endpoint Group resource
      using the fully-qualified URL, rather than a partial URL.  When the
      BackendService has load balancing scheme INTERNAL, the instance group must
      be within the same region as the BackendService. Network Endpoint Groups
      are not supported for INTERNAL load balancing scheme.
    type: string
  maxConnections:
    description: |-
      The max number of simultaneous connections for the group. Can be used with
      either CONNECTION or UTILIZATION balancing modes. For CONNECTION mode,
      either maxConnections or maxConnectionsPerInstance must be set.  This
      cannot be used for internal load balancing.
    type: integer
  maxConnectionsPerEndpoint:
    description: |-
      The max number of simultaneous connections that a single backend network
      endpoint can handle. This is used to calculate the capacity of the group.
      Can be used in either CONNECTION or UTILIZATION balancing modes. For
      CONNECTION mode, either maxConnections or maxConnectionsPerEndpoint must
      be set.  This cannot be used for internal load balancing.
    type: integer
  maxConnectionsPerInstance:
    description: |-
      The max number of simultaneous connections that a single backend instance
      can handle. This is used to calculate the capacity of the group. Can be
      used in either CONNECTION or UTILIZATION balancing modes. For CONNECTION
      mode, either maxConnections or maxConnectionsPerInstance must be set.
      This cannot be used for internal load balancing.
    type: integer
  maxRate:
    description: |-
      The max requests per second (RPS) of the group. Can be used with either
      RATE or UTILIZATION balancing modes, but required if RATE mode. For RATE
      mode, either maxRate or maxRatePerInstance must be set.  This cannot be
      used for internal load balancing.
    type: integer
  maxRatePerEndpoint:
    description: |-
      The max requests per second (RPS) that a single backend network endpoint
      can handle. This is used to calculate the capacity of the group. Can be
      used in either balancing mode. For RATE mode, either maxRate or
      maxRatePerEndpoint must be set.  This cannot be used for internal load
      balancing.
    type: number
  maxRatePerInstance:
    description: |-
      The max requests per second (RPS) that a single backend instance can
      handle. This is used to calculate the capacity of the group. Can be used
      in either balancing mode. For RATE mode, either maxRate or
      maxRatePerInstance must be set.  This cannot be used for internal load
      balancing.
    type: number
  maxUtilization:
    description: |-
      Used when balancingMode is UTILIZATION. This ratio defines the CPU
      utilization target for the group. The default is 0.8. Valid range is [0.0,
      1.0].  This cannot be used for internal load balancing.
