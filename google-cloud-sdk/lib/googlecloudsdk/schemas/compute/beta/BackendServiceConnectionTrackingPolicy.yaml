  connectionPersistenceOnUnhealthyBackends:
    description: |-
      Specifies connection persistence when backends are unhealthy. The default
      value is DEFAULT_FOR_PROTOCOL. If set to DEFAULT_FOR_PROTOCOL, the
      existing connections persist on unhealthy backends only for connection-
      oriented protocols (TCP and SCTP) and only if the Tracking Mode is
      PER_CONNECTION (default tracking mode) or the Session Affinity is
      configured for 5-tuple. They do not persist for UDP.  If set to
      NEVER_PERSIST, after a backend becomes unhealthy, the existing connections
      on the unhealthy backend are never persisted on the unhealthy backend.
      They are always diverted to newly selected healthy backends (unless all
      backends are unhealthy).  If set to ALWAYS_PERSIST, existing connections
      always persist on unhealthy backends regardless of protocol and session
      affinity. It is generally not recommended to use this mode overriding the
      default.
    type: string
    enum:
    - ALWAYS_PERSIST
    - DEFAULT_FOR_PROTOCOL
    - NEVER_PERSIST
  idleTimeoutSec:
    description: |-
      Specifies how long to keep a Connection Tracking entry while there is no
      matching traffic (in seconds).  For L4 ILB the minimum(default) is 10
      minutes and maximum is 16 hours.  For NLB the minimum(default) is 60
      seconds and the maximum is 16 hours.  This field will be supported only if
      the Connection Tracking key is less than 5-tuple.
    type: integer
  trackingMode:
    description: |-
      Specifies the key used for connection tracking. There are two options:
      PER_CONNECTION: This is the default mode. The Connection Tracking is
      performed as per the Connection Key (default Hash Method) for the specific
      protocol.  PER_SESSION: The Connection Tracking is performed as per the
      configured Session Affinity. It matches the configured Session Affinity.
    type: string
    enum:
    - INVALID_TRACKING_MODE
    - PER_CONNECTION
    - PER_SESSION
