  IPAddress:
    description: |-
      The IP address that this forwarding rule is serving on behalf of.
      Addresses are restricted based on the forwarding rule's load balancing
      scheme (EXTERNAL or INTERNAL) and scope (global or regional). When the
      load balancing scheme is EXTERNAL, for global forwarding rules, the
      address must be a global IP, and for regional forwarding rules, the
      address must live in the same region as the forwarding rule. If this field
      is empty, an ephemeral IPv4 address from the same scope (global or
      regional) will be assigned. A regional forwarding rule supports IPv4 only.
      A global forwarding rule supports either IPv4 or IPv6.  When the load
      balancing scheme is INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED, this must be a URL reference to
      an existing Address resource ( internal regional static IP address), with
      a purpose of GCE_END_POINT and address_type of INTERNAL. When the load
      balancing scheme is INTERNAL, this can only be an RFC 1918 IP address
      belonging to the network/subnet configured for the forwarding rule. By
      default, if this field is empty, an ephemeral internal IP address will be
      automatically allocated from the IP range of the subnet or network
      configured for this forwarding rule.  An address can be specified either
      by a literal IP address or a URL reference to an existing Address
      resource. The following examples are all valid:   - 100.1.2.3  -

      The IP protocol to which this rule applies. Valid options are TCP, UDP,
      ESP, AH, SCTP or ICMP.  When the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, only
      TCP and UDP are valid. When the load balancing scheme is
      INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED, only TCPis valid.

  allPorts:
    description: |-
      This field is used along with the backend_service field for internal load
      balancing or with the target field for internal TargetInstance. This field
      cannot be used with port or portRange fields. When the load balancing
      scheme is INTERNAL and protocol is TCP/UDP, specify this field to allow
      packets addressed to any ports will be forwarded to the backends
      configured with this forwarding rule.
    type: boolean
  allowGlobalAccess:
    description: |-
      This field is used along with the backend_service field for internal load
      balancing or with the target field for internal TargetInstance. If the
      field is set to TRUE, clients can access ILB from all regions. Otherwise
      only allows access from clients in the same region as the internal load
      balancer.
    type: boolean
  backendService:
    description: |-
      This field is only used for INTERNAL load balancing.  For internal load
      balancing, this field identifies the BackendService resource to receive
      the matched traffic.

  loadBalancingScheme:
    description: |-
      This signifies what the ForwardingRule will be used for and can only take
      the following values: INTERNAL, INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED, EXTERNAL. The value
      of INTERNAL means that this will be used for Internal Network Load
      Balancing (TCP, UDP). The value of INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED means that this
      will be used for Internal Global HTTP(S) LB. The value of EXTERNAL means
      that this will be used for External Load Balancing (HTTP(S) LB, External
      TCP/UDP LB, SSL Proxy)
    type: string
    enum:
    - EXTERNAL

    - INVALID
  metadataFilters:
    description: |-
      Opaque filter criteria used by Loadbalancer to restrict routing
      configuration to a limited set xDS compliant clients. In their xDS
      requests to Loadbalancer, xDS clients present node metadata. If a match
      takes place, the relevant routing configuration is made available to those
      proxies. For each metadataFilter in this list, if its filterMatchCriteria
      is set to MATCH_ANY, at least one of the filterLabels must match the
      corresponding label provided in the metadata. If its filterMatchCriteria
      is set to MATCH_ALL, then all of its filterLabels must match with
      corresponding labels in the provided metadata. metadataFilters specified
      here can be overridden by those specified in the UrlMap that this
      ForwardingRule references. metadataFilters only applies to Loadbalancers
      that have their loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: MetadataFilter.yaml
  name:
    description: |-
      Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
      RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
      the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the
      first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
      characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
      character, which cannot be a dash.
    type: string
  network:
    description: |-
      This field is not used for external load balancing.  For INTERNAL and
      INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED load balancing, this field identifies the
      network that the load balanced IP should belong to for this Forwarding
      Rule. If this field is not specified, the default network will be
      used.
    type: string
  networkTier:
    description: |-
      This signifies the networking tier used for configuring this load
      balancer and can only take the following values: PREMIUM , STANDARD.
      For regional ForwardingRule, the valid values are PREMIUM and
      STANDARD. For GlobalForwardingRule, the valid value is PREMIUM.  If
      this field is not specified, it is assumed to be PREMIUM. If IPAddress
      is specified, this value must be equal to the networkTier of the
      Address.
    type: string
    enum:
    - PREMIUM
    - SELECT
    - STANDARD
  portRange:
    description: |-
      This field is used along with the target field for TargetHttpProxy,
      TargetHttpsProxy, TargetSslProxy, TargetTcpProxy, TargetVpnGateway,
      TargetPool, TargetInstance.  Applicable only when IPProtocol is TCP,
      UDP, or SCTP, only packets addressed to ports in the specified range
      will be forwarded to target. Forwarding rules with the same
      [IPAddress, IPProtocol] pair must have disjoint port ranges.  Some
      types of forwarding target have constraints on the acceptable ports:
      -
    type: string
  ports:
    description: |-
      This field is used along with the backend_service field for internal
      load balancing.  When the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, a list of
      ports can be configured, for example, ['80'], ['8000','9000'] etc.
      Only packets addressed to these ports will be forwarded to the
      backends configured with this forwarding rule.  You may specify a
      maximum of up to 5 ports.
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
  region:
    description: |-
      [Output Only] URL of the region where the regional forwarding rule
      resides. This field is not applicable to global forwarding rules.
      You must specify this field as part of the HTTP request URL. It is
      not settable as a field in the request body.
    type: string
  selfLink:
    description: '[Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.'
    type: string
  selfLinkWithId:
    description: |-
      [Output Only] Server-defined URL for this resource with the
      resource id.
    type: string
  serviceLabel:
    description: |-
      An optional prefix to the service name for this Forwarding Rule.
      If specified, will be the first label of the fully qualified
      service name.  The label must be 1-63 characters long, and comply
      with RFC1035. Specifically, the label must be 1-63 characters long
      and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?`
      which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and
      all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or
      digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.  This
      field is only used for internal load balancing.
    type: string
  serviceName:
    description: |-
      [Output Only] The internal fully qualified service name for this
      Forwarding Rule.  This field is only used for internal load
      balancing.
    type: string
  subnetwork:
    description: |-
      This field is only used for INTERNAL load balancing.  For internal
      load balancing, this field identifies the subnetwork that the load
      balanced IP should belong to for this Forwarding Rule.  If the
      network specified is in auto subnet mode, this field is optional.
      However, if the network is in custom subnet mode, a subnetwork
      must be specified.
    type: string
  target:
    description: |-
      The URL of the target resource to receive the matched traffic. For
      regional forwarding rules, this target must live in the same
      region as the forwarding rule. For global forwarding rules, this
      target must be a global load balancing resource. The forwarded
      traffic must be of a type appropriate to the target object. For
      INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED load balancing, only HTTP and HTTPS targets
      are valid.
    type: string
