  IPAddress:
    description: |-
      IP address that this forwarding rule serves. When a client sends traffic
      to this IP address, the forwarding rule directs the traffic to the target
      that you specify in the forwarding rule.  If you don't specify a reserved
      IP address, an ephemeral IP address is assigned. Methods for specifying an
      IP address:  * IPv4 dotted decimal, as in `100.1.2.3` * Full URL, as in
      https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v
      1/projects/project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name * Partial URL
      or by name, as in:   -
      projects/project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name  -
      regions/region/addresses/address-name  - global/addresses/address-name -
      address-name    The loadBalancingScheme and the forwarding rule's target
      determine the type of IP address that you can use. For detailed
      information, refer to [IP address specifications](/load-
      balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#ip_address_specifications). Must
      be set to `0.0.0.0` when the target is targetGrpcProxy that has
      validateForProxyless field set to true.  For Private Service Connect
      forwarding rules that forward traffic to Google APIs, IP address must be
      provided.
    type: string
  IPProtocol:
    description: |-
      The IP protocol to which this rule applies.  For protocol forwarding,
      valid options are TCP, UDP, ESP, AH, SCTP and ICMP.  The valid IP
      protocols are different for different load balancing products: - Internal
      TCP/UDP Load Balancing: The load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, and one of
      TCP, UDP or ALL is valid.  - Traffic Director: The load balancing scheme
      is INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED, and only TCP is valid. - Internal HTTP(S) Load
      Balancing: The load balancing scheme is INTERNAL_MANAGED, and only TCP is
      valid.  - HTTP(S), SSL Proxy, and TCP Proxy Load Balancing: The load
      balancing scheme is EXTERNAL and only TCP is valid.  - Network Load
      Balancing: The load balancing scheme is EXTERNAL, and one of TCP or UDP is
      valid.

  allPorts:
    description: |-
      This field is used along with the backend_service field for internal load
      balancing or with the target field for internal TargetInstance. This field
      cannot be used with port or portRange fields. When the load balancing
      scheme is INTERNAL and protocol is TCP/UDP, specify this field to allow
      packets addressed to any ports will be forwarded to the backends
      configured with this forwarding rule.
    type: boolean
  allowGlobalAccess:
    description: |-
      This field is used along with the backend_service field for internal load
      balancing or with the target field for internal TargetInstance. If the
      field is set to TRUE, clients can access ILB from all regions. Otherwise
      only allows access from clients in the same region as the internal load
      balancer.
    type: boolean
  backendService:
    description: |-
      Identifies the backend service to which the forwarding rule sends traffic.
      Required for Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing and Network Load Balancing;
      must be omitted for all other load balancer types.

  isMirroringCollector:
    description: |-
      Indicates whether or not this load balancer can be used as a collector for
      packet mirroring. To prevent mirroring loops, instances behind this load
      balancer will not have their traffic mirrored even if a PacketMirroring
      rule applies to them. This can only be set to true for load balancers that
      have their loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL.

  loadBalancingScheme:
    description: |-
      Specifies the forwarding rule type.    - EXTERNAL is used for:   - Classic
      Cloud VPN gateways  - Protocol forwarding to VMs from an external IP
      address  - HTTP(S), SSL Proxy, TCP Proxy, and Network Load Balancing     -
      INTERNAL is used for:   - Protocol forwarding to VMs from an internal IP
      address  - Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing    - INTERNAL_MANAGED is used
      for:   - Internal HTTP(S) Load Balancing    - INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED is
      used for:   - Traffic Director For more information about forwarding
      rules, refer to Forwarding rule concepts.

  metadataFilters:
    description: |-
      Opaque filter criteria used by Loadbalancer to restrict routing
      configuration to a limited set of xDS compliant clients. In their xDS
      requests to Loadbalancer, xDS clients present node metadata. When there is
      a match, the relevant configuration is made available to those proxies.
      Otherwise, all the resources (e.g. TargetHttpProxy, UrlMap) referenced by
      the ForwardingRule will not be visible to those proxies. For each
      metadataFilter in this list, if its filterMatchCriteria is set to
      MATCH_ANY, at least one of the filterLabels must match the corresponding
      label provided in the metadata. If its filterMatchCriteria is set to
      MATCH_ALL, then all of its filterLabels must match with corresponding
      labels provided in the metadata. If multiple metadataFilters are
      specified, all of them need to be satisfied in order to be considered a
      match. metadataFilters specified here will be applifed before those
      specified in the UrlMap that this ForwardingRule references.
      metadataFilters only applies to Loadbalancers that have their
      loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.

  name:
    description: |-
      Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
      RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
      the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the
      first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
      characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
      character, which cannot be a dash.
    type: string
  network:
    description: |-
      This field is not used for external load balancing.  For Internal
      TCP/UDP Load Balancing, this field identifies the network that the
      load balanced IP should belong to for this Forwarding Rule. If this
      field is not specified, the default network will be used.  For Private
      Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to Google APIs,
      a network must be provided.
    type: string
  networkTier:
    description: |-
      This signifies the networking tier used for configuring this load
      balancer and can only take the following values: PREMIUM, STANDARD.
      For regional ForwardingRule, the valid values are PREMIUM and
      STANDARD. For GlobalForwardingRule, the valid value is PREMIUM.  If
      this field is not specified, it is assumed to be PREMIUM. If IPAddress
      is specified, this value must be equal to the networkTier of the
      Address.

    enum:
    - FIXED_STANDARD
    - PREMIUM
    - SELECT

  portRange:
    description: |-
      This field can be used only if: * Load balancing scheme is one of
      EXTERNAL,  INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED or INTERNAL_MANAGED, and * IPProtocol
      is one of TCP, UDP, or SCTP.  Packets addressed to ports in the
      specified range will be forwarded to target or  backend_service. You
      can only use one of ports, port_range, or allPorts. The three are
      mutually exclusive. Forwarding rules with the same [IPAddress,
      IPProtocol] pair must have disjoint port ranges.  Some types of
      forwarding target have constraints on the acceptable ports:   -
    type: string
  ports:
    description: |-
      The ports field is only supported when the forwarding rule references
      a backend_service directly. Supported load balancing products are
      Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing and Network Load Balancing. Only
      packets addressed to the specified list of ports are forwarded to
      backends.  You can only use one of ports and port_range, or allPorts.
      The three are mutually exclusive.  You can specify a list of up to
      five ports, which can be non-contiguous.  For Internal TCP/UDP Load
      Balancing, if you specify allPorts, you should not specify ports.  For
      more information, see [Port specifications](/load-
      balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#port_specifications).
