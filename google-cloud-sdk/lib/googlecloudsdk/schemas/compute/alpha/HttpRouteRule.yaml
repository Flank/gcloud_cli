  routeAction:
    description: |-
      In response to a matching matchRule, the load balancer performs
      advanced routing actions like URL rewrites, header transformations,
      etc. prior to forwarding the request to the selected backend. If
      routeAction specifies any  weightedBackendServices, service must not
      be set. Conversely if service is set, routeAction cannot contain any
      weightedBackendServices. Only one of routeAction or urlRedirect must
      be set.
    $ref: HttpRouteAction.yaml
  service:
    description: |-
      The full or partial URL of the backend service resource to which
      traffic is directed if this rule is matched. If routeAction is
      additionally specified, advanced routing actions like URL Rewrites,
      etc. take effect prior to sending the request to the backend. However,
      if service is specified, routeAction cannot contain any
      weightedBackendService s. Conversely, if routeAction specifies any
      weightedBackendServices, service must not be specified. Only one of
      urlRedirect, service or routeAction.weightedBackendService must be
      set.
    type: string
  urlRedirect:
    description: |-
      When this rule is matched, the request is redirected to a URL
      specified by urlRedirect. If urlRedirect is specified, service or
      routeAction must not be set.
