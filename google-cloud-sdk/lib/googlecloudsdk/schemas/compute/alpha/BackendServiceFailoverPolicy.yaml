  disableConnectionDrainOnFailover:
    description: |-
      On failover or failback, this field indicates whether connection drain
      will be honored. Setting this to true has the following effect:
      connections to the old active pool are not drained. Connections to the new
      active pool use the timeout of 10 min (currently fixed). Setting to false
      has the following effect: both old and new connections will have a drain
      timeout of 10 min.  This can be set to true only if the protocol is TCP.
      The default is false.
    type: boolean
  dropTrafficIfUnhealthy:
    description: |-
      This option is used only when no healthy VMs are detected in the primary
      and backup instance groups. When set to true, traffic is dropped. When set
      to false, new connections are sent across all VMs in the primary group.
      The default is false.
    type: boolean
  failoverRatio:
    description: |-
      The value of the field must be in [0, 1]. If the ratio of the healthy VMs
      in the primary backend is at or below this number, traffic arriving at the
      load-balanced IP will be directed to the failover backend.  In case where
      'failoverRatio' is not set or all the VMs in the backup backend are
      unhealthy, the traffic will be directed back to the primary backend in the
      "force" mode, where traffic will be spread to the healthy VMs with the
      best effort, or to all VMs when no VM is healthy.  This field is only used
      with l4 load balancing.
