      type: string
  automaticRestart:
    description: |-
      Specifies whether the instance should be automatically restarted if it is
      terminated by Compute Engine (not terminated by a user). You can only set
      the automatic restart option for standard instances. Preemptible instances
      cannot be automatically restarted.  By default, this is set to true so an
      instance is automatically restarted if it is terminated by Compute Engine.
    type: boolean
  availabilityDomain:
    description: |-
      Specifies the availability domain (AD), which this instance should be
      scheduled on. The AD belongs to the spread GroupPlacementPolicy resource
      policy that has been assigned to the instance. Specify a value between
      1-max count of availability domains in your GroupPlacementPolicy. See
      go/placement-policy-extension for more details.
    type: integer
  latencyTolerant:
    description: |-
      Defines whether the instance is tolerant of higher cpu latency. This can
      only be set during instance creation, or when the instance is not
      currently running. It must not be set if the preemptible option is also
      set.
    type: boolean
  locationHint:
    description: |-
      An opaque location hint used to place the instance close to other
      resources. This field is for use by internal tools that use the public
      API.
    type: string
  maintenanceFreezeDurationHours:
    description: |-
      Specifies the number of hours after instance creation where the instance
      won't be scheduled for maintenance.
    type: integer
  maintenanceInterval:
    description: |-
      Specifies whether this VM may be a stable fleet VM. Setting this to
      "Periodic" designates this VM as a Stable Fleet VM.  See go/stable-fleet-
      ug for more details.
    type: string
    enum:
    - PERIODIC
  minNodeCpus:
    description: |-
      The minimum number of virtual CPUs this instance will consume when running
      on a sole-tenant node.
    type: integer
  nodeAffinities:
    description: |-
      A set of node affinity and anti-affinity configurations. Refer to
      Configuring node affinity for more information. Overrides
      reservationAffinity.
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: SchedulingNodeAffinity.yaml
  onHostMaintenance:
    description: |-
      Defines the maintenance behavior for this instance. For standard
      instances, the default behavior is MIGRATE. For preemptible instances,
      the default and only possible behavior is TERMINATE. For more
      information, see Setting Instance Scheduling Options.
    type: string
    enum:
    - MIGRATE
    - TERMINATE
  preemptible:
    description: |-
      Defines whether the instance is preemptible. This can only be set
      during instance creation or while the instance is stopped and
      therefore, in a `TERMINATED` state. See Instance Life Cycle for more
      information on the possible instance states.
    type: boolean
