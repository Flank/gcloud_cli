    Topic ID.

subscription-name:
  api_field: subscriptionId
  arg_name: subscription

    Topic ID associated with the subscription.

partitions:
  api_field: topic.partitionConfig.count
  arg_name: partitions
  required: false
  help_text: |
    Number of partitions in the topic.

per-partition-publish-mib:
  api_field: topic.partitionConfig.capacity.publishMibPerSec
  arg_name: per-partition-publish-mib
  required: false
  help_text: |
    Topic partition publish throughput capacity in MiB/s. Must be between 4 and 16.

per-partition-subscribe-mib:
  api_field: topic.partitionConfig.capacity.subscribeMibPerSec
  arg_name: per-partition-subscribe-mib

    Topic partition subscribe throughput capacity in MiB/s. Must be between 4 and 32.

per-partition-bytes:
  api_field: topic.retentionConfig.perPartitionBytes
  arg_name: per-partition-bytes
  type: googlecloudsdk.core.util.scaled_integer:ParseInteger
  required: false
  help_text: |
    Provisioned storage, in bytes, per partition. If the number of bytes
    stored in any of the topic's partitions exceeds this value, older
    messages will be dropped to make room for newer ones, regardless of the
    value of `message-retention-period`.
    A valid example value of this flag would be `per-partition-bytes=30GiB`.

message-retention-period:
  api_field: topic.retentionConfig.period
  arg_name: message-retention-period
  type: googlecloudsdk.core.util.times:ParseDuration
  processor: googlecloudsdk.command_lib.pubsub.lite_util:DurationToSeconds
  required: false
  help_text: |
    How long a published message is retained. If unset, messages will only be
    dropped to make space for new ones once the `per-partition-bytes` limit is
    reached.
    A valid example value of this flag would be `message-retention-period="2w"`.

delivery-requirement:
  api_field: subscription.deliveryConfig.deliveryRequirement
  arg_name: delivery-requirement
  choices:
  - arg_value: deliver-immediately
    enum_value: DELIVER_IMMEDIATELY
  - arg_value: deliver-after-stored
    enum_value: DELIVER_AFTER_STORED
  help_text: |
    When this subscription should send messages to subscribers relative to
    messages persistence in storage.
    See https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/lite/docs/subscriptions#creating_lite_subscriptions
    for more info.

# TODO(b/183139642): Make starting-offset flag case-insensitive
starting-offset:
  arg_name: starting-offset
  choices:
  - arg_value: beginning
  - arg_value: end
  help_text: |
    The offset at which a newly created or seeked subscription will start receiving messages. A
    subscription can be initialized at the offset of the oldest retained message (`beginning`), or
    at the current HEAD offset (`end`).

publish-time:
  arg_name: publish-time
  type: googlecloudsdk.calliope.arg_parsers:Datetime.Parse
  help_text: |
    The publish time to seek a subscription to. Messages with publish time greater than or equal to
    this time will be delivered post-seek.
    Run $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on time formats.

event-time:
  arg_name: event-time
  type: googlecloudsdk.calliope.arg_parsers:Datetime.Parse
  help_text: |
    The event time to seek a subscription to. Seeks to the first message with event time greater
    than or equal to the specified event time. As event times are user supplied, subsequent messages
    may have event times less than the specified event time and should be filtered by the client, if
    necessary. Messages missing an event time use publish time as a fallback.
    Run $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on time formats.

operation-done:
  arg_name: done
  required: false
  # Not a bool type to allow one of: true|false|unspecified
  choices:
  - arg_value: 'true'
  - arg_value: 'false'
  type: googlecloudsdk.command_lib.util.hooks.types:LowerCaseType
  help_text: |
    Filter operations by completion status. This flag is ignored if `--filter` is set.

operation-subscription:
  arg_name: subscription
  required: false
  help_text: |
    Filter operations by target subscription. This flag is ignored if `--filter` is set.

partition:
  api_field: commitCursorRequest.partition
  arg_name: partition
  required: true
  help_text: |
    The topic partition. Partitions are zero indexed, so the partition must be in the range
    [0, topic.num_partitions). If you do not know your topic.num_partitions, run `gcloud pubsub
    lite-topic describe TOPIC --zone=ZONE`.

offset:
  api_field: commitCursorRequest.cursor.offset
  arg_name: offset
  required: true
  help_text: |
    The offset of a message within a topic partition. Must be greater than or equal to 0.
