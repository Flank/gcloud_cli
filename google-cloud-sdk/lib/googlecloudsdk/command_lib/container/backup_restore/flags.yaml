    Delete lock days specifies the number of days from the create_time of this
    Backup before which deletion will be blocked. For automatically created
    Backup from schedule, this field will be set to the

    Manual creation of a backup with this field unspecified causes the service
    to use the value of backupPlan.RetentionPolicy.backupDeleteBlockDays.
    Creation of a backup with this field set to a value SMALLER than
    backupPlan.RetentionPolicy.backupDeleteBlockDays results in an invalid
    response from the service.
    This field MUST be an int value between 0-90(inclusive).
    This field may only be INCREASED in an update command, or an invalid
    response will be returned by the service.

    Manual creation of a backup with this field unspecified causes the service
    to use the value of backupPlan.retentionPolicy.backupRetainDays.
    Creation of a Backup with this field set to a value SMALLER than
    delete_lock_days results in an invalid response from the service.
    This field may ONLY be increased in an Update request, or an invalid
    response will be returned by the service immediately.
