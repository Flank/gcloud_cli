"""Abstract operation class that command operations will inherit from.

Should typically be executed in a task iterator through

Manual execution example:

>>> class CopyTask(Task):
...   def __init__(self, src, dest):
...     ...
>>> my_copy_task = new CopyTask('~/Desktop/memes.jpg', '/kernel/')
>>> my_copy_task.Execute()
