# TODO(b/124305522): Remove this and use wasmPlugin above.
#
# Non-positional gcloud flags use hyphens rather than underscores.
# However, the logic that generates non-positonal flags from resources.yaml
# entries does not perform this translation, which results in these flags
# having underscores. To work around this, we declare the wasmPluginHyphen
# resource, in addition to the wasmPlugin resource above. wasmPluginHyphen
# explicitly specifies an attribute_name that uses a hyphen. We use
# wasmPluginHyphen in contexts where we emit a non-positional flag (which
# use hyphens), and wasmPlugin in contexts where we emit a positional flag
# (which use underscores).
