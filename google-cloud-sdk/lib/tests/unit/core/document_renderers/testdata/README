gcloud-compute-ssh

    Patches to PuTTY for 'gcloud compute ssh' on Windows.

overview
    Patch Windows PuTTY so that after
      o copy pscp.exe scp.exe
      o copy plink.exe ssh.exe
      o copy pkeygen.exe ssh-keygen.exe
    scp, ssh and ssh-keygen, from the command line, behave more like the
    OpenSsh counterparts. Some behaviors are not covered -- mainly just enough
    to support internal gcloud usage patterns.

details
    Changes fall into a few categories:
      o Change cmdgen.c to generate pkeygen.exe which acts like ssh-keygen
        from the command line. Most of the changes are in this file. Major
        changes:
        * use windows libraries to generate cryptographic random data
        * output refactored to a loop that can generate more than one file
        * id, id.pub and id.ppk all generated by default
      o Change all identity file read acceses to first check for a .ppk
        variant, for example, ``-i id'' will first check for id.ppk. This
        preserves the ssh and scp -i usage pattern.
      o Change the default TERM environment variable value passed to the
        server by plink to check the local TERM setting (instead of "xterm").
        If TERM is not set then "dumb" is used. This gives the proper hint to
        remote .profiles to refrain from colorizing prompts and ls(1) output.
      o Eliminate the low hanging fruit of the MSVC 32 and 64 bit warnings.
        Most of these involve mixed combinations of [unsigned] int, [unsigned]
        long, size_t, and ssize_t. Some only show up in 64 bit compiles. Other
        culprits are strcpy(), strcat(), and sprintf() into fixed size buffers
        - they are handled by a homebrew szprintf() that supports a clean sized
        buffer paradigm. Much more work is needed in this area. A lot of the
        (int) and (size_t) casts should be replaced by proper variable and
        function typing, but that would require a meticulous code walkthrough.

coverage
    Link types:
      o And download this (ftp://foo.com/bar) there.
      o And look at this (http://foo.com/bar) there.
      o And jump here there.
      o And look at this (https://foo.com/bar) there.
      o And mail bozo there.

    Corner cases:
      o And check this [really!!]catenated.
      o This path */*.c is not bold.
      o This path */_.c is not italic.

    This tests dangling embellishments that should not bleed into the next
    section.

examples
    This is an example ``command'' line:

        $ echo 'example command line'

next section
    This text should not be embellished.

NOTES
    A special note.
