.SH "SYNOPSIS"

\f5gcloud markdown\fR \fICOMMAND\fR [\fB\-\-optional\-flag\fR\ \fIOPTIONAL_FLAG\fR] \fB\-\-required\-flag\fR \fIREQUIRED_FLAG\fR [\fIGCLOUD\-WIDE\-FLAG\ ...\fR]


.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Markdown group docstring description.

This is a markdown test. If you change the docstrings or help strings or
argparse flags or argparse positionals in this file you should get test
regressions.

Markdown DESCRIPTION detailed_help. The index entry is \f5\fIMarkdown group
docstring index.\fR\fR. Here comes \fIitalic\fR emphasis. And here comes
\fBbold\fR emphasis. And asciidoc(1) says \f5monospace\fR looks like this, but I
think its really literal. And Cloud SDK has its own \f5\fItext\fR\fR emphasis.

Markdown lists are supported:

.RS 2m
.IP "\(bu" 2m
First item.
.RS 2m
.IP "\(em" 2m
First sub\-item.
.RE
.sp
.IP "\(bu" 2m
Second item.
.IP "\(bu" 2m
Last item for now.
.RS 2m
.IP "\(em" 2m
Last sub\-item for now.

Did the end of list work? Also, tables are recognized:


.TS
tab(	);
lB lB lB
l l l.
Alias	Project	Image Name
a1a1a	p1p1p	i1ii1
a222	p2	i22222i2222
a3aaaa3a3a3	p3p3pp3p	iii3i3i
.TE

Did the end of table work?

I don't, you won't 'and' they didn't.

Look at the files matching $HOME/*.txt or */x.

And some manpage \fBssh\fR(1)/\fBscp\fR(1) references. And alternate
\fBssh(1)\fR/\fBscp(1)\fR style too.

Or maybe */* and *.go or why *.py.

And what \f5\fIhappens\fR\fR with \f5\fIair quotes\fR\fR. And \fIthen\fR there's
\'literal' quotes too.

Perhaps *.c?

And here are some hanging indent lists:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fBouter\fR
This is a big category:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fBinner\-1\fR
This is an inline example.
.TP 2m
\fBinner\-2\fR
Another example with no line separation.
.TP 2m
\fBinner\-3\fR
And a third one. With blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
blah blah blah wrapping text.
.TP 2m
\fBinner\-4\fR
On a separate line. With more blah blah blah blah blah. And a second line.

.RE
.sp
.TP 2m
\fBouter\-2\fR
And a smaller category:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fBinner\-2\-1\fR
This is the first inner of the second outer.

And this is the second paragraph of the first inner of the second outer.

.RE
.RE
.sp
And this should be back to normal text.

.RS 2m
$ gcloud with a command line EXAMPLE
.RE

and more prose

.RS 2m
# example command.
$ echo and more commands
.RE

And the conclusion.

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fBmarkdown\-command\fR
Markdown command docstring index.


.RE
.sp

.SH "EXAMPLES"

Inline $ gcloud command\-group sub\-sommand POSITIONAL command examples should
become links. And example blocks should be monospace with links:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud group sub\-command list POSITIONAL
$ gcloud upper case stop command ABC\-DEF abc xyz
$ gcloud group\-a command example\-arg a b c
$ gcloud group\-b subgroup\-c command my\-arg a b c
$ gcloud with group sample\-arg a b c
$ gcloud group set property value a b c
$ gcloud group unset property a b c
.RE

Long examples should scroll horizontally:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud group long\-windeded super\-verbose way too\-long who\-could \e
    ever remember\-this obscure\-command maybe too much of\-the \e
    underlying\-api IS EXPOSED
.RE

And how does a multi\-line example fare?

.RS 2m
$ gcloud first part
$ gcloud second part
.RE

And the conclusion.


.SH "NOTES"
A special note.
