NAME
    gcloud markdown - markdown group docstring index

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud markdown COMMAND [--optional-flag OPTIONAL_FLAG] --required-flag
        REQUIRED_FLAG [GLOBAL-FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Markdown group docstring description.

    This is a markdown test. If you change the docstrings or help strings or
    argparse flags or argparse positionals in this file you should get test
    regressions.

    Markdown DESCRIPTION detailed_help. The index entry is Markdown group
    docstring index.. Here comes italic emphasis. And here comes bold emphasis.
    And asciidoc(1) says monospace looks like this, but I think its really
    literal. And Cloud SDK has its own text emphasis.

    Markdown lists are supported:

      o First item.
        * First sub-item.
      o Second item.
      o Last item for now.
        * Last sub-item for now.

    Did the end of list work? Also, format="csv" tables are recognized:

      Alias       Project  Image Name
      a1a1a       p1p1p    i1ii1
      a222        p2       i22222i2222
      a3aaaa3a3a3 p3p3pp3p iii3i3i

    Did the end of table work?

    I don't, you won't 'and' they didn't.

    Look at the files matching $HOME/*.txt or */x.

    And some manpage ssh(1)/scp(1) references. And alternate ssh(1)/scp(1)
    style too.

    Or maybe */* and *.go or why *.py.

    And what happens with air quotes. And then there's 'literal' quotes too.

    Perhaps *.c?

    And here are some hanging indent lists:

     outer
        This is a big category:

         inner-1
            This is an inline example.
         inner-2
            Another example with no line separation.
         inner-3
            And a third one. With blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
            blah blah blah blah blah wrapping text.
         inner-4
            On a separate line. With more blah blah blah blah blah. And a
            second line.

     outer-2
        And a smaller category:

         inner-2-1
            This is the first inner of the second outer.

            And this is the second paragraph of the first inner of the second
            outer.

    And this should be back to normal text.

        $ gcloud with a command line EXAMPLE

    and more prose

        # example command.
        $ echo and more commands

    And the conclusion.

FLAGS
     --optional-flag OPTIONAL_FLAG
        Optional flag.

     --required-flag REQUIRED_FLAG
        Required flag.

GLOBAL FLAGS
    Run $ gcloud help for a description of flags available to all commands.

COMMANDS
    COMMAND is one of the following:

     markdown-command
        Markdown command docstring index.

EXAMPLES
    Inline $ gcloud command-group sub-sommand POSITIONAL command examples
    should become links. And example blocks should be monospace with links:

        $ gcloud group sub-command list POSITIONAL
        $ gcloud upper case stop command ABC-DEF abc xyz
        $ gcloud group-a command example-arg a b c
        $ gcloud group-b subgroup-c command my-arg a b c
        $ gcloud with group sample-arg a b c
        $ gcloud group set property value a b c
        $ gcloud group unset property a b c

    Long examples should wrap at 80 characters:

        $ gcloud group long-windeded super-verbose way too-long who-could \
            ever remember-this obscure-command maybe too much of-the \
            underlying-api IS EXPOSED

    And how does a multi-line example fare?

        $ gcloud first part
        $ gcloud second part

    And the conclusion.

NOTES
    A special note.
