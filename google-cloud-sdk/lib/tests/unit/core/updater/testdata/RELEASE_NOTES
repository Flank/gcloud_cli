    managed list" command.

    ## trying to throw off the parser
*   Fixed a bug related to checking for SDK updates when the SDK is installed as
    root (like on Debian GCE images).
    *   Affected users should now see less frequent update messages and overall
        improved gcloud performance
*   `gcloud preview app deploy` won't update local images automatically anymore.

## 0.9.75 (2015/08/26)

*   Container Engine
    *   Container Engine GA commands available under `gcloud container`.
    *   `gcloud beta container get-credentials` now takes cluster name as argument
        instead of `--cluster` flag for consistency with other commands.
    *   Added `gcloud alpha container clusters update <cluster>
        --cloud-monitoring=<val>` command.
*   New release notes are printed on upgrade. (This won't take effect until
    an upgrade from this version to a later version.)
*   New `gcloud alpha genomics variantsets export` command.
*   Commands promoted from `gcloud alpha` to `gcloud beta`:
    *    `gcloud beta config configurations ...`
    *    `gcloud beta sources clone`
*   Improvements in error reporting and default output formatting.


## 0.9.74 (2015/08/19)

*   New list and import commands under `gcloud alpha genomics variants`.
*   Removed `--remote` flag. Instead, please use the `--docker-build=remote`
    flag (or use `--docker-build=local` to force a local build).
*   In this release, Docker builds are hosted by default. To opt-in to the old
    behavior, please use the `--docker-build=local` flag.
