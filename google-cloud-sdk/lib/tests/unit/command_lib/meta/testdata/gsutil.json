        "DESCRIPTION": "The acl command has three sub-commands:",
        "SET": "The \"acl set\" command allows you to set an Access Control List on one or\nmore buckets and objects. The simplest way to use it is to specify one of\nthe canned ACLs, e.g.,:\n\n  gsutil acl set private gs://bucket\n\nIf you want to make an object or bucket publicly readable or writable, it is\nrecommended to use \"acl ch\", to avoid accidentally removing OWNER permissions.\nSee \"gsutil help acl ch\" for details.\n\nSee \"gsutil help acls\" for a list of all canned ACLs.\n\nIf you want to define more fine-grained control over your data, you can\nretrieve an ACL using the \"acl get\" command, save the output to a file, edit\nthe file, and then use the \"acl set\" command to set that ACL on the buckets\nand/or objects. For example:\n\n  gsutil acl get gs://bucket/file.txt > acl.txt\n\nMake changes to acl.txt such as adding an additional grant, then:\n\n  gsutil acl set acl.txt gs://cats/file.txt\n\nNote that you can set an ACL on multiple buckets or objects at once,\nfor example:\n\n  gsutil acl set acl.txt gs://bucket/*.jpg\n\nIf you have a large number of ACLs to update you might want to use the\ngsutil -m option, to perform a parallel (multi-threaded/multi-processing)\nupdate:\n\n  gsutil -m acl set acl.txt gs://bucket/*.jpg\n\nNote that multi-threading/multi-processing is only done when the named URLs\nrefer to objects, which happens either if you name specific objects or\nif you enumerate objects by using an object wildcard or specifying\nthe acl -r flag."
