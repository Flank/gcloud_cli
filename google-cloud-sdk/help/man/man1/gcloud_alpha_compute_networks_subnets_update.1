.SH "FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-aggregation\-interval\fR=\fIAGGREGATION_INTERVAL\fR
Can only be specified if VPC Flow Logs for this subnetwork is enabled. Toggles
the aggregation interval for collecting flow logs. Increasing the interval time
will reduce the amount of generated flow logs for long lasting connections.
Default is an interval of 5 seconds per connection. \fIAGGREGATION_INTERVAL\fR
must be one of: \fBinterval\-10\-min\fR, \fBinterval\-15\-min\fR,
\fBinterval\-1\-min\fR, \fBinterval\-30\-sec\fR, \fBinterval\-5\-min\fR,
\fBinterval\-5\-sec\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-drain\-timeout\fR=\fIDRAIN_TIMEOUT\fR; default="0s"
The time period for draining traffic from Internal HTTP(S) Load Balancer proxies
that are assigned addresses in the current ACTIVE subnetwork. For example,
\f5\fI1h\fR\fR, \f5\fI60m\fR\fR and \f5\fI3600s\fR\fR each specify a duration of
1 hour for draining the traffic. Longer times reduce the number of proxies that
are draining traffic at any one time, and so improve the availability of proxies
for load balancing. The drain timeout is only applicable when the
[\-\-role=ACTIVE] flag is being used.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-flow\-sampling\fR=\fIFLOW_SAMPLING\fR
Can only be specified if VPC Flow Logs for this subnetwork is enabled. The value
of the field must be in [0, 1]. Set the sampling rate of VPC Flow Logs within
the subnetwork where 1.0 means all collected logs are reported and 0.0 means no
logs are reported. Default is 0.5 which means half of all collected logs are
reported.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-logging\-aggregation\-interval\fR=\fILOGGING_AGGREGATION_INTERVAL\fR
Can only be specified if VPC Flow Logs for this subnetwork is enabled. Toggles
the aggregation interval for collecting flow logs. Increasing the interval time
will reduce the amount of generated flow logs for long lasting connections.
Default is an interval of 5 seconds per connection.
\fILOGGING_AGGREGATION_INTERVAL\fR must be one of: \fBinterval\-10\-min\fR,
\fBinterval\-15\-min\fR, \fBinterval\-1\-min\fR, \fBinterval\-30\-sec\fR,
\fBinterval\-5\-min\fR, \fBinterval\-5\-sec\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-logging\-filter\-expr\fR=\fILOGGING_FILTER_EXPR\fR
Can only be specified if VPC Flow Logs for this subnetwork is enabled. Export
filter used to define which logs should be generated.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-logging\-flow\-sampling\fR=\fILOGGING_FLOW_SAMPLING\fR
Can only be specified if VPC Flow logs for this subnetwork is enabled. The value
of the field must be in [0, 1]. Set the sampling rate of VPC flow logs within
the subnetwork where 1.0 means all collected logs are reported and 0.0 means no
logs are reported. Default is 0.5 which means half of all collected logs are
reported.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-logging\-metadata\fR=\fILOGGING_METADATA\fR
Can only be specified if VPC Flow Logs for this subnetwork is enabled.
Configures whether metadata fields should be added to the reported logs. Default
is to include all metadata. Note that "include\-all" does not include GKE
annotations. \fILOGGING_METADATA\fR must be one of: \fBcustom\fR,
\fBexclude\-all\fR, \fBinclude\-all\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-logging\-metadata\-fields\fR=[\fIMETADATA_FIELD\fR,...]
Can only be specified if VPC Flow Logs for this subnetwork is enabled and
"metadata" is set to CUSTOM_METADATA. The comma\-separated list of metadata
fields that should be added to reported logs.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-metadata\fR=\fIMETADATA\fR
Can only be specified if VPC Flow Logs for this subnetwork is enabled.
Configures whether metadata fields should be added to the reported logs. Default
is to include all metadata. Note that "include\-all" does not include GKE
annotations. \fIMETADATA\fR must be one of: \fBexclude\-all\-metadata\fR,
\fBinclude\-all\-metadata\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-region\fR=\fIREGION\fR
Region of the subnetwork to update. If not specified, you may be prompted to
select a region.

To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
\f5\fIcompute/region\fR\fR property:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config set compute/region REGION
.RE

A list of regions can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute regions list
.RE

To unset the property, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config unset compute/region
.RE

Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
\f5\fICLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION\fR\fR.

.TP 2m

At most one of these may be specified:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-add\-secondary\-ranges\fR=\fIPROPERTY\fR=\fIVALUE\fR,[...]
Adds secondary IP ranges to the subnetwork for use in IP aliasing.

For example, \f5\-\-add\-secondary\-ranges range1=192.168.64.0/24\fR adds a
secondary range 192.168.64.0/24 with name range1.

.RS 2m
.IP "\(bu" 2m
\f5RANGE_NAME\fR \- Name of the secondary range.
.IP "\(bu" 2m
\f5RANGE\fR \- \f5IP range in CIDR format.\fR

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-[no\-]enable\-flow\-logs\fR
Enable/disable VPC Flow Logs for this subnet. If the subnet does not support VPC
Flow Logs, this flag has no effect. For more information, see
https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/using\-flow\-logs. Use
\fB\-\-enable\-flow\-logs\fR to enable and \fB\-\-no\-enable\-flow\-logs\fR to
disable.

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-[no\-]enable\-private\-ip\-google\-access\fR
Enable/disable access to Google Cloud APIs from this subnet for instances
without a public ip address. Use \fB\-\-enable\-private\-ip\-google\-access\fR
to enable and \fB\-\-no\-enable\-private\-ip\-google\-access\fR to disable.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-private\-ipv6\-google\-access\-type\fR=\fIPRIVATE_IPV6_GOOGLE_ACCESS_TYPE\fR
The private IPv6 google access type for the VMs in this subnet.
\fIPRIVATE_IPV6_GOOGLE_ACCESS_TYPE\fR must be one of: \fBdisable\fR,
\fBenable\-bidirectional\-access\fR, \fBenable\-outbound\-vm\-access\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-remove\-secondary\-ranges\fR=\fIPROPERTY\fR=\fIVALUE\fR,[...]
Removes secondary ranges from the subnetwork.

For example, \f5\-\-remove\-secondary\-ranges range2,range3\fR removes the
secondary ranges with names range2 and range3.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-role\fR=\fIROLE\fR
The role is set to ACTIVE to update a BACKUP reserved address range to be the
new ACTIVE address range. Note that the only supported value for this flag is
ACTIVE since setting an address range to BACKUP is not supported.

This field is only valid when updating a reserved IP address range used for the
purpose of Internal HTTP(S) Load Balancer.

\fIROLE\fR must be (currently only one value is supported):

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fBACTIVE\fR
The ACTIVE subnet that is currently used.
