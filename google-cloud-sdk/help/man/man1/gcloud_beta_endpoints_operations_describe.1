.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(BETA)\fR This command will return information about an operation given the
name of that operation.

The amount of information inside an operation can be very large, so by default,
only a summary is returned. If you want the entire operation resource, you can
include the \f5\-\-full\fR flag.

Note that the \f5operations/\fR prefix of the operation name is optional and may
be omitted.
