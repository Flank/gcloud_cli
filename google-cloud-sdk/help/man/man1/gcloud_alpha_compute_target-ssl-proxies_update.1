.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR \fBgcloud alpha compute target\-ssl\-proxies update\fR is used to
replace the SSL certificate, backend service, proxy header or SSL policy of
existing target SSL proxies. A target SSL proxy is referenced by one or more
forwarding rules which define which packets the proxy is responsible for
routing. The target SSL proxy in turn points to a backend service which will
handle the requests. The target SSL proxy also points to at most 15 SSL
certificates used for server\-side authentication. The target SSL proxy can be
associated with at most one SSL policy.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-ssl\-certificates\fR=\fISSL_CERTIFICATE\fR,[...]
References to at most 15 SSL certificate resources that are used for
server\-side authentication. The first SSL certificate in this list is
considered the primary SSL certificate associated with the load balancer. The
SSL certificates must exist and cannot be deleted while referenced by a target
SSL proxy.

.TP 2m

At most one of these may be specified:

\fB\-\-clear\-ssl\-policy\fR
Removes any attached SSL policy from the SSL proxy.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-ssl\-policy\fR=\fISSL_POLICY\fR
A reference to an SSL policy resource that defines the server\-side support for
SSL features and affects the connections between clients and the SSL proxy load
balancer. The SSL policy must exist and cannot be deleted while referenced by a
target SSL proxy.
