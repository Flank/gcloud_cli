.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR \fBgcloud alpha compute target\-https\-proxies update\fR is used
to change the SSL certificate and/or URL map of existing target HTTPS proxies. A
target HTTPS proxy is referenced by one or more forwarding rules which specify
the network traffic that the proxy is responsible for routing. The target HTTPS
proxy in turn points to a URL map that defines the rules for routing the
requests. The URL map's job is to map URLs to backend services which handle the
actual requests. The target HTTPS proxy also points to at most 15 SSL
certificates used for server\-side authentication. The target HTTPS proxy can be
associated with at most one SSL policy.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fINAME\fR
Name of the target HTTPS proxy to update.

.SH "FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-quic\-override\fR=\fIQUIC_OVERRIDE\fR
Controls whether load balancer may negotiate QUIC with clients. QUIC is a new
transport which reduces latency compared to that of TCP. See
https://www.chromium.org/quic for more details. \fIQUIC_OVERRIDE\fR must be one
of:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fBDISABLE\fR
Disallows load balancer to negotiate QUIC with clients.
.TP 2m
\fBENABLE\fR
Allows load balancer to negotiate QUIC with clients.
.TP 2m
\fBNONE\fR
Allows Google to control when QUIC is rolled out.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-ssl\-certificates\fR=\fISSL_CERTIFICATE\fR,[...]
References to at most 15 SSL certificate resources that are used for
server\-side authentication. The first SSL certificate in this list is
considered the primary SSL certificate associated with the load balancer. The
SSL certificates must exist and cannot be deleted while referenced by a target
HTTPS proxy.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-url\-map\fR=\fIURL_MAP\fR
A reference to a URL map resource. A URL map defines the mapping of URLs to
backend services. Before you can refer to a URL map, you must create the URL
map. To delete a URL map that a target proxy is referring to, you must first
delete the target HTTPS proxy.

.TP 2m

At most one of these may be specified:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-clear\-ssl\-policy\fR
Removes any attached SSL policy from the HTTPS proxy.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-ssl\-policy\fR=\fISSL_POLICY\fR
A reference to an SSL policy resource that defines the server\-side support for
SSL features and affects the connections between clients and the HTTPS proxy
load balancer. The SSL policy must exist and cannot be deleted while referenced
by a target HTTPS proxy.

.RE
.sp
.TP 2m

At most one of these may be specified:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-global\fR
If set, the target HTTPS proxy is global.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-region\fR=\fIREGION\fR
Region of the target HTTPS proxy to update. If not specified, you may be
prompted to select a region.

To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
\f5\fIcompute/region\fR\fR property:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config set compute/region REGION
.RE

A list of regions can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute regions list
.RE

To unset the property, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config unset compute/region
.RE

Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
\f5\fICLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION\fR\fR.

.RE
.sp
.TP 2m

At most one of these may be specified:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-global\-ssl\-certificates\fR
If set, the ssl certificates are global.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-ssl\-certificates\-region\fR=\fISSL_CERTIFICATES_REGION\fR
Region of the ssl certificates to operate on. If not specified, you may be
prompted to select a region.

To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
\f5\fIcompute/region\fR\fR property:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config set compute/region REGION
.RE

A list of regions can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute regions list
.RE

To unset the property, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config unset compute/region
.RE

Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
\f5\fICLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION\fR\fR.

\fB\-\-global\-url\-map\fR
If set, the URL map is global.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-url\-map\-region\fR=\fIURL_MAP_REGION\fR
Region of the URL map to operate on. Overrides the default \fBcompute/region\fR
property value for this command invocation.
