receiving a message before re\-attempting delivery.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-expiration\-period\fR=\fIEXPIRATION_PERIOD\fR
The subscription will expire if it is inactive for the given period. Valid
values are strings of the form INTEGER[UNIT], where UNIT is one of "s", "m",
"h", and "d" for seconds, minutes, hours, and days, respectively. If the unit is
omitted, seconds is assumed. This flag additionally accepts the special value
"never" to indicate that the subscription will never expire.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-message\-retention\-duration\fR=\fIMESSAGE_RETENTION_DURATION\fR
How long to retain unacknowledged messages in the subscription's backlog, from
the moment a message is published. If \-\-retain\-acked\-messages is true, this
also configures the retention of acknowledged messages. Specify "default" to use
the default value. Valid values are strings of the form INTEGER[UNIT], where
UNIT is one of "s", "m", "h", and "d" for seconds, minutes, hours, and days,
respectively. If the unit is omitted, seconds is assumed.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-push\-auth\-service\-account\fR=\fISERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL\fR

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-retain\-acked\-messages\fR
Whether or not to retain acknowledged messages. If true, messages are not

by default.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-update\-labels\fR=[\fIKEY\fR=\fIVALUE\fR,...]
List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to update. If a label exists its value is
modified, otherwise a new label is created.

Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens (\f5\-\fR),
underscores (\f5_\fR), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must contain
only hyphens (\f5\-\fR), underscores (\f5_\fR), lowercase characters, and
