\f5gcloud auth application\-default login\fR [\fB\-\-client\-id\-file\fR=\fICLIENT_ID_FILE\fR] [\fB\-\-no\-launch\-browser\fR] [\fB\-\-scopes\fR=\fISCOPES\fR,[\fISCOPES\fR,...]] [\fB\-\-no\-add\-quota\-project\fR\ |\ \fB\-\-disable\-quota\-project\fR] [\fIGCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG\ ...\fR]



.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Obtains user access credentials via a web flow and puts them in the well\-known
location for Application Default Credentials (ADC).

This command is useful when you are developing code that would normally use a
service account but need to run the code in a local development environment
where it's easier to provide user credentials. The credentials will apply to all
API calls that make use of the Application Default Credentials client library.
Do not set the \f5GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS\fR environment variable if you
want to use the credentials generated by this command in your local development.
This command tries to find a quota project from gcloud's context and write it to
ADC so that Google client libraries can use it for billing and quota.
Alternatively, you can use the \f5\-\-client\-id\-file\fR flag. In this case,
the project owning the client id will be used for billing and quota. You can
create the client\-id\-file at
https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials.

This command has no effect on the user account(s) set up by the \f5gcloud auth
login\fR command.

Any credentials previously generated by \f5gcloud auth application\-default
login\fR will be overwritten.



.SH "FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-client\-id\-file\fR=\fICLIENT_ID_FILE\fR
A file containing your own client id to use to login. If \-\-client\-id\-file is
specified, the quota project will not be written to ADC.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-launch\-browser\fR
Launch a browser for authorization. If not enabled or DISPLAY variable is not
set, prints a URL to standard output to be copied. Enabled by default, use
\fB\-\-no\-launch\-browser\fR to disable.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-scopes\fR=\fISCOPES\fR,[\fISCOPES\fR,...]
The names of the scopes to authorize for. By default openid,
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email,
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud\-platform scopes are used. The list of
possible scopes can be found at:
https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/googlescopes.

.TP 2m

At most one of these may be specified:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-add\-quota\-project\fR
(DEPRECATED) Read the project from the context of the gcloud command\-line tool
and write it to application default credentials as the quota project. It is the
default behavior.

The \-\-add\-quota\-project flag is deprecated. Enabled by default, use
\fB\-\-no\-add\-quota\-project\fR to disable.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-disable\-quota\-project\fR
By default, the project in billing/quota_project or core/project will be written
to application default credentials (ADC) as the quota project. When both are
set, billing/quota_project takes precedence. You can use \-\-billing\-project to
overwrite the value in billing/quota_project. Similarly, you can use \-\-project
to overwrite the value in core/project. Client libraries will send it to
services and use it for quota and billing. To be able to use a project as the
quota project, the account in ADC must have the serviceusage.services.use
permission on the project. This permission is granted to the project editor and
project owner. You can create custom roles to include this permission.

Note that some cloud services may ignore this quota project and still bill the
project owning the resources.

In the following situations, you may use this flag to skip setting the quota
project:

.RS 2m
.IP "\(bu" 2m
The account in ADC cannot be granted the project editor or owner role or any
role with the serviceusage.services.use permission.
.IP "\(bu" 2m
You always want to bill the project owning the resources.
