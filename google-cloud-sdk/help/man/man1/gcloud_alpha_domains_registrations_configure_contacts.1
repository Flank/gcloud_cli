\fB\-\-contact\-data\-from\-file\fR=\fICONTACT_DATA_FILE_NAME\fR
A YAML file containing the contact data for the domain's three contacts:
registrant, admin, and technical.

The file can either specify a single set of contact data with label
\'allContacts', or three separate sets of contact data with labels
\'adminContact' and 'technicalContact'.

If 'registrantContact', 'adminContact' or 'technicalContact' labels are used
then only the specified contacts are updated.

Each contact data must contain values for all required fields: email,
phoneNumber and postalAddress in google.type.PostalAddress format.

For more guidance on how to specify postalAddress, please see:
