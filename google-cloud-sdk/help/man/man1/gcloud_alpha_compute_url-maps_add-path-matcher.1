.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR \fBgcloud alpha compute url\-maps add\-path\-matcher\fR is used to
add a path matcher to a URL map. A path matcher maps HTTP request paths to
backend services or backend buckets. Each path matcher must be referenced by at
least one host rule. This command can create a new host rule through the
\f5\-\-new\-hosts\fR flag or it can reconfigure an existing host rule to point
to the newly added path matcher using \f5\-\-existing\-host\fR. In the latter
case, if a path matcher is orphaned as a result of the operation, this command
will fail unless \f5\-\-delete\-orphaned\-path\-matcher\fR is provided.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fIURL_MAP\fR
Name of the URL map to operate on.

.SH "REQUIRED FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-path\-matcher\-name\fR=\fIPATH_MATCHER_NAME\fR
The name to assign to the path matcher.

.TP 2m

Exactly one of these must be specified:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-default\-backend\-bucket\fR=\fIDEFAULT_BACKEND_BUCKET\fR
A backend bucket that will be used for requests that the path matcher cannot
match. Exactly one of \-\-default\-service or \-\-default\-backend\-bucket is
required.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-default\-service\fR=\fIDEFAULT_SERVICE\fR
A backend service that will be used for requests that the path matcher cannot
match. Exactly one of \-\-default\-service or \-\-default\-backend\-bucket is
required.

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-backend\-bucket\-path\-rules\fR=\fIPATH\fR=\fIBUCKET\fR,[\fIPATH\fR=\fIBUCKET\fR,...]
Rules for mapping request paths to backend buckets.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-backend\-service\-path\-rules\fR=\fIPATH\fR=\fISERVICE\fR,[...]
Rules for mapping request paths to services.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-delete\-orphaned\-path\-matcher\fR
If provided and a path matcher is orphaned as a result of this command, the
command removes the orphaned path matcher instead of failing.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-description\fR=\fIDESCRIPTION\fR
An optional, textual description for the path matcher.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-path\-rules\fR=\fIPATH\fR=\fISERVICE\fR,[...]
Rules for mapping request paths to services.

.TP 2m

At most one of these may be specified:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-existing\-host\fR=\fIEXISTING_HOST\fR
An existing host rule to tie the new path matcher to. Although host rules can
contain more than one host, only a single host is needed to uniquely identify
the host rule.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-new\-hosts\fR=\fINEW_HOST\fR,[\fINEW_HOST\fR,...]
If specified, a new host rule with the given hosts is created and the path
matcher is tied to the new host rule.

.RE

.TP 2m

At most one of these may be specified:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-global\fR
If set, the URL map is global.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-region\fR=\fIREGION\fR
Region of the URL map to operate on. If not specified, you may be prompted to
select a region.

To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
\f5\fIcompute/region\fR\fR property:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config set compute/region REGION
.RE

A list of regions can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute regions list
.RE

To unset the property, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config unset compute/region
.RE

Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
\f5\fICLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION\fR\fR.

.SH "EXAMPLES"

To create a rule for mapping the path \f5/search/*\fR to the hypothetical
\f5search\-service\fR, \f5/static/*\fR to the \f5static\-bucket\fR backend
bucket and \f5/images/*\fR to the \f5images\-service\fR under the hosts
\f5example.com\fR and \f5*.example.com\fR, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha compute url\-maps add\-path\-matcher MY\-URL\-MAP \e
    \-\-path\-matcher\-name=MY\-MATCHER \e
    \-\-default\-service=MY\-DEFAULT\-SERVICE \e

=images\-service' \e
    \-\-backend\-bucket\-path\-rules='/static/*=static\-bucket' \e
    \-\-new\-hosts=example.com '*.example.com'
.RE

Note that a default service or default backend bucket must be provided to handle
paths for which there is no mapping.

command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right project,
you may be trying to access an API with an invitation\-only early access
