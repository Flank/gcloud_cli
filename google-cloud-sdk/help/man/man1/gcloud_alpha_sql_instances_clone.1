.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR \fBgcloud alpha sql instances clone\fR creates a clone of the
Cloud SQL instance. The source and the destination instances must be in the same
project. The clone once created will be an independent Cloud SQL instance.

The binary log coordinates, if specified, act as the point up to which the
source instance is cloned. If not specified, the source instance is cloned up to
the most recent binary log coordinates at the time the command is executed.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fISOURCE\fR
Cloud SQL instance ID of the source.

.TP 2m
\fIDESTINATION\fR
Cloud SQL instance ID of the clone.

\fB\-\-async\fR
Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to complete.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-bin\-log\-file\-name\fR=\fIBIN_LOG_FILE_NAME\fR
Represents the name of the binary log file created by the source instance if it
has binary logs enabled. If specified, is the point up to which the source
instance is cloned. It must be specified along with \-\-bin\-log\-position to
form a valid binary log coordinates. e.g., mysql\-bin.000001

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-bin\-log\-position\fR=\fIBIN_LOG_POSITION\fR
Represents the position (offset) inside the binary log file created by the
source instance if it has binary logs enabled. If specified, is the point up to
which the source instance is cloned. It must be specified along with
\-\-bin\-log\-file to form a valid binary log coordinates. e.g., 123 (a numeric
value)

.SH "EXAMPLES"

To clone a source instance to the most recent binary log coordinates:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha sql instances clone instance\-foo instance\-bar
.RE

or to clone at specific binary log coordinates:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha sql instances clone instance\-foo instance\-bar \e
    \-\-bin\-log\-file\-name mysql\-bin.000020 \-\-bin\-log\-position 170

.SH "NOTES"

This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right project,
you may be trying to access an API with an invitation\-only early access
whitelist. These variants are also available:
