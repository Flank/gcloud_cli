.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR \fBgcloud alpha compute target\-vpn\-gateways create\fR is used to
create a Cloud VPN Classic Target VPN Gateway. A Target VPN Gateway can
reference one or more VPN tunnels that connect it to the remote tunnel endpoint.
A Target VPN Gateway may also be referenced by one or more forwarding rules that
define which packets the gateway is responsible for routing.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

\fB\-\-description\fR=\fIDESCRIPTION\fR
An optional, textual description for the target VPN Gateway.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-region\fR=\fIREGION\fR
Region of the Target VPN Gateway to create. If not specified, you may be
prompted to select a region.

To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
\f5\fIcompute/region\fR\fR property:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config set compute/region REGION
.RE

A list of regions can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute regions list
.RE

To unset the property, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config unset compute/region
.RE

Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
\f5\fICLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION\fR\fR.
