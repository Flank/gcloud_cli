.SH "NAME"
.HP
gcloud alpha container hub memberships unregister \- unregister a cluster from Hub



.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP
\f5gcloud alpha container hub memberships unregister\fR \fICLUSTER_NAME\fR (\fB\-\-gke\-cluster\fR=\fILOCATION\fR/\fICLUSTER_NAME\fR\ |\ \fB\-\-gke\-uri\fR=\fIGKE_URI\fR\ |\ [\fB\-\-context\fR=\fICONTEXT\fR\ :\ \fB\-\-kubeconfig\fR=\fIKUBECONFIG\fR]) [\fIGCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG\ ...\fR]



.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR This command unregisters a cluster with the Hub by:

.RS 2m
1. Deleting the Hub Membership resource for this cluster (a.k.a
   `gcloud alpha container hub memberships delete`).
2. Removing the corresponding in\-cluster Kubernetes Resources that make the
   cluster exclusive to one Hub (a.k.a `kubectl delete memberships
   membership`).
3. Uninstalling the Connect Agent from this cluster (a.k.a
   `kubectl delete on the gke\-connect namespace`).
.RE

The unregister command makes additional internal checks to ensure that all three
steps can be safely done to properly clean\-up in\-Hub and in\-cluster
resources.

To register a non\-GKE cluster use \-\-context flag (with an optional
\-\-kubeconfig flag).

To register a GKE cluster use \-\-gke\-cluster or \-\-gke\-uri flag (no
\-\-kubeconfig flag is required).

To only delete the Hub membership resource, consider using the command:
\f5gcloud alpha container hub memberships delete\fR. This command is intended to
delete stale Hub Membership resources as doing so on a fully registered cluster
will skip some of the steps above and orphan in\-cluster resources and agent
connections to Google.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fICLUSTER_NAME\fR
The membership name that corresponds to the cluster being unregistered. To get
list of all the memberships on the Hub, consider using the command: \f5gcloud
alpha container hub memberships list\fR.

.SH "REQUIRED FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m

Cluster identifier. Exactly one of these must be specified:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-gke\-cluster\fR=\fILOCATION\fR/\fICLUSTER_NAME\fR
The location/name of the GKE cluster. The location can be a zone or a region for
e.g \f5us\-central1\-a/my\-cluster\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-gke\-uri\fR=\fIGKE_URI\fR
The URI of the GKE cluster; for example,
\'https://container.googleapis.com/projects/my\-project/locations/us\-central1\-a/clusters/my\-cluster'
The URI can obtain by calling: gcloud container clusters list \-\-uri This is
only valid if the represented cluster is a GKE cluster. The provided URI will be
validated to confirm that it maps to the valid GKE cluster.

.TP 2m

Non\-GKE cluster identifier.

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-context\fR=\fICONTEXT\fR
The cluster context as it appears in the kubeconfig file. You can get this value
from the command line by running command: \f5kubectl config current\-context\fR.
This flag must be specified if any of the other arguments in this group are
specified.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-kubeconfig\fR=\fIKUBECONFIG\fR
The kubeconfig file containing an entry for the cluster. Defaults to $KUBECONFIG
if it is set in the environment, otherwise defaults to $HOME/.kube/config.

.SH "EXAMPLES"

Unregister a non\-GKE cluster referenced from a specific kubeconfig file:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha container hub memberships unregister my\-cluster \e
  \-\-context=my\-cluster\-context \e
  \-\-kubeconfig=/home/user/custom_kubeconfig
.RE

Unregister a non\-GKE cluster referenced from the default kubeconfig file:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha container hub memberships unregister my\-cluster \e
    \-\-context=my\-cluster\-context
.RE

Unregister a GKE cluster referenced from a GKE URI:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha container hub memberships unregister my\-cluster \e
  \-\-gke\-uri=my\-cluster\-gke\-uri
.RE

Unregister a GKE cluster referenced from a GKE Cluster location and name:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha container hub memberships unregister my\-cluster \e
  \-\-gke\-cluster=my\-cluster\-region\-or\-zone/my\-cluster

.SH "NOTES"

This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right project,
you may be trying to access an API with an invitation\-only early access
allowlist. These variants are also available:

.RS 2m
