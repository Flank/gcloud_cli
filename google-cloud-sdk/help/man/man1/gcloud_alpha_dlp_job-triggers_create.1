.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR Creates a Cloud DLP job trigger.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m

Job trigger resource \- The Cloud DLP job trigger to create. The job trigger
name can contain uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens \-\- that
is, it must match the regular expression:\f5[a\-zA\-Z\e\ed\-]+\fR. The maximum
length is 100 characters. If not supplied, the system generates one. This
represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in
this group but can be set in other ways. To set the [project] attribute: provide
the argument [job_trigger] on the command line with a fully specified name;
provide the argument [\-\-project] on the command line; set the property
[core/project]. This must be specified.


.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fIJOB_TRIGGER\fR
ID of the job_trigger or fully qualified identifier for the job_trigger.

.SH "REQUIRED FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-trigger\-schedule\fR=\fITRIGGER_SCHEDULE\fR
Duration specifying how often the triggered job will be run. A scheduled start
time will be skipped if the previous execution has not ended when its scheduled
time occurs. Value must be a time duration greater than or equal to 1 day and
can be no longer than 60 days.

See \f5$ gcloud topic datetimes for information on duration formats.\fR

.TP 2m

Exactly one of these must be specified:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-datastore\-kind\fR=\fIDATASTORE_KIND\fR
The Cloud Datastore kind or table to scan. The kind can optionally be prefixed
with the Cloud Datastore namespace ID \- for example
\f5namespace:example\-kind\fR or simply \f5example\-kind\fR

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-input\-table\fR=\fIINPUT_TABLE\fR
BigQuery table to scan. BigQuery tables are uniquely identified by their
project_id, dataset_id, and table_id in the format
\f5<project_id>.<dataset_id>.<table_id>\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-path\fR=\fIPATH\fR
Google Cloud Storage URL to scan for files with optional wildcard character
(\f5*\fR) \-\- for example, gs://my\-bucket/\f5*\fR.

.RE

.TP 2m

Exactly one of these must be specified:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-output\-table\fR=[\fIOUTPUT_TABLE\fR,...]
Publishes results of a Cloud DLP job a BigQuery table. BigQuery tables are
uniquely identified by their project_id, dataset_id, and table_id in the format
\f5<project_id>.<dataset_id>.<table_id>\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-output\-topics\fR=[\fIOUTPUT_TOPICS\fR,...]
Publishes the results of a Cloud DLP job to one or more Cloud Pub/Sub topics.

Note: The topic must have given publishing access rights to the DLP API service
account executing the Cloud DLP job.

.SH "OPTIONAL FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-description\fR=\fIDESCRIPTION\fR
User provided description (maximum 256 characters)

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-display\-name\fR=\fIDISPLAY_NAME\fR
Display name of the job trigger (maximum 100 characters)

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-exclude\-info\-types\fR
Whether or not to exclude type information of the findings. Type information is
included by default.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-include\-quote\fR
If True, a contextual quote from the data that triggered a finding is included
in the response. Even if the content is not text, it may be converted to a
textual representation in the response. For example, given the input value 'My
phone number is (415) 555\-0890' and a search for the infoType PHONE_NUMBER, the
contextual quote would be '(415) 555\-0890.'

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-info\-types\fR=[\fIINFOTYPE\fR,...]
Which infoTypes to scan input for. The values must correspond to infoType values
found in documentation. For more information about valid infoTypes, see
infoTypes Reference (https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/infotypes\-reference)

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-max\-findings\fR=\fIMAX_FINDINGS\fR
Maximum number of findings that will be returned per execution.

If not specified, no limits are applied.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-max\-findings\-per\-item\fR=\fIMAX_FINDINGS_PER_ITEM\fR
Maximum number of findings that will be returned for each item scanned.

If not specified, no limits are applied.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-min\-likelihood\fR=\fIMIN_LIKELIHOOD\fR; default="possible"
Only return findings equal to or above this threshold. \fIMIN_LIKELIHOOD\fR must
be one of: \fBlikely\fR, \fBpossible\fR, \fBunlikely\fR, \fBvery\-likely\fR,
\fBvery\-unlikely\fR.
