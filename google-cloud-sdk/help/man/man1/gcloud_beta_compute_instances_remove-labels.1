gcloud beta compute instances remove\-labels \- remove labels from Google Compute Engine virtual machine instances



.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP
\f5gcloud beta compute instances remove\-labels\fR \fIINSTANCE_NAME\fR (\fB\-\-all\fR\ |\ \fB\-\-labels\fR=\fIKEY\fR,[\fIKEY\fR,...]) [\fB\-\-zone\fR=\fIZONE\fR] [\fIGCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG\ ...\fR]



.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(BETA)\fR \fBgcloud beta compute instances remove\-labels\fR removes labels
from a Google Compute Engine virtual machine instance. For example, running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud beta compute instances remove\-labels example\-instance \e
    \-\-labels=k0,k1
.RE

will remove existing labels with key \f5\fIk0\fR\fR and \f5\fIk1\fR\fR from
\'example\-instance'.

Labels can be used to identify the instance and to filter them as in

.RS 2m
$ gcloud beta compute instances list \-\-filter='labels.k1:value2'
.RE

To list existing labels

.RS 2m
$ gcloud beta compute instances describe example\-instance \e
    \-\-format='default(labels)'
.RE



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fIINSTANCE_NAME\fR
Name of the instance to operate on.

.SH "REQUIRED FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m

Exactly one of these must be specified:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-all\fR
Remove all labels from the resource.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-labels\fR=\fIKEY\fR,[\fIKEY\fR,...]
A comma\-separated list of label keys to remove from the resource.

.SH "OPTIONAL FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-zone\fR=\fIZONE\fR
Zone of the instance to operate on. If not specified, you may be prompted to
select a zone. \f5gcloud\fR will attempt to identify the zone by searching for
resources in your project. If the zone cannot be determined, you will then be
prompted with all Google Cloud Platform zones.

To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
\f5\fIcompute/zone\fR\fR property:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE
.RE

A list of zones can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute zones list
.RE

To unset the property, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config unset compute/zone
.RE

Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
\f5\fICLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE\fR\fR.
