gcloud alpha container clusters get\-credentials \- fetch credentials for a running cluster



.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP
\f5gcloud alpha container clusters get\-credentials\fR \fINAME\fR [\fB\-\-internal\-ip\fR] [\fB\-\-region\fR=\fIREGION\fR\ |\ \fB\-\-zone\fR=\fIZONE\fR,\ \fB\-z\fR\ \fIZONE\fR] [\fIGCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG\ ...\fR]



.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR gcloud alpha container clusters get\-credentials updates a
\f5kubeconfig\fR file with appropriate credentials and endpoint information to
point \f5kubectl\fR at a specific cluster in Google Kubernetes Engine.

It takes a project and a zone as parameters, passed through by set defaults or
flags. By default, credentials are written to \f5HOME/.kube/config\fR. You can
provide an alternate path by setting the \f5KUBECONFIG\fR environment variable.
If \f5KUBECONFIG\fR contains multiple paths, the first one is used.

This command enables switching to a specific cluster, when working with multiple
clusters. It can also be used to access a previously created cluster from a new
workstation.

By default, gcloud alpha container clusters get\-credentials will configure
kubectl to automatically refresh its credentials using the same identity as
gcloud. If you are running kubectl as part of an application, it is recommended
to use application default credentials
(https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production). To configure a
\f5kubeconfig\fR file to use application default credentials, set the
container/use_application_default_credentials Cloud SDK property
(https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/properties) to true before running gcloud
alpha container clusters get\-credentials

See https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes\-engine/docs/kubectl for kubectl
documentation.
