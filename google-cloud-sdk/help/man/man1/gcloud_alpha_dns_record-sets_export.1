.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR This command exports the record\-sets contained within the
specified managed\-zone into a file. The formats you can export to are YAML
records format (default) and BIND zone file format.

.SH "OPTIONAL FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-zone\-file\-format\fR
Indicates that records\-file should be in the zone file format. When using this
flag, expect the record\-set to be exported to a BIND zone formatted file. If
you omit this flag, the record\-set is exported into a YAML formatted records
file. Note, this format flag determines the format of the output recorded in the
records\-file; it is different from the global \f5\-\-format\fR flag which
affects console output alone.
