.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR Cloud Composer is a managed Apache Airflow service that helps you
create, schedule, monitor and manage workflows. Cloud Composer automation helps
you create Airflow environments quickly and use Airflow\-native tools, such as
the powerful Airflow web interface and command line tools, so you can focus on
your workflows and not your infrastructure.
