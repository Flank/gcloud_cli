.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR \fBgcloud alpha compute url\-maps remove\-host\-rule\fR is used to
remove a host rule from a URL map. When a host rule is removed, its path matcher
is only removed if it is not referenced by any other host rules and
\f5\-\-delete\-orphaned\-path\-matcher\fR is provided.

.SH "OPTIONAL FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-delete\-orphaned\-path\-matcher\fR
If provided and a path matcher is orphaned as a result of this command, the
command removes the orphaned path matcher instead of failing.

.TP 2m

At most one of these may be specified:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-global\fR
If set, the URL map is global.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-region\fR=\fIREGION\fR
Region of the URL map to operate on. If not specified, you may be prompted to
select a region.

To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
\f5\fIcompute/region\fR\fR property:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config set compute/region REGION
.RE

A list of regions can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute regions list
.RE

To unset the property, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config unset compute/region
.RE

Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
\f5\fICLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION\fR\fR.
