.SH "OPTIONAL FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-auto\-expand\fR
Whether or not the entity type can be automatically expanded to idenitify
entities not explicitly included.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-entities\fR=\fIENTITIES\fR
Comma separated list of entities, or a map of entities to synonyms.

If a list, the entities can contain references to other entity types (with or
without aliases).

To specify a map, set this flag with \f5\-\-flags\-file\fR as a map, where each
key is the canonical name and each value is a list of synonyms to map to the
canonical name. The canonical name must be explicitly included in the list of
synonyms. For more information on \f5\-\-flags\-file\fR, see \f5gcloud topics
flags\-file\fR.

For example, use \f5\-\-flags\-file=flags.yaml\fR, where \f5flags.yaml\fR
contains:

.RS 2m
\-\-entities:
  red:
  \- red
  \- cherry
  \- rose
  blue:
  \- blue
  \- azure
  \- cyan
