.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR \fBgcloud alpha compute instance\-groups managed
set\-autoscaling\fR sets autoscaling parameters of specified managed instance
group.

Autoscalers can use one or more policies listed below. Information on using
multiple policies can be found here:
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/autoscaler/multiple\-policies



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fINAME\fR
Name of the managed instance group to operate on.


.RE
.sp

.SH "FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-autoscaling\-file\fR=\fIPATH\fR
Path of the file from which autoscaling configuration will be loaded. This flag
allows you to atomically setup complex autoscalers.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-cool\-down\-period\fR=\fICOOL_DOWN_PERIOD\fR
The time period that the autoscaler should wait before it starts collecting
information from a new instance. This prevents the autoscaler from collecting
information when the instance is initializing, during which the collected usage
would not be reliable. The default is 60s. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for
information on duration formats.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-cpu\-utilization\-predictive\-method\fR=\fICPU_UTILIZATION_PREDICTIVE_METHOD\fR
Indicates which method of prediction is used for CPU utilization metric, if any.
\fICPU_UTILIZATION_PREDICTIVE_METHOD\fR must be one of:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fBnone\fR
(Default) No predictions are made based on the scaling metric when calculating
the number of VM instances.
.TP 2m
\fBoptimize\-availability\fR
Predictive autoscaling predicts the future values of the scaling metric and
scales a MIG in advance to ensure that new VM instances are ready in time to
cover the predicted peak.
.TP 2m
\fBstandard\fR
Standard predictive autoscaling predicts the future values of the scaling metric
and then scales a MIG to ensure that new VM instances are ready in time to cover
the predicted peak.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-custom\-metric\-utilization\fR=[\fImetric\fR=\fIMETRIC\fR],[\fIutilization\-target\fR=\fIUTILIZATION\-TARGET\fR],[\fIutilization\-target\-type\fR=\fIUTILIZATION\-TARGET\-TYPE\fR]
Adds a target metric value for the Autoscaler to use.

.TP 2m
\fBmetric\fR
Protocol\-free URL of a Google Cloud Monitoring metric.

.TP 2m
\fButilization\-target\fR
Value of the metric Autoscaler will aim to maintain (greater than 0.0).

.TP 2m
\fButilization\-target\-type\fR
How target is expressed. Valid values: DELTA_PER_MINUTE, DELTA_PER_SECOND,
GAUGE.

Mutually exclusive with \f5\-\-update\-stackdriver\-metric\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-mode\fR=\fIMODE\fR
Set the mode of an autoscaler for a managed instance group.

You can turn off or restrict MIG autoscaler activities without affecting your
autoscaler configuration. The autoscaler configuration persists while the
activities are turned off or restricted, and the activities resume when the
autoscaler is turned on again or when the restrictions are lifted.

\fIMODE\fR must be one of:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fBoff\fR
Turns off autoscaling, while keeping the new configuration.
.TP 2m
\fBon\fR

.TP 2m
\fBonly\-scale\-out\fR
Permits autoscaling to scale only out and not in.
.TP 2m
\fBonly\-up\fR
(DEPRECATED) Permits autoscaling to scale only out and not in.

Value `only\-up` is deprecated. Use `\-\-mode only\-scale\-out`
instead.

the only input used for autoscaling the command will fail.

an abrupt scale in of a managed instance group, it will be throttled as
specified by the parameters.

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fBmax\-scaled\-in\-replicas\fR
Maximum allowed number of VMs that can be deducted from the peak recommendation
during the window. Possibly all these VMs can be deleted at once so the

.TP 2m
\fBmax\-scaled\-in\-replicas\-percent\fR

autoscaler will not resize below the maximum allowed deduction subtracted from
the peak size observed in this period. Measured in seconds.

\f5\-\-custom\-metric\-utilization\fR. \fITARGET_TYPE\fR must be one of:
\fBdelta\-per\-minute\fR, \fBdelta\-per\-second\fR, \fBgauge\fR.

.TP 2m

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-target\-load\-balancing\-utilization\fR=\fITARGET_LOAD_BALANCING_UTILIZATION\fR

\f5\-\-stackdriver\-metric\-utilization\-target\-type\fR. Mutually exclusive
with \f5\-\-custom\-metric\-utilization\fR.

.TP 2m

At most one of these may be specified:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-region\fR=\fIREGION\fR
Region of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified, you may be
prompted to select a region.

A list of regions can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute regions list
.RE

Overrides the default \fBcompute/region\fR property value for this command
invocation.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-zone\fR=\fIZONE\fR
Zone of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified, you may be
prompted to select a zone.

A list of zones can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute zones list
.RE

Overrides the default \fBcompute/zone\fR property value for this command
invocation.

.RE
.sp
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-schedule\-cron\fR=\fISCHEDULE_CRON\fR
Start time of the scaling schedule in cron format.

This is when an autoscaler will start creating new VMs if MIG size is lower than
the minimum number of instances. Set the start time to allow enough time for new
VMs to boot and initialize. For example if your workload takes 10 minutes from
VM creation to start serving then set start time 10 minutes earlier than the
time you need VMs to be ready.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-schedule\-description\fR=\fISCHEDULE_DESCRIPTION\fR
A verbose description of the scaling schedule.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-schedule\-duration\-sec\fR=\fISCHEDULE_DURATION_SEC\fR
How long should the scaling schedule be active, measured in seconds.

Minimum duration is 5 minutes. Scaling schedule is active from its start time
and for configured duration. During this time autoscaler will scale MIG to have
at least as many VMs as defined by the minimum number of instances. After
specified duration if there is no need to maintain capacity, the autoscaler will
start removing instances after a 10 minutes stabilization period and (if
configured) following scale\-in controls.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-schedule\-min\-required\-replicas\fR=\fISCHEDULE_MIN_REQUIRED_REPLICAS\fR
How many VMs autoscaler should ensure for the duration of this scaling schedule.

Autoscaler will provide at least this number of instances when the scaling
schedule is active. MIG can have more VMs if there are other scaling schedules
active with higher instance count or if autoscaling policy (for example on CPU)
requires more instances to meet its target.

This configuration does not change autoscaling minimum and maximum instance
limits which are always in effect. Autoscaler will not create more than the
maximum number of instances configured for MIG.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-schedule\-time\-zone\fR=\fISCHEDULE_TIME_ZONE\fR
Location of the scaling schedule's start time.

It should be provided provided as a location from the IANA tz database (for
example Europe/Paris). It will consider daylight saving time (DST) adjustments.
If no time zone is provided UTC is used as a default.

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones for the list of
valid timezones.
