A string for filtering operations. The following filter fields are supported:

.RE

Example:

.RS 2m
'createTime >= 1432140000 AND
 createTime <= 1432150000 AND
 labels.batch = test AND
 status = RUNNING'
.RE

To calculate the timestamp as seconds from the epoch, on UNIX\-like systems
(e.g.: Linux, Mac) use the 'date' command:

.RS 2m
$ date \-\-date '20150701' '+%s'
.RE

.RE

or with Python (e.g.: Linux, Mac, Windows):

.RS 2m
$ python \e
    \-c \e
    'from time import mktime, strptime; print
 int(mktime(strptime("01 July 2015", "%d %B %Y")))'
