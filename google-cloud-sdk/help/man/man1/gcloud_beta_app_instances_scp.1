.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(BETA)\fR \fBgcloud beta app instances scp\fR lets you remotely copy files to
or from an App Engine Flexible instance.

\fBgcloud beta app instances scp\fR resolves the instance's IP address and
pre\-populates the VM with a public key managed by gcloud. If the gcloud managed
key pair does not exist, it is generated the first time an SSH command is run,
which may prompt you for a passphrase for the private key encryption.

All SSH commands require the OpenSSH client suite to be installed on Linux and
Mac OS X. On Windows, the Cloud SDK comes with a bundled PuTTY suite instead, so
it has no external dependencies.
