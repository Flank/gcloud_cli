gcloud alpha compute instances get\-serial\-port\-output \- read output from a virtual machine instance's serial port

\f5gcloud alpha compute instances get\-serial\-port\-output\fR \fIINSTANCE_NAME\fR [\fB\-\-port\fR=\fIPORT\fR] [\fB\-\-start\fR=\fISTART\fR] [\fB\-\-zone\fR=\fIZONE\fR] [\fIGCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG\ ...\fR]



.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR gcloud alpha compute instances get\-serial\-port\-output is used
to get the output from a Compute Engine virtual machine's serial port. The
serial port output from the virtual machine will be printed to standard output.
This information can be useful for diagnostic purposes.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fIINSTANCE_NAME\fR
Name of the instance to operate on. For details on valid instance names, refer
to the criteria documented under the field 'name' at:
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances

.SH "FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-port\fR=\fIPORT\fR
Instances can support up to four serial port outputs, numbered 1 through 4. By
default, this command will return the output of the first serial port. Setting
this flag will return the output of the requested serial port.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-start\fR=\fISTART\fR
Specifies the byte index (zero\-based) of the first byte you want returned. Use
this flag if you want to continue getting the output from a previous request
that was too long to return in one attempt. The last byte returned in a request
will be reported on STDERR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-zone\fR=\fIZONE\fR
Zone of the instance to operate on. If not specified, the user may be prompted
to select a zone. \f5gcloud\fR will attempt to identify the zone by searching
for resources in the user's project. If the zone cannot be determined, the user
will then be prompted with all Google Cloud Platform zones.

To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, the user can set the
\f5\fIcompute/zone\fR\fR property:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE
.RE

A list of zones can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute zones list
.RE

To unset the property, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config unset compute/zone
.RE

Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
\f5\fICLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE\fR\fR.

This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right project,
you may be trying to access an API with an invitation\-only early access
