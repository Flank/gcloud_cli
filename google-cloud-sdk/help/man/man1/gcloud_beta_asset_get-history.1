.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(BETA)\fR Get the update history of assets that overlaps a time window.



.SH "REQUIRED FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-asset\-names\fR=[\fIASSET_NAMES\fR,...]
A list of full names of the assets to get the history for. For more information,
see: https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names#full_resource_name

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-content\-type\fR=\fICONTENT_TYPE\fR
Asset content type. Specifying \f5resource\fR will export resource metadata,
specifying \f5iam\-policy\fR will export the IAM policy for each child asset,
specifying \f5org\-policy\fR will export the Org Policy set on child assets, and
specifying \f5access\-policy\fR will export the Access Policy set on child
assets. \fICONTENT_TYPE\fR must be one of: \fBresource\fR, \fBiam\-policy\fR,
\fBorg\-policy\fR, \fBaccess\-policy\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-start\-time\fR=\fISTART_TIME\fR
Start time of the time window (inclusive) for the asset history. Must be after
the current time minus 35 days. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on
time formats.

.TP 2m

Exactly one of these must be specified:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-organization\fR=\fIORGANIZATION_ID\fR
The ID of the organization which is the root asset.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-project\fR=\fIPROJECT_ID\fR
The project which is the root asset.

The Google Cloud Platform project ID to use for this invocation. If omitted,
then the current project is assumed; the current project can be listed using
\f5gcloud config list \-\-format='text(core.project)'\fR and can be set using
\f5gcloud config set project PROJECTID\fR.

\f5\-\-project\fR and its fallback \f5core/project\fR property play two roles in
the invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate on. It also
specifies the project for API enablement check, quota, and billing. To specify a
different project for quota and billing, use \f5\-\-billing\-project\fR or
\f5billing/quota_project\fR property.

.SH "OPTIONAL FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-end\-time\fR=\fIEND_TIME\fR
End time of the time window (exclusive) for the asset history. Defaults to
current time if not specified. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on
time formats.
