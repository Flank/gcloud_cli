gcloud alpha compute target\-pools set\-backup \- set a backup pool for a target pool



.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP
\f5gcloud alpha compute target\-pools set\-backup\fR \fINAME\fR (\fB\-\-backup\-pool\fR=\fIBACKUP_POOL\fR\ |\ \fB\-\-no\-backup\-pool\fR) [\fB\-\-failover\-ratio\fR=\fIFAILOVER_RATIO\fR] [\fB\-\-region\fR=\fIREGION\fR] [\fIGCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG\ ...\fR]



.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR \fBgcloud alpha compute target\-pools set\-backup\fR is used to
set a backup target pool for a primary target pool, which defines the fallback
behavior of the primary pool. If the ratio of the healthy instances in the
primary pool is at or below the specified \f5\fI\-\-failover\-ratio value\fR\fR,
then traffic arriving at the load\-balanced IP address will be directed to the
backup pool.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fINAME\fR
The name of the target pool for which to set the backup pool.


.RE
.sp

.SH "REQUIRED FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m

Exactly one of these must be specified:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-backup\-pool\fR=\fIBACKUP_POOL\fR
Name of the target pool that will serve as backup.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-no\-backup\-pool\fR
Unsets the backup pool. This disables failover.


.RE
.RE
.sp

.SH "OPTIONAL FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-failover\-ratio\fR=\fIFAILOVER_RATIO\fR
The new failover ratio value for the target pool. This must be a float in the
range of [0, 1].

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-region\fR=\fIREGION\fR
Region of the target pool to set a backup pool for. If not specified, you may be
prompted to select a region.

To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
\f5\fIcompute/region\fR\fR property:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config set compute/region REGION
.RE

A list of regions can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute regions list
.RE

To unset the property, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config unset compute/region
.RE

Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
\f5\fICLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION\fR\fR.

These flags are available to all commands: \-\-account, \-\-billing\-project,
\-\-configuration, \-\-flags\-file, \-\-flatten, \-\-format, \-\-help,
\-\-impersonate\-service\-account, \-\-log\-http, \-\-project, \-\-quiet,

Run \fB$ gcloud help\fR for details.



.SH "EXAMPLES"

To cause \f5TARGET\-POOL\fR (in region \f5us\-central1\fR) to fail over to
\f5BACKUP\-POOL\fR when more than half of the \f5TARGET\-POOL\fR instances are
unhealthy, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha compute target\-pools set\-backup TARGET\-POOL \e
    \-\-backup\-pool=BACKUP\-POOL \-\-failover\-ratio=0.5 \e
    \-\-region=us\-central1
.RE

To remove \f5BACKUP\-POOL\fR as a backup to \f5TARGET\-POOL\fR, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha compute target\-pools set\-backup TARGET\-POOL \e
    \-\-backup\-pool='' \-\-region=us\-central1
.RE



.SH "NOTES"

This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right project,
you may be trying to access an API with an invitation\-only early access
allowlist. These variants are also available:

$ gcloud beta compute target\-pools set\-backup
