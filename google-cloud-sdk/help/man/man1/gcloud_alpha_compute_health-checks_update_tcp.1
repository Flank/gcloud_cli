.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR \fBgcloud alpha compute health\-checks update tcp\fR is used to
update an existing TCP health check. Only arguments passed in will be updated on
the health check. Other attributes will remain unaffected.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fINAME\fR
Name of the TCP health check to update.


.RE
.sp

.SH "FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-check\-interval\fR=\fICHECK_INTERVAL\fR
How often to perform a health check for an instance. For example, specifying
\f5\fI10s\fR\fR will run the check every 10 seconds. See $ gcloud topic
datetimes for information on duration formats.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-description\fR=\fIDESCRIPTION\fR
A textual description for the TCP health check. Pass in an empty string to
unset.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-enable\-logging\fR
Enable logging of health check probe results to Stackdriver. Logging is disabled
by default.

.RS 2m
Use \-\-no\-enable\-logging to disable logging.
.RE

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-healthy\-threshold\fR=\fIHEALTHY_THRESHOLD\fR
The number of consecutive successful health checks before an unhealthy instance
is marked as healthy.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-proxy\-header\fR=\fIPROXY_HEADER\fR
The type of proxy protocol header to be sent to the backend. \fIPROXY_HEADER\fR
must be one of:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fBNONE\fR
No proxy header is added.
.TP 2m
\fBPROXY_V1\fR
Adds the header "PROXY UNKNOWN\er\en".
.RE
.sp


.TP 2m
\fB\-\-request\fR=\fIREQUEST\fR
An optional string of up to 1024 characters to send once the health check TCP
connection has been established. The health checker then looks for a reply of
the string provided in the \f5\-\-response\fR field.

If \f5\-\-response\fR is not configured, the health checker does not wait for a
response and regards the probe as successful if the TCP or SSL handshake was
successful.

Setting this to an empty string will clear any existing request value.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-response\fR=\fIRESPONSE\fR
An optional string of up to 1024 characters that the health checker expects to
receive from the instance. If the response is not received exactly, the health
check probe fails. If \f5\-\-response\fR is configured, but not
\f5\-\-request\fR, the health checker will wait for a response anyway. Unless
your system automatically sends out a message in response to a successful
handshake, only configure \f5\-\-response\fR to match an explicit
\f5\-\-request\fR. Setting this to an empty string will clear any existing
response value.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-timeout\fR=\fITIMEOUT\fR
If Google Compute Engine doesn't receive a healthy response from the instance by
the time specified by the value of this flag, the health check request is
considered a failure. For example, specifying \f5\fI10s\fR\fR will cause the
check to wait for 10 seconds before considering the request a failure. See $
gcloud topic datetimes for information on duration formats.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-unhealthy\-threshold\fR=\fIUNHEALTHY_THRESHOLD\fR
The number of consecutive health check failures before a healthy instance is
marked as unhealthy.

.TP 2m

At most one of these may be specified:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-global\fR
If set, the TCP health check is global.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-region\fR=\fIREGION\fR
Region of the TCP health check to update. If not specified, you may be prompted
to select a region.

To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
\f5\fIcompute/region\fR\fR property:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config set compute/region REGION
.RE

A list of regions can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute regions list
.RE

To unset the property, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config unset compute/region
.RE

Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
\f5\fICLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION\fR\fR.

.RE
.sp
.TP 2m

These flags configure the port that the health check monitors. If both
\f5\-\-port\fR and \f5\-\-port\-name\fR are specified, \f5\-\-port\fR takes
precedence.

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-port\fR=\fIPORT\fR
The TCP port number that this health check monitors.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-port\-name\fR=\fIPORT_NAME\fR
The port name that this health check monitors. By default, this is empty.
Setting this to an empty string will clear any existing port\-name value.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-use\-serving\-port\fR
If given, use the "serving port" for health checks:

.RS 2m
.IP "\(bu" 2m
When health checking network endpoints in a Network Endpoint Group, use the port
specified with each endpoint. \f5\-\-use\-serving\-port\fR must be used when
using a Network Endpoint Group as a backend as this flag specifies the
\f5portSpecification\fR option for a Health Check object.
.IP "\(bu" 2m
When health checking other backends, use the port or named port of the backend
service.
