.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR This command starts a local Cloud Spanner emulator.



.SH "FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-host\-port\fR=\fIHOST_PORT\fR
The host:port to which the emulator should be bound. The default value is
localhost:9010. Note that this port serves gRPC requests. To override the
default port serving REST requests, use \-\-rest\-port. If using Docker to run
the emulator, the host must be specified as an ipaddress.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-rest\-port\fR=\fIREST_PORT\fR
The port at which REST requests are served. gcloud uses REST to communicate with
the emulator. The default value is 9020.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-use\-docker\fR=\fIUSE_DOCKER\fR
Use the cloud spanner emulator docker image even if the platform has a native
binary available in the sdk. Currently we only provide a native binary for
Linux. For other systems, you must install docker for your platform before
starting the emulator.
