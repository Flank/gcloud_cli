.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR Decrypts the given ciphertext file using the given CryptoKey and
writes the result to the named plaintext file.

If an additional authenticated data file is provided, its contents must match
the additional authenticated data provided during encryption. The file must not
be larger than 64KiB.

If \f5\-\-ciphertext\-file\fR or \f5\-\-additional\-authenticated\-data\-file\fR
is set to '\-', that file is read from stdin. Similarly, if
\f5\-\-plaintext\-file\fR is set to '\-', the decrypted plaintext is written to
stdout.



.SH "REQUIRED FLAGS"

Path to the ciphertext file to decrypt.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-plaintext\-file\fR=\fIPLAINTEXT_FILE\fR

.SH "EXAMPLES"

The following command will read the file 'path/to/ciphertext', decrypt it using
the CryptoKey \f5frodo\fR with the KeyRing \f5fellowship\fR and Location
\f5global\fR, and write the plaintext to 'path/to/plaintext'.
