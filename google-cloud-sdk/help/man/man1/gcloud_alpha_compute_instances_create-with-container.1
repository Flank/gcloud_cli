.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR \fBgcloud alpha compute instances create\-with\-container\fR
creates Compute Engine virtual machines that runs a Docker image. For example:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha compute instances create\-with\-container instance\-1 \e
    \-\-zone us\-central1\-a             \e
    \-\-container\-image=gcr.io/google\-containers/busybox
.RE

creates an instance called instance\-1, in the us\-central1\-a zone, running the
\'busybox' image.

For more examples, refer to the \fBEXAMPLES\fR section below.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fIINSTANCE_NAMES\fR [\fIINSTANCE_NAMES\fR ...]
Names of the instances to create. For details on valid instance names, refer to
the criteria documented under the field 'name' at:
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances


.RE
.sp

.SH "FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-accelerator\fR=[\fIcount\fR=\fICOUNT\fR],[\fItype\fR=\fITYPE\fR]
Attaches accelerators (e.g. GPUs) to the instances.

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fBtype\fR
The specific type (e.g. nvidia\-tesla\-k80 for nVidia Tesla K80) of accelerator
to attach to the instances. Use 'gcloud compute accelerator\-types list' to
learn about all available accelerator types.

.TP 2m
\fBcount\fR
Number of accelerators to attach to each instance. The default value is 1.

.RE
.sp
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-boot\-disk\-auto\-delete\fR
Automatically delete boot disks when their instances are deleted. Enabled by
default, use \fB\-\-no\-boot\-disk\-auto\-delete\fR to disable.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-boot\-disk\-device\-name\fR=\fIBOOT_DISK_DEVICE_NAME\fR
The name the guest operating system will see for the boot disk. This option can
only be specified if a new boot disk is being created (as opposed to mounting an
existing persistent disk).

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-boot\-disk\-size\fR=\fIBOOT_DISK_SIZE\fR
The size of the boot disk. This option can only be specified if a new boot disk
is being created (as opposed to mounting an existing persistent disk). The value
must be a whole number followed by a size unit of \f5\fIKB\fR\fR for kilobyte,
\f5\fIMB\fR\fR for megabyte, \f5\fIGB\fR\fR for gigabyte, or \f5\fITB\fR\fR for
terabyte. For example, \f5\fI10GB\fR\fR will produce a 10 gigabyte disk. The
minimum size a boot disk can have is 10 GB. Disk size must be a multiple of 1
GB. Limit boot disk size to 2 TB to account for MBR partition table limitations.
Default size unit is \f5\fIGB\fR\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-boot\-disk\-type\fR=\fIBOOT_DISK_TYPE\fR
The type of the boot disk. This option can only be specified if a new boot disk
is being created (as opposed to mounting an existing persistent disk). To get a
list of available disk types, run \f5$ gcloud compute disk\-types list\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-can\-ip\-forward\fR
If provided, allows the instances to send and receive packets with non\-matching
destination or source IP addresses.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-container\-arg\fR=\fICONTAINER_ARG\fR
Argument to append to container entrypoint or to override container CMD. Each
argument must have a separate flag. Arguments are appended in the order of
flags. Example:

Assuming the default entry point of the container (or an entry point overridden
with \-\-container\-command flag) is a Bourne shell\-compatible executable, in
order to execute 'ls \-l' command in the container, the user could use:

\f5\-\-container\-arg="\-c" \-\-container\-arg="ls \-l"\fR

Caveat: due to the nature of the argument parsing, it's impossible to provide
the flag value that starts with a dash (\f5\-\fR) without the \f5=\fR sign (that
is, \f5\-\-container\-arg "\-c"\fR will not work correctly).

Default: None. (no arguments appended)

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-container\-command\fR=\fICONTAINER_COMMAND\fR
Specifies what executable to run when the container starts (overrides default
entrypoint), eg. \f5nc\fR.

Default: None (default container entrypoint is used)

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-container\-env\fR=[\fIKEY\fR=\fIVALUE\fR, ...,...]
Declare environment variables KEY with value VALUE passed to container. Only the
last value of KEY is taken when KEY is repeated more than once.

Values, declared with \-\-container\-env flag override those with the same KEY
from file, provided in \-\-container\-env\-file.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-container\-env\-file\fR=\fICONTAINER_ENV_FILE\fR
Declare environment variables in a file. Values, declared with
\-\-container\-env flag override those with the same KEY from file.

File with environment variables in format used by docker (almost). This means:
.RS 2m
.IP "\(em" 2m
Lines are in format KEY=VALUE.
.IP "\(em" 2m
Values must contain equality signs.
.IP "\(em" 2m
Variables without values are not supported (this is different from docker
format).
.IP "\(em" 2m
If \f5#\fR is first non\-whitespace character in a line the line is ignored as a
comment.
.IP "\(em" 2m
Lines with nothing but whitespace are ignored.
.RE

allowed. Must be used with \f5\-\-disk\fR or \f5\-\-create\-disk\fR.


.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fBname\fR
Name of the disk. If exactly one additional disk is attached to the instance
using \f5\-\-disk\fR or \f5\-\-create\-disk\fR, specifying disk name here is
optional. The name of the single additional disk will be used by default.


.TP 2m
\fBmount\-path\fR
Path on container to mount to. Mount paths with spaces and commas (and other
special characters) are not supported by this command.

.TP 2m
\fBpartition\fR
Optional. The partition of the disk to mount. Multiple partitions of a disk may
be mounted. May not be used with \-\-create\-disk.

.TP 2m
\fBmode\fR
Volume mount mode: \f5rw\fR (read/write) or \f5ro\fR (read\-only). Defaults to
\f5rw\fR. Fails if the disk mode is \f5ro\fR and volume mount mode is \f5rw\fR.

.RE

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-container\-mount\-host\-path\fR=[\fIhost\-path\fR=\fIHOSTPATH\fR,\fImount\-path\fR=\fIMOUNTPATH\fR[,\fImode\fR=\fIMODE\fR],...]
Mounts a volume by using host\-path.

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fBhost\-path\fR
Path on host to mount from.

.TP 2m
\fBmount\-path\fR
Path on container to mount to. Mount paths with spaces and commas (and other
special characters) are not supported by this command.

special characters) are not supported by this command.

.RE
.sp
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-container\-privileged\fR
Specify whether to run container in privileged mode.

Default: \f5\-\-no\-container\-privileged\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-container\-restart\-policy\fR=\fIPOLICY\fR; default="always"
Specify whether to restart a container on exit. \fIPOLICY\fR must be one of:
\fBnever\fR, \fBon\-failure\fR, \fBalways\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-container\-stdin\fR
Keep container STDIN open even if not attached.

Default: \f5\-\-no\-container\-stdin\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-container\-tty\fR
Allocate a pseudo\-TTY for the container.

Default: \f5\-\-no\-container\-tty\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-create\-disk\fR=[\fIPROPERTY\fR=\fIVALUE\fR,...]
Creates and attaches persistent disks to the instances.

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fBname\fR
Specifies the name of the disk. This option cannot be specified if more than one
instance is being created. Must specify this option if attaching the disk to a
container with \f5\-\-container\-mount\-disk\fR.

.TP 2m
\fBdescription\fR
Optional textual description for the disk being created.

.TP 2m
\fBmode\fR
Specifies the mode of the disk. Supported options are \f5\fIro\fR\fR for
read\-only and \f5\fIrw\fR\fR for read\-write. If omitted, \f5\fIrw\fR\fR is
used as a default. It is an error to create a disk in \f5ro\fR mode if attaching
it to a container with \f5\-\-container\-mount\-disk\fR.

.TP 2m
\fBimage\fR
Specifies the name of the image that the disk will be initialized with. A new
disk will be created based on the given image. To view a list of public images
and projects, run \f5$ gcloud compute images list\fR. It is best practice to use
image when a specific version of an image is needed. If both image and
image\-family flags are omitted a blank disk will be created.

.TP 2m
\fBimage\-family\fR
The image family for the operating system that the boot disk will be initialized
with. Compute Engine offers multiple Linux distributions, some of which are
available as both regular and Shielded VM images. When a family is specified
instead of an image, the latest non\-deprecated image associated with that
family is used. It is best practice to use \-\-image\-family when the latest
version of an image is needed.

.TP 2m
\fBimage\-project\fR
The Google Cloud project against which all image and image family references
will be resolved. It is best practice to define image\-project. A full list of
available projects can be generated by running \f5gcloud projects list\fR.

.RS 2m
.IP "\(bu" 2m
If specifying one of our public images, image\-project must be provided.
.IP "\(bu" 2m
If there are several of the same image\-family value in multiple projects,
image\-project must be specified to clarify the image to be used.
.IP "\(bu" 2m
If not specified and either image or image\-family is provided, the current
default project is used.

.RE
.sp
.TP 2m
\fBsize\fR
The size of the disk. The value must be a whole number followed by a size unit
of \f5\fIKB\fR\fR for kilobyte, \f5\fIMB\fR\fR for megabyte, \f5\fIGB\fR\fR for
gigabyte, or \f5\fITB\fR\fR for terabyte. For example, \f5\fI10GB\fR\fR will
produce a 10 gigabyte disk. Disk size must be a multiple of 1 GB. If not
specified, the default image size will be used for the new disk.

.TP 2m
\fBtype\fR
The type of the disk. To get a list of available disk types, run $ gcloud
compute disk\-types list. The default disk type is \f5\fIpd\-standard\fR\fR.

.TP 2m
\fBdevice\-name\fR
An optional name that indicates the disk name the guest operating system will
see. Must be the same as \f5name\fR if used with
\f5\-\-container\-mount\-disk\fR. If omitted, a device name of the form
\f5persistent\-disk\-N\fR will be used. If omitted and used with
\f5\-\-container\-mount\-disk\fR (where the \f5name\fR of the container mount
disk is the same as in this flag), a device name equal to disk \f5name\fR will
be used.

.TP 2m
\fBauto\-delete\fR
If \f5\fIyes\fR\fR, this persistent disk will be automatically deleted when the
instance is deleted. However, if the disk is later detached from the instance,
this option won't apply. The default value for this is \f5\fIyes\fR\fR.

.TP 2m
\fBmulti\-writer\fR
If \f5\fIyes\fR\fR, create the disk in multi\-writer mode so that it can be
attached with read\-write access to multiple VMs. Can only be used with zonal
SSD persistent disks. Disks in multi\-writer mode do not support resize and
snapshot operations. The default value is \f5\fIno\fR\fR.

.RE
.sp
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-description\fR=\fIDESCRIPTION\fR

Attaches persistent disks to the instances. The disks specified must already
exist.

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fBname\fR
The disk to attach to the instances. When creating more than one instance and
using this property, the only valid mode for attaching the disk is read\-only
(see \fBmode\fR below).

.TP 2m
\fBmode\fR
Specifies the mode of the disk. Supported options are \f5\fIro\fR\fR for
read\-only and \f5\fIrw\fR\fR for read\-write. If omitted, \f5\fIrw\fR\fR is
used as a default. It is an error for mode to be \f5\fIrw\fR\fR when creating
more than one instance because read\-write disks can only be attached to a
single instance.

.TP 2m
\fBboot\fR
If \f5\fIyes\fR\fR, indicates that this is a boot disk. The virtual machines
will use the first partition of the disk for their root file systems. The
default value for this is \f5\fIno\fR\fR.

.TP 2m
\fBdevice\-name\fR
An optional name that indicates the disk name the guest operating system will
see. Must be the same as \f5name\fR if used with
\f5\-\-container\-mount\-disk\fR. If omitted, a device name of the form
\f5persistent\-disk\-N\fR will be used. If omitted and used with
\f5\-\-container\-mount\-disk\fR (where the \f5name\fR of the container mount
disk is the same as in this flag), a device name equal to disk \f5name\fR will
be used.

.TP 2m
\fBauto\-delete\fR
If \f5\fIyes\fR\fR, this persistent disk will be automatically deleted when the
instance is deleted. However, if the disk is later detached from the instance,
this option won't apply. The default value for this is \f5\fIyes\fR\fR.

.TP 2m
\fBscope\fR
Can be \f5zonal\fR or \f5regional\fR. If \f5\fIzonal\fR\fR, the disk is
interpreted as a zonal disk in the same zone as the instance (default). If
\f5\fIregional\fR\fR, the disk is interpreted as a regional disk in the same
region as the instance. The default value for this is \f5\fIzonal\fR\fR.

Attaches a local NVDIMM to the instances.

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fBsize\fR
Optional. Size of the NVDIMM disk. The value must be a whole number followed by
a size unit of \f5\fIKB\fR\fR for kilobyte, \f5\fIMB\fR\fR for megabyte,
\f5\fIGB\fR\fR for gigabyte, or \f5\fITB\fR\fR for terabyte. For example,
\f5\fI3TB\fR\fR will produce a 3 terabyte disk. Allowed values are: 3TB and 6TB

This flag is currently in BETA and may change without notice.

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fBdevice\-name\fR
Optional. A name that indicates the disk name the guest operating system will
see. Can only be specified if \f5interface\fR is \f5SCSI\fR. If omitted, a
device name of the form \f5\fIlocal\-ssd\-N\fR\fR will be used.

.TP 2m
\fBinterface\fR
Optional. The kind of disk interface exposed to the VM for this SSD. Valid
values are \f5\fISCSI\fR\fR and \f5\fINVME\fR\fR. SCSI is the default and is

keys have special meanings:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fBstartup\-script\fR
Specifies a script that will be executed by the instances once they start
running. For convenience, \f5\fI\-\-metadata\-from\-file\fR\fR can be used to
pull the value from a file.

.TP 2m
\fBstartup\-script\-url\fR
Same as \f5\fIstartup\-script\fR\fR except that the script contents are pulled
from a publicly\-accessible location on the web.

.RE
.sp
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-metadata\-from\-file\fR=\fIKEY\fR=\fILOCAL_FILE_PATH\fR,[...]
Same as \f5\fI\-\-metadata\fR\fR except that the value for the entry will be
read from a local file. This is useful for values that are too large such as
\f5\fIstartup\-script\fR\fR contents.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-min\-cpu\-platform\fR=\fIPLATFORM\fR

Specifies the subnet that the interface will be part of. If network key is also
specified this must be a subnetwork of the specified network.

.TP 2m
\fBaliases\fR
Specifies the IP alias ranges to allocate for this interface. If there are
multiple IP alias ranges, they are separated by semicolons.

For example:

.RS 2m
\-\-aliases="10.128.1.0/24;range1:/32"
.RE


Each IP alias range consists of a range name and an IP range separated by a
colon, or just the IP range. The range name is the name of the range within the
network interface's subnet from which to allocate an IP alias range. If
unspecified, it defaults to the primary IP range of the subnet. The IP range can
be a CIDR range (e.g. \f5192.168.100.0/24\fR), a single IP address (e.g.
\f5192.168.100.1\fR), or a netmask in CIDR format (e.g. \f5/24\fR). If the IP
range is specified by CIDR range or single IP address, it must belong to the
CIDR range specified by the range name on the subnet. If the IP range is
specified by netmask, the IP allocator will pick an available range with the
specified netmask and allocate it to this network interface.

\fB\-\-zone\fR=\fIZONE\fR
Zone of the instances to create. If not specified, the user may be prompted to
select a zone. \f5gcloud\fR will attempt to identify the zone by searching for
resources in the user's project. If the zone cannot be determined, the user will
then be prompted with all Google Cloud Platform zones.

To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, the user can set the
\f5\fIcompute/zone\fR\fR property:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE
.RE

A list of zones can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute zones list
.RE

To unset the property, run:

.RS 2m
