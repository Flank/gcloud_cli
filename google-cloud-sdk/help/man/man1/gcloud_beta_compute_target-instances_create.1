.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(BETA)\fR \fBgcloud beta compute target\-instances create\fR is used to
create a target instance for handling traffic from one or more forwarding rules.
Target instances are ideal for traffic that should be managed by a single
source. For more information on target instances, see
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/protocol\-forwarding/#targetinstances



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fINAME\fR
Name of the target instance to operate on.


.RE
.sp

.SH "REQUIRED FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-instance\fR=\fIINSTANCE\fR
The name of the virtual machine instance that will handle the traffic.


.RE

.SH "OPTIONAL FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-description\fR=\fIDESCRIPTION\fR
An optional, textual description of the target instance.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-instance\-zone\fR=\fIINSTANCE_ZONE\fR
Zone of the instance to operate on. If not specified, it will be set to the same
as zone. Overrides the default \fBcompute/zone\fR property value for this
command invocation.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-network\fR=\fINETWORK\fR
Network that this target instance applies to. This is only necessary if the
corresponding instance has multiple network interfaces. If not specified, the
default network interface will be used.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-zone\fR=\fIZONE\fR
Zone of the target instance to operate on. If not specified and the
\f5\fIcompute/zone\fR\fR property isn't set, you may be prompted to select a
zone.

To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
\f5\fIcompute/zone\fR\fR property:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE
.RE

A list of zones can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute zones list
.RE

To unset the property, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config unset compute/zone
.RE

Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
\f5\fICLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE\fR\fR.
