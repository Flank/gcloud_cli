.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(BETA)\fR \fBgcloud beta compute disks snapshot\fR creates snapshots of
persistent disks. Snapshots are useful for backing up data, copying a persistent
disk, and even, creating a custom image. Snapshots can be created from
persistent disks even while they are attached to running instances. Once
created, snapshots may be managed (listed, deleted, resized etc.) via \f5gcloud
compute snapshots\fR.

Refer to the Snapshot best practices guide.
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/snapshot\-best\-practices

gcloud beta compute disks snapshot waits until the operation returns a status of
\f5READY\fR or \f5FAILED\fR, or reaches the maximum timeout, and returns the
last known details of the snapshot.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fIDISK_NAME\fR [\fIDISK_NAME\fR ...]
Names of the disks to operate on.

.SH "FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-async\fR
Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to complete.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-csek\-key\-file\fR=\fIFILE\fR
Path to a Customer\-Supplied Encryption Key (CSEK) key file, mapping Google
Compute Engine resources to user managed keys to be used when creating,
mounting, or snapshotting disks.

If you pass \f5\-\fR as value of the flag the CSEK will be read from stdin. See
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer\-supplied\-encryption for
more details.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-description\fR=\fIDESCRIPTION\fR
Text to describe the snapshots being created.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-guest\-flush\fR
Create an application\-consistent snapshot by informing the OS to prepare for
the snapshot process. Currently only supported on Windows instances using the
Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS).

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-labels\fR=[\fIKEY\fR=\fIVALUE\fR,...]
List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens (\f5\-\fR),
underscores (\f5_\fR), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must contain
only hyphens (\f5\-\fR), underscores (\f5_\fR), lowercase characters, and
numbers.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-snapshot\-names\fR=\fISNAPSHOT_NAME\fR,[...]
Names to assign to the created snapshots. Without this option, the name of each
snapshot will be a random 12\-character alphanumeric string that starts with a
letter. The values of this option run parallel to the disks specified. For
example,

.RS 2m
gcloud beta compute disks snapshot my\-disk\-1 my\-disk\-2 my\-disk\-3 \-\-snapshot\-names snapshot\-1,snapshot\-2,snapshot\-3
.RE

will result in \f5my\-disk\-1\fR being snapshotted as \f5snapshot\-1\fR,
\f5my\-disk\-2\fR as \f5snapshot\-2\fR, and so on.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-storage\-location\fR=\fILOCATION\fR
Google Cloud Storage location, either regional or multi\-regional, where
snapshot content is to be stored. If absent, a nearby regional or
multi\-regional location is chosen automatically.

.TP 2m

At most one of these may be specified:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-region\fR=\fIREGION\fR
Region of the disks to operate on. If not specified, you may be prompted to
select a region.

To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
\f5\fIcompute/region\fR\fR property:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config set compute/region REGION
.RE

A list of regions can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute regions list
.RE

To unset the property, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config unset compute/region
.RE

Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
\f5\fICLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION\fR\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-zone\fR=\fIZONE\fR
Zone of the disks to operate on. If not specified and the
\f5\fIcompute/zone\fR\fR property isn't set, you may be prompted to select a
zone.

To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
\f5\fIcompute/zone\fR\fR property:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE
.RE

A list of zones can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute zones list
.RE

To unset the property, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config unset compute/zone
.RE

Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
\f5\fICLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE\fR\fR.
