.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR Creates a new version of a Cloud ML Engine model.

.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fIVERSION\fR
Name of the model version.


.RE
.sp

.SH "REQUIRED FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-model\fR=\fIMODEL\fR
Name of the model.

.SH "OPTIONAL FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-async\fR
Display information about the operation in progress, without waiting for the
operation to complete.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-config\fR=\fICONFIG\fR
Path to a YAML configuration file containing configuration parameters for the
Version (https://cloud.google.com/ml/reference/rest/v1/projects.models.versions)
to create.

The file is in YAML format. Note that not all attributes of a Version are
configurable; available attributes (with example values) are:

.RS 2m
description: A free\-form description of the version.
deploymentUri: gs://path/to/source
runtimeVersion: '1.0'
manualScaling:
  nodes: 10  # The number of nodes to allocate for this model.
autoScaling:
  minNodes: 0  # The minimum number of nodes to allocate for this model.
labels:
  user\-defined\-key: user\-defined\-value
.RE

The name of the version must always be specified via the required VERSION
argument.

Only one of manualScaling or autoScaling must be specified. If both are
specified in same yaml file an error will be returned.

If an option is specified both in the configuration file and via command line
arguments, the command line arguments override the configuration file.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-description\fR=\fIDESCRIPTION\fR
The description of the version.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-framework\fR=\fIFRAMEWORK\fR
The ML framework used to train this version of the model. If not specified,
defaults to \f5tensorflow\fR. \fIFRAMEWORK\fR must be one of:
\fBscikit\-learn\fR, \fBtensorflow\fR, \fBxgboost\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-labels\fR=[\fIKEY\fR=\fIVALUE\fR,...]
A list of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-machine\-type\fR=\fIMACHINE_TYPE\fR
The type of machine on which to serve the model. Currently only applies to
online prediction. Currently supported machine_types are:

.RS 2m
.IP "\(em" 2m
\f5mls1\-highmem\-1\fR \- A virtual machine with 1 core and 2 Gb RAM.
.IP "\(em" 2m
\f5mls1\-highcpu\-4\fR \- A virtual machine with 4 core and 2 Gb RAM.

.RS 2m
If not provided defaults to `mls1\-highmem\-1`.

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-origin\fR=\fIORIGIN\fR
Location of \f5model/\fR "directory" (as output by
https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/api_docs/python/state_ops.html#Saver).

This overrides \f5deploymentUri\fR in the \f5\-\-config\fR file. If this flag is
not passed, \f5deploymentUri\fR \fBmust\fR be specified in the file from
\f5\-\-config\fR.

Can be a Google Cloud Storage (\f5gs://\fR) path or local file path (no prefix).
In the latter case the files will be uploaded to Google Cloud Storage and a
\f5\-\-staging\-bucket\fR argument is required.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-python\-version\fR=\fIPYTHON_VERSION\fR
The version of Python used when creating the version. If not set, the default
version is 2.7. Python 3.5 is available when \f5runtime_version\fR is set to 1.4
and above. Python 2.7 works with all supported runtime versions.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-runtime\-version\fR=\fIRUNTIME_VERSION\fR
The Google Cloud ML Engine runtime version for this job. Defaults to a stable
version, which is defined in the documentation along with the list of supported
versions:
https://cloud.google.com/ml\-engine/docs/tensorflow/runtime\-version\-list

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-staging\-bucket\fR=\fISTAGING_BUCKET\fR
Bucket in which to stage training archives.

Required only if a file upload is necessary (that is, other flags include local
paths) and no other flags implicitly specify an upload path.
