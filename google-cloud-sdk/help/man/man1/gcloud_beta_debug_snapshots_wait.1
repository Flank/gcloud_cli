.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(BETA)\fR This command waits for one or more snapshots on a Cloud Debugger
debug target to become completed. A snapshot is considered completed either if
there was an error setting the snapshot or if the snapshot was hit on an
instance of the debug target.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
[\fIID\fR ...]
Zero or more snapshot resource identifiers. The command will wait for any of the
specified snapshots to complete.

.SH "FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-all\fR
If set, wait for all of the specified snapshots to complete, instead of waiting
for any one of them to complete.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-all\-users\fR
If set, wait for matching snapshots from all users, rather than only the current
user.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-location\fR=\fILOCATION\-REGEXP\fR
A regular expression to match against snapshot locations. The command will wait
for any snapshots matching these criteria to complete. You may specify
\-\-location multiple times.

EXAMPLE:

.RS 2m
gcloud beta debug snapshots wait \e
  \-\-location foo.py:[1\-3] \-\-location bar.py:3
.RE

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-target\fR=(\fIID\fR|\fIDESCRIPTION_REGEXP\fR)
The debug target. It may be a target ID or name obtained from 'debug targets
list', or it may be a regular expression uniquely specifying a debuggee based on
its description or name. For App Engine projects, if not specified, the default
target is the most recent deployment of the default module and version.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-timeout\fR=\fITIMEOUT\fR; default="unlimited"
Maximum number of seconds to wait for a snapshot to complete. By default, wait
indefinitely.

.SH "LIST COMMAND FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-filter\fR=\fIEXPRESSION\fR
Apply a Boolean filter \fIEXPRESSION\fR to each resource item to be listed. If
the expression evaluates True then that item is listed. For more details and
examples of filter expressions run $ gcloud topic filters. This flag interacts
with other flags that are applied in this order: \fB\-\-flatten\fR,
\fB\-\-sort\-by\fR, \fB\-\-filter\fR, \fB\-\-limit\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-limit\fR=\fILIMIT\fR
The maximum number of resources to list. The default is \fBunlimited\fR. This
flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
\fB\-\-flatten\fR, \fB\-\-sort\-by\fR, \fB\-\-filter\fR, \fB\-\-limit\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-sort\-by\fR=[\fIFIELD\fR,...]
A comma\-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The default
order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending order on that
field. This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
\fB\-\-flatten\fR, \fB\-\-sort\-by\fR, \fB\-\-filter\fR, \fB\-\-limit\fR.
