.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fBgcloud compute url\-maps add\-host\-rule\fR is used to add a mapping of hosts
to a patch matcher in a URL map. The mapping will match the host component of
HTTP requests to path matchers which in turn map the request to a backend
service. Before adding a host rule, at least one path matcher must exist in the
URL map to take care of the path component of the requests. \f5gcloud compute
url\-maps add\-path\-matcher\fR or \f5gcloud compute url\-maps edit\fR can be
used to add path matchers.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fIURL_MAP_NAME\fR
Name of the URL map to operate on.

.SH "REQUIRED FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-hosts\fR=\fIHOST\fR,[\fIHOST\fR,...]
The set of hosts to match requests against. Each host must be a fully qualified
domain name (FQDN) with the exception that the host can begin with a ``*'' or
``*\-''. ``*'' acts as a glob and will match any string of atoms to the left
where an atom is separated by dots (``.'') or dashes (``\-'').

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-path\-matcher\-name\fR=\fIPATH_MATCHER_NAME\fR
The name of the patch matcher to use if a request matches this host rule. The
patch matcher must already exist in the URL map (see \f5gcloud compute url\-maps
add\-path\-matcher\fR).

.SH "OPTIONAL FLAGS"

\fB\-\-description\fR=\fIDESCRIPTION\fR
An optional, textual description for the host rule.

To create a host rule mapping the \f5*\-foo.example.com\fR and \f5example.com\fR
hosts to the \f5www\fR path matcher, run:

.RS 2m
