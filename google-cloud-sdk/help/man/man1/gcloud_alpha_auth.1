\f5gcloud alpha auth\fR \fICOMMAND\fR [\fIGCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG\ ...\fR]



.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR The gcloud auth command group lets you grant and revoke
authorization to Cloud SDK (gcloud) to access Google Cloud Platform. Typically,
when scripting Cloud SDK tools for use on multiple machines, using \f5gcloud
auth activate\-service\-account\fR is recommended.

For more information on authorization and credential types, see:
https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/authorizing.

While running \f5gcloud auth\fR commands, the \f5\-\-account\fR flag can be
specified to any command to use that account without activation.

These flags are available to all commands: \-\-account, \-\-billing\-project,
\-\-configuration, \-\-flags\-file, \-\-flatten, \-\-format, \-\-help,
\-\-impersonate\-service\-account, \-\-log\-http, \-\-project, \-\-quiet,
\-\-trace\-token, \-\-user\-output\-enabled, \-\-verbosity.
