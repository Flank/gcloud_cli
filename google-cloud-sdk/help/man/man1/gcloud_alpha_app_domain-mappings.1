\f5gcloud alpha app domain\-mappings\fR \fICOMMAND\fR [\fIGCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG\ ...\fR]



.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR This set of commands can be used to view and manage your app's
domain mappings.

App Engine Domain Mappings allow an application to be served via one or many
custom domains, such as \f5example.com\fR, instead of the default
\f5https://<PROJECT\-ID>.<REGION\-ID>.r.appspot.com\fR address. You can use a
custom domain with or without SSL.

Use the AUTOMATIC management type to automatically provision an SSL certificate
for your domain. Use the MANUAL management type to provide your own certificate
or omit SSL.

\-\-trace\-token, \-\-user\-output\-enabled, \-\-verbosity.
