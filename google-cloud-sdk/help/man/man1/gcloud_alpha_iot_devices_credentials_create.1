.SH "REQUIRED FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-path\fR=\fIPATH\fR
The path on disk to the file containing the key.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-type\fR=\fITYPE\fR
The type of the key. \fITYPE\fR must be one of:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fBes256\fR
Deprecated nmame for \f5es256\-pem\fR
.TP 2m
\fBes256\-pem\fR
Public key for the ECDSA algorithm using P\-256 and SHA\-256, encoded in base64,
and wrapped by \f5\-\-\-\-\-BEGIN PUBLIC KEY\-\-\-\-\-\fR and \f5\-\-\-\-\-END
PUBLIC KEY\-\-\-\-\-\fR. This can be used to verify JWT tokens with the
\f5ES256\fR algorithm (RFC7518 (https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7518.txt)). This
curve is defined in OpenSSL (https://www.openssl.org/) as the \f5prime256v1\fR
curve.
.TP 2m
\fBes256\-x509\-pem\fR
As ES256_PEM, but wrapped in an X.509v3 certificate (RFC5280
(https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5280.txt)), encoded in base64, and wrapped by
\f5\-\-\-\-\-BEGIN CERTIFICATE\-\-\-\-\-\fR and \f5\-\-\-\-\-END
CERTIFICATE\-\-\-\-\-\fR.
.TP 2m
\fBrs256\fR
Deprecated name for \f5rsa\-x509\-pem\fR
.TP 2m
\fBrsa\-pem\fR
An RSA public key encoded in base64, and wrapped by \f5\-\-\-\-\-BEGIN PUBLIC
KEY\-\-\-\-\-\fR and \f5\-\-\-\-\-END PUBLIC KEY\-\-\-\-\-\fR. This can be used
to verify \f5RS256\fR signatures in JWT tokens (RFC7518
(https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7518.txt)).
.TP 2m
\fBrsa\-x509\-pem\fR
As RSA_PEM, but wrapped in an X.509v3 certificate (RFC5280

.TP 2m

Device resource \- The device for which to create credentials. The arguments in
this group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some
attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.
To set the [project] attribute: provide the argument [\-\-device] on the command
line with a fully specified name; provide the argument [\-\-project] on the
command line; set the property [core/project]. This must be specified.

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-device\fR=\fIDEVICE\fR
ID of the device or fully qualified identifier for the device. This flag must be
specified if any of the other arguments in this group are specified.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-region\fR=\fIREGION\fR
The Cloud region for the device.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-registry\fR=\fIREGISTRY\fR
The device registry for the device.

.SH "OPTIONAL FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-expiration\-time\fR=\fIEXPIRATION_TIME\fR
The expiration time for the key. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on
time formats.

.SH "EXAMPLES"

To add an RSA public key wrapped in an X.509v3 certificate to a device, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha iot devices credentials create \-\-region=us\-central1 \e
    \-\-registry=my\-registry \-\-device=my\-device \e
    \-\-path=/path/to/cert.pem \-\-type=rsa\-x509\-pem
.RE

To add a public key for the ECDSA algorithm to a device, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha iot devices credentials create \-\-region=us\-central1 \e
    \-\-registry=my\-registry \-\-device=my\-device \e
    \-\-path=/path/to/ec_public.pem \-\-type=es256\-pem
.RE



.SH "NOTES"

This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right project,
you may be trying to access an API with an invitation\-only early access
allowlist. These variants are also available:
