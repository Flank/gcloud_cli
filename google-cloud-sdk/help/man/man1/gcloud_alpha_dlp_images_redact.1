.SH "OPTIONAL FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-include\-quote\fR
If True, the server will attempt to filter out profanities, replacing all but
the initial character in each filtered word with asterisks, e.g. \e"f**\fB\e".

.TP 2m
\fR\-\-min\-likelihood\fB=\fIMIN_LIKELIHOOD\fR; default="possible"
Only return findings equal to or above this threshold. One of:
\f5very\-unlikely\fR, \f5unlikely\fR, \f5possible\fR, \f5likely\fR,
\f5very\-likely\fR. The default value is \f5possible\fR. \fIMIN_LIKELIHOOD\fR
must be one of: \fRlikely\fB, \fRpossible\fB, \fRunlikely\fB,
\fRvery\-likely\fB, \fRvery\-unlikely\fB.

.TP 2m
\fR\-\-redact\-all\-text\fB
If specified, all text info in the image will be removed, whether it is detected
as sensitive or not.

.TP 2m
\fR\-\-redact\-color\fB=\fIREDACT_COLOR\fR
The color to use when redacting content from an image. If not specified, the
default value is black. Colors should be specified as a string of \f5r,g,b\fR
float values in the interval [0,1] representing the amount of red, green, and
blue in the color, respectively. For example, \f5black = 0,0,0\fR, \f5red =
1.0,0,0\fR, \f5white = 1.0,1.0,1.0\fR, and so on.
