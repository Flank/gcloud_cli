\fB\-\-blocked\fR
If blocked, connections from this device will fail.

Can be used to temporarily prevent the device from connecting if, for example,
the sensor is generating bad data and needs maintenance.



Use \f5\-\-no\-blocked\fR to enable connections and \f5\-\-blocked\fR to
disable.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-metadata\fR=[\fIKEY\fR=\fIVALUE\fR,...]
The metadata key/value pairs assigned to devices. This metadata is not
interpreted or indexed by Cloud IoT Core. It can be used to add contextual
information for the device.

Keys should only contain the following characters \f5[a\-zA\-Z0\-9\-_]\fR and be
fewer than 128 bytes in length. Values are free\-form strings. Each value must
be fewer than or equal to 32 KB in size.

The total size of all keys and values must be less than 256 KB, and the maximum
number of key\-value pairs is 500.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-metadata\-from\-file\fR=[\fIKEY\fR=\fIPATH\fR,...]
Same as \-\-metadata, but the metadata values will be read from the file
specified by path.
