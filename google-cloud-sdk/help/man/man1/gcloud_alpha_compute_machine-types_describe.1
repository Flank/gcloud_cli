.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR \fBgcloud alpha compute machine\-types describe\fR displays all
data associated with a Compute Engine machine type.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fINAME\fR
Name of the machine type to describe.


.RE

.SH "FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-zone\fR=\fIZONE\fR
Zone of the machine type to describe. If not specified and the
\f5\fIcompute/zone\fR\fR property isn't set, you may be prompted to select a
zone.

To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
\f5\fIcompute/zone\fR\fR property:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE
.RE

A list of zones can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute zones list
.RE

To unset the property, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config unset compute/zone
.RE

Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
\f5\fICLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE\fR\fR.

Run \fB$ gcloud help\fR for details.



.SH "EXAMPLES"

To describe a machine type 'MACHINE\-TYPE' in zone 'us\-central1\-f', run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha compute machine\-types describe MACHINE\-TYPE \e
    \-\-zone=us\-central1\-f
.RE



.SH "NOTES"

This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right project,
you may be trying to access an API with an invitation\-only early access
allowlist. These variants are also available:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute machine\-types describe
$ gcloud beta compute machine\-types describe
