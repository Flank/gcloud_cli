.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR gcloud alpha container hub memberships get\-credentials updates
the \f5kubeconfig\fR file with the appropriate credentials and endpoint
information to send \f5kubectl\fR commands to a Hub\-registered and connected
cluster through Connect Gateway Service.

It takes a project, passed through by set defaults or flags. By default,
credentials are written to \f5$HOME/.kube/config\fR. You can provide an
alternate path by setting the \f5KUBECONFIG\fR environment variable. If
\f5KUBECONFIG\fR contains multiple paths, the first one is used.

Upon success, this command will switch current context to the target cluster,
when working with multiple clusters.
