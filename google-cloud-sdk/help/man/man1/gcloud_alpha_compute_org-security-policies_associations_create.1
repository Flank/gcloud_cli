.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR \fBgcloud alpha compute org\-security\-policies associations
create\fR is used to create organization security policy associations. An
organization security policy is a set of rules that controls access to various
resources.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-security\-policy\fR=\fISECURITY_POLICY\fR
Security policy ID of the association.

.SH "OPTIONAL FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-name\fR=\fINAME\fR
Name to identify this association. If unspecified, the name will be set to
"organization\-{ORGANIZATION_ID}" or "folder\-{FOLDER_ID}".

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-replace\-association\-on\-target\fR
By default, if you attempt to insert an association to an organization or folder
resource that is already associated with a security policy the method will fail.
If this is set, the existing association will be deleted at the same time that
the new association is created.
