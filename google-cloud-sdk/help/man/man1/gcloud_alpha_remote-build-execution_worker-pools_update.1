.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR Updates the configuration of a Remote Build Execution worker pool.
This can be used to change the size of the worker pool, change the type of
machine, or adjust the disk size of the worker VMs.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m

Workerpool resource \- Arguments and flags specifying the worker pool to update.
The arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but can
be set in other ways. To set the [project] attribute: provide the argument
[workerpool] on the command line with a fully specified name; provide the
argument [\-\-project] on the command line; set the property [core/project].
This must be specified.

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fIWORKERPOOL\fR
ID of the workerpool or fully qualified identifier for the workerpool. This
positional must be specified if any of the other arguments in this group are
specified.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-instance\fR=\fIINSTANCE\fR
Instance name.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-disk\-size\fR=\fIDISK_SIZE\fR
Size of the disk, in Gb, for each worker. Defaults to 200Gb.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-machine\-type\fR=\fIMACHINE_TYPE\fR
The type of VM to use for each worker. To get a list of valid machine types, use
the following command:

$ gcloud compute machine\-types list

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-worker\-count\fR=\fIWORKER_COUNT\fR
Number of workers that should be in the worker pool.

.SH "API REFERENCE"

This command uses the \fBremotebuildexecution/v1alpha\fR API. The full
documentation for this API can be found at:
https://cloud.google.com/remote\-build\-execution/docs/



.SH "EXAMPLES"

The following command adjusts the nubmer of workers to 50 in a pool called
\'pool1' contained in the instance 'default_instance':

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha remote\-build\-execution worker\-pools update pool1 \e
    \-\-instance=default_instance \-\-worker\-count=50
.RE

The following command adjusts the configuration of the workers within the pool,
changing the machine type to standard 4 core machines with 500 GB disks.

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha remote\-build\-execution worker\-pools update pool1 \e
    \-\-instance=default_instance \-\-disk\-size=500 \e
