.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(BETA)\fR Submit an AI Platform training job.

This creates temporary files and executes Python code staged by a user on Cloud
Storage. Model code can either be specified with a path, e.g.:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud beta ai\-platform jobs submit training my_job \e
        \-\-module\-name trainer.task \e
        \-\-staging\-bucket gs://my\-bucket \e
        \-\-package\-path /my/code/path/trainer \e
        \-\-packages additional\-dep1.tar.gz,dep2.whl
.RE

Or by specifying an already built package:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud beta ai\-platform jobs submit training my_job \e
        \-\-module\-name trainer.task \e
        \-\-staging\-bucket gs://my\-bucket \e
        \-\-packages trainer\-0.0.1.tar.gz,additional\-dep1.tar.gz,dep2.whl
.RE

If \f5\-\-package\-path=/my/code/path/trainer\fR is specified and there is a
\f5setup.py\fR file at \f5/my/code/path/setup.py\fR, the setup file will be
invoked with \f5sdist\fR and the generated tar files will be uploaded to Cloud
Storage. Otherwise, a temporary \f5setup.py\fR file will be generated for the
build.

By default, this command runs asynchronously; it exits once the job is
successfully submitted.

To follow the progress of your job, pass the \f5\-\-stream\-logs\fR flag (note
that even with the \f5\-\-stream\-logs\fR flag, the job will continue to run
after this command exits and must be cancelled with \f5gcloud ai\-platform jobs
cancel JOB_ID\fR).

For more information, see:
https://cloud.google.com/ai\-platform/training/docs/overview



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

If an option is specified both in the configuration file **and** via command
line arguments, the command line arguments override the configuration file.

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-job\-dir\fR=\fIJOB_DIR\fR
Cloud Storage path in which to store training outputs and other data needed for
training.

This path will be passed to your TensorFlow program as the \f5\-\-job\-dir\fR
command\-line arg. The benefit of specifying this field is that AI Platform will
validate the path for use in training. However, note that your training program
will need to parse the provided \f5\-\-job\-dir\fR argument.

If packages must be uploaded and \f5\-\-staging\-bucket\fR is not provided, this
path will be used instead.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-labels\fR=[\fIKEY\fR=\fIVALUE\fR,...]
List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens (\f5\-\fR),
underscores (\f5_\fR), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must contain
only hyphens (\f5\-\fR), underscores (\f5_\fR), lowercase characters, and
numbers.

(https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs) to which the Job is peered with. For
example, \f5\fIprojects/12345/global/networks/myVPC\fR\fR. The format is of the
form projects/{project}/global/networks/{network}, where {project} is a project
number, as in '12345', and {network} is network name. Private services access
must already have been configured
(https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure\-private\-services\-access) for the
network. If unspecified, the Job is not peered with any network.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-package\-path\fR=\fIPACKAGE_PATH\fR
Path to a Python package to build. This should point to a \fBlocal\fR directory
containing the Python source for the job. It will be built using
\fBsetuptools\fR (which must be installed) using its \fBparent\fR directory as
context. If the parent directory contains a \f5setup.py\fR file, the build will
use that; otherwise, it will use a simple built\-in one.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-packages\fR=[\fIPACKAGE\fR,...]
Path to Python archives used for training. These can be local paths (absolute or
relative), in which case they will be uploaded to the Cloud Storage bucket given

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-python\-version\fR=\fIPYTHON_VERSION\fR
Version of Python used during training. Choices are 3.7, 3.5, and 2.7. However,
this value must be compatible with the chosen runtime version for the job.

Must be used with a compatible runtime version:

.RS 2m

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-region\fR=\fIREGION\fR
Region of the machine learning training job to submit. If not specified, you may
be prompted to select a region.

To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
\f5\fIcompute/region\fR\fR property:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config set compute/region REGION
.RE

A list of regions can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute regions list
.RE

To unset the property, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config unset compute/region
.RE

Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
\f5\fICLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION\fR\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-runtime\-version\fR=\fIRUNTIME_VERSION\fR
AI Platform runtime version for this job. Must be specified unless
\-\-master\-image\-uri is specified instead. It is defined in documentation
along with the list of supported versions:

Specify the machine types, the number of replicas for workers, and parameter
servers. \fISCALE_TIER\fR must be one of:

.RS 2m

Platform, and for experimenting with new models using small datasets.

\fBbasic\-gpu\fR
Single worker instance with a GPU.
.TP 2m
\fBbasic\-tpu\fR
Single worker instance with a Cloud TPU.
.TP 2m
\fBcustom\fR
CUSTOM tier is not a set tier, but rather enables you to use your own cluster
specification. When you use this tier, set values to configure your processing
cluster according to these guidelines (using the \f5\-\-config\fR flag):

.RS 2m
.IP "\(bu" 2m

to use for your master node. This is the only required setting.
.IP "\(bu" 2m
You \fImay\fR set \f5TrainingInput.workerCount\fR to specify the number of
workers to use. If you specify one or more workers, you \fImust\fR also set
\f5TrainingInput.workerType\fR to specify the type of machine to use for your
worker nodes.
.IP "\(bu" 2m
You \fImay\fR set \f5TrainingInput.parameterServerCount\fR to specify the number
of parameter servers to use. If you specify one or more parameter servers, you
\fImust\fR also set \f5TrainingInput.parameterServerType\fR to specify the type
