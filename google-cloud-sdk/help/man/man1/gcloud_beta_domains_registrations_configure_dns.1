.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(BETA)\fR Configure DNS settings of a Cloud Domains registration.

In most cases, this command is used for changing the authoritative name servers
and DNSSEC options for the given domain. However, advanced options like glue
records are available.

When using Cloud DNS Zone or Google Domains name servers, DNSSEC will be enabled
by default where possible. You can disable it using the \-\-disable\-dnssec
flag.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m

Registration resource \- The domain registration to configure DNS settings for.
This represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments
in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the [project] attribute:
provide the argument [registration] on the command line with a fully specified
name; provide the argument [\-\-project] on the command line; set the property
[core/project]. To set the [location] attribute: provide the argument
[registration] on the command line with a fully specified name; location is
always global. This must be specified.

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fIREGISTRATION\fR
ID of the registration or fully qualified identifier for the registration.

.SH "COMMONLY USED FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-validate\-only\fR
Don't actually configure DNS settings of the registration. Only validate
arguments.

.TP 2m

Set the authoritative name servers for the given domain.

Warning: Do not change name servers if ds_records is non\-empty. Clear
ds_records first by calling this command with the \-\-disable\-dnssec flag, and
wait 24 hours before changing name servers. Otherwise your domain may stop
serving.

At most one of these may be specified:


.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-cloud\-dns\-zone\fR=\fICLOUD_DNS_ZONE\fR
The name of the Cloud DNS managed\-zone to set as the name server for the
domain. If it's in the same project, you can use short name. If not, use the
full resource name, e.g.:
\-\-cloud\-dns\-zone=projects/example\-project/managedZones/example\-zone. If
the zone is signed, DNSSEC will be enabled by default unless you pass
\-\-disable\-dnssec.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-dns\-settings\-from\-file\fR=\fIDNS_SETTINGS_FILE_NAME\fR
A YAML file containing the required DNS settings. If specified, its content will
replace the values currently used in the registration resource. If the file is
missing some of the dns_settings fields, those fields will be cleared.

Examples of file contents:

.RS 2m
googleDomainsDns:
  dsState: DS_RECORDS_PUBLISHED
glueRecords:
\- hostName: ns1.example.com
  ipv4Addresses:
  \- 8.8.8.8
\- hostName: ns2.example.com
  ipv4Addresses:

List of DNS name servers for the domain.
