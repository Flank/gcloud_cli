.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(BETA)\fR This command creates a Binary Authorization attestation for your
project. The attestation is created for the specified artifact (e.g. a grc.io
container URL), associate with the specified attestor, and stored under the
specified project.



.SH "REQUIRED FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-artifact\-url\fR=\fIARTIFACT_URL\fR
Container URL. May be in the \f5\fB.gcr.io/repository/image\fR format, or may
optionally contain the \f5http\fR or \f5https\fR scheme

.TP 2m
\fR\-\-pgp\-key\-fingerprint\fB=\fIPGP_KEY_FINGERPRINT\fR
The cryptographic ID of the key used to generate the signature. For Binary
Authorization, this must be the version 4, full 160\-bit fingerprint, expressed
as a 40 character hexidecimal string. See
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880#section\-12.2 for details.

.TP 2m
\fR\-\-signature\-file\fB=\fISIGNATURE_FILE\fR
Path to file containing the signature to store, or \f5\-\fR to read signature
from stdin.

.TP 2m

Attestor resource \- The Attestor whose Container Analysis Note will be used to
host the created attestation. In order to successfully attach the attestation,
the active gcloud account (core/account) must be able to read this attestor and
must have the \f5containeranalysis.notes.attachOccurrence\fR permission for the
Attestor's underlying Note resource (usually via the
\f5containeranalysis.notes.attacher\fR role). The arguments in this group can be
used to specify the attributes of this resource. This must be specified.


.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fR\-\-attestor\fB=\fIATTESTOR\fR
The ID of the attestor or a fully qualified identifier for the attestor. This
flag must be specified if any of the other arguments in this group are
specified.

.TP 2m
\fR\-\-attestor\-project\fB=\fIATTESTOR_PROJECT\fR
The Cloud project for the attestor.
