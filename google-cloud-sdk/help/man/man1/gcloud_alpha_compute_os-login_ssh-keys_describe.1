\f5gcloud alpha compute os\-login ssh\-keys describe\fR (\fB\-\-key\fR=\fIKEY\fR\ |\ \fB\-\-key\-file\fR=\fIKEY_FILE\fR) [\fIGCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG\ ...\fR]



.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR \fBgcloud alpha compute os\-login ssh\-keys describe\fR accepts
either a string containing an SSH Public Key or a filename for an SSH Public key
and displays that key from the user's OS Login Profile. The key value used can
either be the full SSH key or the OS Login fingerprint for that key.



.SH "REQUIRED FLAGS"

.TP 2m

Exactly one of these must be specified:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-key\fR=\fIKEY\fR
The SSH public key to describe from the OS Login Profile. Key value can either
be the SSH key or the OS Login fingerprint of the key.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-key\-file\fR=\fIKEY_FILE\fR
