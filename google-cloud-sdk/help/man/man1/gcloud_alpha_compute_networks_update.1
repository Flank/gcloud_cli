.TP 2m
\fINAME\fR
Name of the network to operate on.

.SH "FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-async\fR
Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to complete.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-mtu\fR=\fIMTU\fR
Maximum transmission unit (MTU) is the size of the largest IP packet that can be
transmitted on this network. Default value is 1460 bytes, and the maximum is
1500 bytes. The MTU advertised via DHCP to all instances attached to this
network.

.TP 2m

At most one of these may be specified:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-bgp\-routing\-mode\fR=\fIMODE\fR
The target BGP routing mode for this network. \fIMODE\fR must be one of:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fBglobal\fR
Cloud Routers in this network advertise subnetworks from all regions to their
BGP peers, and program instances in all regions with the router's best learned
BGP routes.
.TP 2m
\fBregional\fR
Cloud Routers in this network advertise subnetworks from their local region only
to their BGP peers, and program instances in their local region only with the
router's best learned BGP routes.
