.SH "REQUIRED FLAGS"

.RS 2m

network.

.TP 2m

.SH "OPTIONAL FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-async\fR
Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to complete.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-auto\-create\-routes\fR
(DEPRECATED) If set, will automatically create routes for the network peering.
Flag auto\-create\-routes is deprecated. Peer network subnet routes are always
created in a network when peered.

Flag \-\-auto\-create\-routes is deprecated and will be removed in a future
release.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-export\-custom\-routes\fR
If set, the network will export custom routes to peer network. Use
\-\-no\-export\-custom\-routes to disable it.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-import\-custom\-routes\fR
If set, the network will import custom routes from peer network. Use
\-\-no\-import\-custom\-routes to disable it.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-peer\-project\fR=\fIPEER_PROJECT\fR
The name of the project for the peer network. If not specified, defaults to
current project.
