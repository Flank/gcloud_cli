.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(BETA)\fR Create and add a task that targets App Engine.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
[\fITASK_ID\fR]
The task to create.

If not specified then the system will generate a random unique task ID.
Explicitly specifying a task ID enables task de\-duplication. If a task's ID is
identical to that of an existing task or a task that was deleted or completed
recently then the call will fail.

Because there is an extra lookup cost to identify duplicate task names, tasks
created with IDs have significantly increased latency. Using hashed strings for
the task ID or for the prefix of the task ID is recommended.
