.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR Create a Cloud Game Server Allocation Policy.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m

Allocation policy resource \- Cloud Game Server Allocation Policy to create. The
arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource.
(NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in
other ways. To set the [project] attribute: provide the argument
[allocation_policy] on the command line with a fully specified name; set the
property [core/project]; provide the argument [\-\-project] on the command line.
This must be specified.

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fIALLOCATION_POLICY\fR
ID of the allocation policy or fully qualified identifier for the allocation
policy. This positional must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
group are specified.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-location\fR=\fILOCATION\fR
Google Cloud location.

.SH "REQUIRED FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-priority\fR=\fIPRIORITY\fR
Priority of the Allocation Policy.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-weight\fR=\fIWEIGHT\fR
Relative weight of the Allocation Policy.

If there are multiple policies with the same priority, a policy will be selected
at random, where the probability of a given policy being selected is based on
its weight. For example, if there are two policies with priority 1, where policy
A has weight 100 and policy B has weight 300, policy A will be selected 25% of
the time, and policy B will be selected 75% of the time.

.SH "OPTIONAL FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-async\fR
Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to complete.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-labels\fR=[\fIKEY\fR=\fIVALUE\fR,...]
List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens (\f5\-\fR),
underscores (\f5_\fR), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must contain
only hyphens (\f5\-\fR), underscores (\f5_\fR), lowercase characters, and
numbers.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-match\-clusters\fR=[\fIKEY\fR=\fIVALUE\fR,...]
Labels to select clusters to which this Allocation Policy applies. This flag can
be repeated.

Example: $ gcloud alpha game servers allocation\-policies create \e
example\-policy \-\-match\-clusters=label_a=value1,label_b=value2 \e
\-\-match\-clusters=label_c=value3,label_d=value4

With the above command, this policy is applicable to clusters that have either
label_a=value1 and label_b=value2, or label_c=value3,label_d=value4.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-schedule\fR=\fISCHEDULE\fR
Event schedules. Schedules allow allocation policies to be adjusted for planned
events. For example, you can add policies to allocate from specific clusters
during an event. This flag can be repeated.

The following keys are allowed:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fBcron\-spec\fR
Cron definition of the scheduled event. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron.
The cron spec specification is in the local time as defined by the realm.
Requires cron\-job\-duration to be specified.

.TP 2m
\fBcron\-job\-duration\fR
Duration for the cron job event. The duration of the event is effective after
the cron job's start time. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on
duration formats. Required if cron\-spec is specified.

.TP 2m
\fBstart\-time\fR
Start time of the event. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on
duration formats. Either start\-time or cron\-spec should be specified.

.TP 2m
\fBend\-time\fR
End time of the event. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on duration
formats.

Example:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha game servers allocation\-policies create \e
    example\-policy \e
    \-\-schedule=start\-time=2019\-01\-01T00:00:01Z,\e
end\-time=2030\-01\-01T00:00:01Z,cron\-job\-duration=3600s,cron\-spec="10\e
