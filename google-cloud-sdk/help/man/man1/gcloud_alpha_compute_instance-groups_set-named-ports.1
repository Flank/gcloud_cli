gcloud alpha compute instance\-groups set\-named\-ports \- sets the list of named ports for an instance group



.SH "SYNOPSIS"

\f5gcloud alpha compute instance\-groups set\-named\-ports\fR \fINAME\fR \fB\-\-named\-ports\fR=[\fINAME\fR:\fIPORT\fR,...] [\fB\-\-region\fR=\fIREGION\fR\ |\ \fB\-\-zone\fR=\fIZONE\fR] [\fIGCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG\ ...\fR]



.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR Named ports are key:value pairs metadata representing the service
name and the port that it's running on. Named ports can be assigned to an
instance group, which indicates that the service is available on all instances
in the group. This information is used by the HTTP Load Balancing service.

\fBgcloud alpha compute instance\-groups set\-named\-ports\fR sets the list of
named ports for all instances in an instance group.

Note: Running this command will clear all existing named ports.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fINAME\fR
Name of the instance group to operate on.


.RE
.sp

.SH "REQUIRED FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-named\-ports\fR=[\fINAME\fR:\fIPORT\fR,...]
The comma\-separated list of key:value pairs representing the service name and
the port that it is running on.

To clear the list of named ports pass empty list as flag value. For example:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha compute instance\-groups set\-named\-ports \e
    example\-instance\-group \-\-named\-ports ""

.SH "OPTIONAL FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m

At most one of these may be specified:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-region\fR=\fIREGION\fR
Region of the instance group to operate on. If not specified, you may be
prompted to select a region.

A list of regions can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute regions list
.RE

Overrides the default \fBcompute/region\fR property value for this command
invocation.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-zone\fR=\fIZONE\fR
Zone of the instance group to operate on. If not specified, you may be prompted
to select a zone.

A list of zones can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute zones list
.RE

Overrides the default \fBcompute/zone\fR property value for this command
invocation.

.SH "GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS"

These flags are available to all commands: \-\-account, \-\-billing\-project,
\-\-configuration, \-\-flags\-file, \-\-flatten, \-\-format, \-\-help,
\-\-impersonate\-service\-account, \-\-log\-http, \-\-project, \-\-quiet,
\-\-trace\-token, \-\-user\-output\-enabled, \-\-verbosity.

Run \fB$ gcloud help\fR for details.



.SH "EXAMPLES"

For example, to apply the named ports to an entire instance group:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha compute instance\-groups set\-named\-ports \e
    example\-instance\-group \-\-named\-ports=example\-service:1111 \e
    \-\-zone=us\-central1\-a
.RE

The above example will assign a name 'example\-service' for port 1111 to the
instance group called 'example\-instance\-group' in the
\f5\fIus\-central1\-a\fR\fR zone. The command removes any named ports that are
already set for this instance group.

To clear named ports from instance group provide empty named ports list as
parameter:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha compute instance\-groups set\-named\-ports \e
    example\-instance\-group \-\-named\-ports="" \-\-zone=us\-central1\-a
.RE



.SH "NOTES"

This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right project,
you may be trying to access an API with an invitation\-only early access
allowlist. These variants are also available:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute instance\-groups set\-named\-ports
$ gcloud beta compute instance\-groups set\-named\-ports
