.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR This command replaces the existing IAM policy for a service, given
a service and a file encoded in JSON or YAML that contains the IAM policy. If
the given policy file specifies an "etag" value, then the replacement will
succeed only if the policy already in place matches that etag. (An etag obtain
via \f5get\-iam\-policy\fR will prevent the replacement if the policy for the
service has been subsequently updated.) A policy file that does not contain an
etag value will replace any existing policy for the service.

property [core/project]; provide the argument [\-\-project] on the command line.
To set the [region] attribute: provide the argument [service] on the command
line with a fully specified name; provide the argument [\-\-region] on the
command line; set the property [run/region]; specify from a list of available
regions in a prompt. This must be specified.
