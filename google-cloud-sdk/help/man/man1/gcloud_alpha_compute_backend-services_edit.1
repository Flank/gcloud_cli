.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR \fBgcloud alpha compute backend\-services edit\fR can be used to
modify a backend service. The backend service resource is fetched from the
server and presented in a text editor. After the file is saved and closed, this
command will update the resource. Only fields that can be modified are displayed
in the editor.

Backends are named by their associated instances groups, and one of the
\f5\fI\-\-group\fR\fR or \f5\fI\-\-instance\-group\fR\fR flags is required to
identify the backend that you are modifying. You cannot "change" the instance
group associated with a backend, but you can accomplish something similar with
\f5\fIbackend\-services remove\-backend\fR\fR and \f5\fIbackend\-services
add\-backend\fR\fR.

The editor used to modify the resource is chosen by inspecting the
\f5\fIEDITOR\fR\fR environment variable.
