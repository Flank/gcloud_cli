$ gcloud alpha active\-directory domains update \-\-clear\-labels
.RE

To set the labels to exactly "foo" and "baz":

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha active\-directory domains update \-\-clear\-labels \e
  \-\-update\-labels foo=bar,baz=qux
.RE

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-remove\-labels\fR=[\fIKEY\fR,...]
List of label keys to remove. If a label does not exist it is silently ignored.

.SH "API REFERENCE"

This command uses the \fBmanagedidentities/v1alpha1\fR API. The full
documentation for this API can be found at:
https://cloud.google.com/managed\-microsoft\-ad/



.SH "EXAMPLES"

The following command updates an AD domain with the name \f5my\-domain.com\fR to
add the two labels, \f5env\fR and \f5service\fR and to add a provisioned region
\f5us\-west1\fR:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha active\-directory domains update my\-domain.com \e
    \-\-update\-labels=env=test,service=foo \e
\-\-add\-region=us\-west1
.RE

This peers the domain \f5my\-domain.com\fR to the network \f5my\-network\fR.

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha active\-directory domains update my\-domain.com
\-\-add\-authorized\-networks=projects/my\-project/global/networks/my\-network
.RE



.SH "NOTES"

This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right project,
you may be trying to access an API with an invitation\-only early access
allowlist. These variants are also available:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud active\-directory domains update
$ gcloud beta active\-directory domains update
