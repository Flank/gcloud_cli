.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR Schedules a job to inspect content in a Google Cloud Storage
bucket for sensitive data.

See Inspecting Storage and Databases for Sensitive Data
(https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/inspecting\-storage) for more details.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fIPATH\fR
Google Cloud Storage URL to scan for files with optional wildcard character
(\f5*\fR) \-\- for example, gs://my\-bucket/\f5*\fR.


.RE

.SH "FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-exclude\-info\-types\fR
Whether or not to exclude type information of the findings. Type information is
included by default.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-file\-size\-limit\fR=\fIFILE_SIZE_LIMIT\fR; default=1024
Integer indicating max number of bytes to scan from a file. If a scanned file's
size is bigger than this value, then the rest of the bytes are omitted. The
default value is 1024.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-include\-quote\fR
If True, a contextual quote from the data that triggered a finding is included
in the response. Even if the content is not text, it may be converted to a
textual representation in the response. For example, given the input value 'My
phone number is (415) 555\-0890' and a search for the infoType PHONE_NUMBER, the
contextual quote would be '(415) 555\-0890.'

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-info\-types\fR=[\fIINFOTYPE\fR,...]
Which infoTypes to scan input for. The values must correspond to infoType values
found in documentation. For more information about valid infoTypes, see
infoTypes Reference (https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/infotypes\-reference)

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-job\-id\fR=\fIJOB_ID\fR
Optional job ID to use for the created job. If not provided, a job ID will
automatically be generated. Must be unique within the project. The job ID can
contain uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens; that is, it must
match the regular expression: \f5[a\-zA\-Z\e\ed\-]+\fR. The maximum length is
100 characters. Can be empty to allow the system to generate one.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-max\-findings\fR=\fIMAX_FINDINGS\fR
Maximum number of findings that will be returned per execution.

If not specified, no limits are applied.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-max\-findings\-per\-item\fR=\fIMAX_FINDINGS_PER_ITEM\fR
Maximum number of findings that will be returned for each item scanned.

If not specified, no limits are applied.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-max\-time\fR=\fIMAX_TIME\fR
Scan will include items in repository whose age is >= min\-time and <=
max\-time.

If max\-time is omitted then there is no maximum time limit.

See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on time formats.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-min\-likelihood\fR=\fIMIN_LIKELIHOOD\fR; default="possible"
Only return findings equal to or above this threshold. \fIMIN_LIKELIHOOD\fR must
be one of: \fBlikely\fR, \fBpossible\fR, \fBunlikely\fR, \fBvery\-likely\fR,
\fBvery\-unlikely\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-min\-time\fR=\fIMIN_TIME\fR
Scan will include items in repository whose age is >= min\-time and <=
max\-time.

If max\-time is omitted then there is no maximum time limit.

See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on time formats.

.TP 2m

At most one of these may be specified:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-output\-table\fR=\fIOUTPUT_TABLE\fR
Publishes results of a Cloud DLP job a BigQuery table. BigQuery tables are
uniquely identified by their project_id, dataset_id, and table_id in the format
\f5<project_id>.<dataset_id>.<table_id>\fR or
\f5<project_id>.<dataset_id>.<table_id>\fR. If no table_id is specified, DLP
will create a table for you.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-output\-topics\fR=[\fIOUTPUT_TOPICS\fR,...]
Publishes the results of a Cloud DLP job to one or more Cloud Pub/Sub topics.

Note: The topic must have given publishing access rights to the DLP API service
account executing the Cloud DLP job.
