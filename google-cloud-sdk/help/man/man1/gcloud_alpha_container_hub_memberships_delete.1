.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR This command deletes the Hub membership resource corresponding to
the cluster.

This command is intended to delete stale Hub Membership resources as doing so on
a fully registered cluster will skip uninstalling the Connect Agent and and
orphan in\-cluster resources and agent connections to Google. To completely
unregister the cluster, consider using the command: \f5gcloud alpha container
hub memberships unregister\fR.
