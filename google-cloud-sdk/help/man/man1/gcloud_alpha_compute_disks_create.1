.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR \fBgcloud alpha compute disks create\fR creates one or more
Compute Engine persistent disks. When creating virtual machine instances, disks
can be attached to the instances through the \f5gcloud compute instances
create\fR command. Disks can also be attached to instances that are already
running using \f5gcloud compute instances attach\-disk\fR.

Disks are zonal resources, so they reside in a particular zone for their entire
lifetime. The contents of a disk can be moved to a different zone by
snapshotting the disk (using \f5gcloud compute disks snapshot\fR) and creating a
new disk using \f5\-\-source\-snapshot\fR in the desired zone. The contents of a
disk can also be moved across project or zone by creating an image (using
\f5gcloud compute images create\fR) and creating a new disk using
\f5\-\-image\fR in the desired project and/or zone.

For a comprehensive guide, including details on minimum and maximum disk size,
refer to: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-csek\-key\-file\fR=\fIFILE\fR
Path to a Customer\-Supplied Encryption Key (CSEK) key file, mapping Google
Compute Engine resources to user managed keys to be used when creating,
mounting, or snapshotting disks.

If you pass \f5\-\fR as value of the flag the CSEK will be read from stdin. See
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer\-supplied\-encryption for
more details.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-description\fR=\fIDESCRIPTION\fR
An optional, textual description for the disks being created.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-erase\-windows\-vss\-signature\fR
Specifies whether the disk restored from a source snapshot should erase Windows
specific VSS signature. See
https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/compute/disks/snapshot#\-\-guest\-flush

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-guest\-os\-features\fR=[\fIGUEST_OS_FEATURE\fR,...]
This parameter enables one or more features for VM instances that use the image
for their boot disks. See
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/create\-delete\-deprecate\-private\-images#guest\-os\-features
for descriptions of the supported features. \fIGUEST_OS_FEATURE\fR must be one
of: \fBBARE_METAL_LINUX_COMPATIBLE\fR, \fBGVNIC\fR, \fBMULTI_IP_SUBNET\fR,
\fBSEV_CAPABLE\fR, \fBUEFI_COMPATIBLE\fR, \fBVIRTIO_SCSI_MULTIQUEUE\fR,
\fBWINDOWS\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-interface\fR=\fIINTERFACE\fR
Specifies the disk interface to use for attaching this disk. Valid values are
\f5SCSI\fR and \f5NVME\fR. The default is \f5SCSI\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-labels\fR=[\fIKEY\fR=\fIVALUE\fR,...]
List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens (\f5\-\fR),
underscores (\f5_\fR), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must contain
only hyphens (\f5\-\fR), underscores (\f5_\fR), lowercase characters, and
numbers.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-licenses\fR=[\fILICENSE\fR,...]
A list of URIs to license resources. The provided licenses will be added onto
the created disks to indicate the licensing and billing policies.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-multi\-writer\fR
Create the disk in multi\-writer mode so that it can be attached with
read\-write access to multiple VMs. Can only be used with zonal SSD persistent
disks. Disks in multi\-writer mode do not support resize and snapshot
operations.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-physical\-block\-size\fR=\fIPHYSICAL_BLOCK_SIZE\fR; default="4096"
Physical block size of the persistent disk in bytes. Valid values are
4096(default) and 16384. \fIPHYSICAL_BLOCK_SIZE\fR must be one of: \fB4096\fR,
\fB16384\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-provisioned\-iops\fR=\fIPROVISIONED_IOPS\fR
Provisioned IOPS of pd\-extreme disk to create. If specified, the value must be
in the range between 10000 and 120000. If not specified, the default value is
100000.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-replica\-zones\fR=\fIZONE\fR,\fIZONE\fR
A comma\-separated list of exactly 2 zones that a regional disk will be
replicated to. Required when creating regional disk. The zones must be in the
same region as specified in the \f5\-\-region\fR flag. See available zones with
\f5gcloud compute zones list\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-require\-csek\-key\-create\fR
Refuse to create resources not protected by a user managed key in the key file
when \-\-csek\-key\-file is given. This behavior is enabled by default to
prevent incorrect gcloud invocations from accidentally creating resources with
no user managed key. Disabling the check allows creation of some resources
without a matching Customer\-Supplied Encryption Key in the supplied
\-\-csek\-key\-file. See
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer\-supplied\-encryption for
more details. Enabled by default, use \fB\-\-no\-require\-csek\-key\-create\fR
to disable.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-resource\-policies\fR=[\fIRESOURCE_POLICY\fR,...]
A list of resource policy names to be added to the disk. The policies must exist
in the same region as the disk.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-size\fR=\fISIZE\fR
Size of the disks. The value must be a whole number followed by a size unit of
\f5\fIGB\fR\fR for gigabyte, or \f5\fITB\fR\fR for terabyte. If no size unit is
specified, GB is assumed. For example, \f5\fI10GB\fR\fR will produce 10 gigabyte
disks. Disk size must be a multiple of 1 GB. Limit your boot disk size to 2TB to
account for MBR partition table limitations. If disk size is not specified, the
default size of 500GB for pd\-standard disks, 100GB for pd\-balanced disks, and
100GB for pd\-ssd disks will be used. For details about disk size limits, refer
to: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-type\fR=\fITYPE\fR
Specifies the type of disk to create. To get a list of available disk types, run
\f5gcloud compute disk\-types list\fR. The default disk type is pd\-standard.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-image\-project\fR=\fIIMAGE_PROJECT\fR
The Google Cloud project against which all image and image family references
will be resolved. It is best practice to define image\-project. A full list of
available projects can be generated by running \f5gcloud projects list\fR.
.RS 2m
.IP "\(em" 2m
If specifying one of our public images, image\-project must be provided.
.IP "\(em" 2m
If there are several of the same image\-family value in multiple projects,
image\-project must be specified to clarify the image to be used.

.TP 2m

At most one of these may be specified:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-image\fR=\fIIMAGE\fR
An image to apply to the disks being created. When using this option, the size
of the disks must be at least as large as the image size. Use
\f5\fI\-\-size\fR\fR to adjust the size of the disks.

This flag is mutually exclusive with \f5\fI\-\-source\-snapshot\fR\fR and
\f5\fI\-\-image\-family\fR\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-image\-family\fR=\fIIMAGE_FAMILY\fR
The image family for the operating system that the boot disk will be initialized
with. Compute Engine offers multiple Linux distributions, some of which are
available as both regular and Shielded VM images. When a family is specified
instead of an image, the latest non\-deprecated image associated with that
family is used. It is best practice to use \-\-image\-family when the latest
version of an image is needed.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-source\-disk\fR=\fISOURCE_DISK\fR
Source disk used to create the disks. It is safe to delete a source disk after a
disk has been created from the source disk. To get a list of disks in your
current project, run \f5gcloud compute disks list\fR. This flag is mutually
exclusive with \fB\-\-image\fR and \fB\-\-source\-snapshot\fR.

When using this option, the size of the disks must be at least as large as the
source disk size. Use \fB\-\-size\fR to adjust the size of the disks.

Source disk must be in the same zone/region as the disk to be created.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-source\-instant\-snapshot\fR=\fISOURCE_INSTANT_SNAPSHOT\fR
Source instant snapshot used to create the disks.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-source\-snapshot\fR=\fISOURCE_SNAPSHOT\fR
Source snapshot used to create the disks. It is safe to delete a snapshot after
a disk has been created from the snapshot. In such cases, the disks will no
longer reference the deleted snapshot. To get a list of snapshots in your
current project, run \f5gcloud compute snapshots list\fR. A snapshot from an
existing disk can be created using the \f5gcloud compute disks snapshot\fR
command. This flag is mutually exclusive with \fB\-\-image\fR.

When using this option, the size of the disks must be at least as large as the
snapshot size. Use \fB\-\-size\fR to adjust the size of the disks.
