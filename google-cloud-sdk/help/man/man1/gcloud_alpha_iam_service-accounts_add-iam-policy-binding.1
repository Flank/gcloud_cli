.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR Add an IAM policy binding to an IAM service account. A binding
consists of at least one member, a role, and an optional condition.

When managing IAM roles, you can treat a service account either as a resource or
as an identity. This command adds an IAM policy binding to a service account
resource. There are other gcloud commands to manage IAM policies for other types
of resources. For example, to manage IAM policies on a project, use the $ gcloud
projects commands.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m

ServiceAccount resource \- The Service Account to which to add the IAM policy
binding. This represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the [project]
attribute: provide the argument [service_account] on the command line with a
fully specified name; set the property [core/project]; provide the argument
[\-\-project] on the command line. This must be specified.

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fISERVICE_ACCOUNT\fR

At most one of these may be specified:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-condition\fR=[\fIKEY\fR=\fIVALUE\fR,...]

The condition of the binding to be added. When the condition is explicitly
specified as \f5None\fR (\f5\-\-condition=None\fR), a binding without a
condition is added. When the condition is specified and is not \f5None\fR,
\f5\-\-role\fR cannot be a primitive role. Primitive roles are
\f5roles/editor\fR, \f5roles/owner\fR, and \f5roles/viewer\fR.

.TP 2m
\fBexpression\fR
(Required) Expression of the condition which evaluates to True or False. This
uses a subset of Common Expression Language syntax.

.TP 2m
\fBtitle\fR
(Required) A short string describing the purpose of the expression.

.TP 2m
\fBdescription\fR
(Optional) Additional description for the expression.

NOTE: An unsatisfied condition will not allow access via this binding.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-condition\-from\-file\fR=\fICONDITION_FROM_FILE\fR
Path to a local JSON or YAML file that defines the condition. To see available
fields, see the help for \f5\-\-condition\fR.
