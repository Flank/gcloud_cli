.SH "OPTIONAL FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-export\-custom\-routes\fR
If set, the network will export custom routes to peer network. Use
\-\-no\-export\-custom\-routes to disable it.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-export\-subnet\-routes\-with\-public\-ip\fR
If set, the network will export subnet routes with addresses in the public IP
ranges to peer network. Use \-\-no\-export\-subnet\-routes\-with\-public\-ip to
disable it.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-import\-custom\-routes\fR
If set, the network will import custom routes from peer network. Use
\-\-no\-import\-custom\-routes to disable it.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-import\-subnet\-routes\-with\-public\-ip\fR
If set, the network will import subnet routes with addresses in the public IP
ranges from peer network. Use \-\-no\-import\-subnet\-routes\-with\-public\-ip

.SH "EXAMPLES"

To update the peering named peering\-name to both export and import custom
routes, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha compute networks peerings update peering\-name \e
  \-\-export\-custom\-routes \e
  \-\-import\-custom\-routes
.RE


To update the peering named peering\-name to both export and import subnet
routes with public ip, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha compute networks peerings update peering\-name \e
  \-\-export\-subnet\-routes\-with\-public\-ip \e
  \-\-import\-subnet\-routes\-with\-public\-ip

.SH "NOTES"

This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right project,
you may be trying to access an API with an invitation\-only early access
allowlist. These variants are also available:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute networks peerings update
$ gcloud beta compute networks peerings update
