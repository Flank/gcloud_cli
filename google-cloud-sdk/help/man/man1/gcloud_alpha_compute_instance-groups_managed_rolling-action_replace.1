.SH "FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-max\-surge\fR=\fIMAX_SURGE\fR
Maximum additional number of instances that can be created during the update
process. This can be a fixed number (e.g. 5) or a percentage of size to the
managed instance group (e.g. 10%)

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-max\-unavailable\fR=\fIMAX_UNAVAILABLE\fR
Maximum number of instances that can be unavailable during the update process.
This can be a fixed number (e.g. 5) or a percentage of size to the managed
instance group (e.g. 10%)

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-min\-ready\fR=\fIMIN_READY\fR
Minimum time for which a newly created instance should be ready to be considered
available. For example \f510s\fR for 10 seconds. See $ gcloud topic datetimes
for information on duration formats.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-replacement\-method\fR=\fIREPLACEMENT_METHOD\fR
Type of replacement method. Specifies what action will be taken to update
instances. \fIREPLACEMENT_METHOD\fR must be one of:

.RS 2m
