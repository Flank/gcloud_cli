\fB\-\-database\-flags\fR=\fIFLAG\fR=\fIVALUE\fR,[\fIFLAG\fR=\fIVALUE\fR,...]
A comma\-separated list of database flags to set on the instance. Use an equals
sign to separate flag name and value. Flags without values, like
skip_grant_tables, can be written out without a value after, e.g.,
\f5skip_grant_tables=\fR. Use on/off for booleans. View the Instance Resource
API for allowed flags. (e.g., \f5\-\-database\-flags
max_allowed_packet=55555,skip_grant_tables=,log_output=1\fR)

Specified if binary log should be enabled. If backup configuration is disabled,
binary log must be disabled as well.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-failover\-replica\-name\fR=\fIFAILOVER_REPLICA_NAME\fR
Also create a failover replica with the specified name.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-follow\-gae\-app\fR=\fIFOLLOW_GAE_APP\fR
First Generation instances only. The App Engine app this instance should follow.
It must be in the same region as the instance.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-gce\-zone\fR=\fIGCE_ZONE\fR
The preferred Compute Engine zone (e.g. us\-central1\-a, us\-central1\-b, etc.).

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-maintenance\-release\-channel\fR=\fIMAINTENANCE_RELEASE_CHANNEL\fR
Which channel's updates to apply during the maintenance window. If not
specified, Cloud SQL chooses the timing of updates to your instance.
\fIMAINTENANCE_RELEASE_CHANNEL\fR must be one of:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fBpreview\fR
Preview updates release prior to production updates. You may wish to use the
preview channel for dev/test applications so that you can preview their
compatibility with your application prior to the production release.
.TP 2m
\fBproduction\fR
Production updates are stable and recommended for applications in production.

.RE
.sp
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-maintenance\-window\-day\fR=\fIMAINTENANCE_WINDOW_DAY\fR

newly created instance will be a read replica of the specified master instance.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-memory\fR=\fIMEMORY\fR
A whole number value indicating how much memory is desired in the machine. A
size unit should be provided (eg. 3072MiB or 9GiB) \- if no units are specified,
GiB is assumed. Both \-\-cpu and \-\-memory must be specified if a custom
machine type is desired, and the \-\-tier flag must be omitted.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-pricing\-plan\fR=\fIPRICING_PLAN\fR, \fB\-p\fR \fIPRICING_PLAN\fR; default="PER_USE"
First Generation instances only. The pricing plan for this instance.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-require\-ssl\fR
Specified if users connecting over IP must use SSL.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-storage\-auto\-increase\fR
Storage size can be increased, but it cannot be decreased; storage increases are
permanent for the life of the instance. With this setting enabled, a spike in
storage requirements can result in permanently increased storage costs for your
instance. However, if an instance runs out of available space, it can result in
the instance going offline, dropping existing connections. This setting is
enabled by default.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-storage\-size\fR=\fISTORAGE_SIZE\fR
Amount of storage allocated to the instance. Must be an integer number of GB
between 10GB and 10230GB inclusive. The default is 10GB.

\fB\-\-storage\-type\fR=\fISTORAGE_TYPE\fR
The storage type for the instance. The default is SSD. \fISTORAGE_TYPE\fR must
be one of: \fBSSD\fR, \fBHDD\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-tier\fR=\fITIER\fR, \fB\-t\fR \fITIER\fR
The tier for this instance. For Second Generation instances, TIER is the
instance's machine type (e.g., db\-n1\-standard\-1). For PostgreSQL instances,
only shared\-core machine types (e.g., db\-f1\-micro) apply. The default tier is
db\-n1\-standard\-1. A complete list of tiers is available here:
