.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR \fBgcloud alpha compute backend\-services create\fR is used to
create backend services. Backend services define groups of backends that can
receive traffic. Each backend group has parameters that define the group's
capacity (e.g. max CPU utilization, max queries per second, ...). URL maps
define which requests are sent to which backend services.

Backend services created through this command will start out without any backend
groups. To add backend groups, use 'gcloud compute backend\-services
add\-backend' or 'gcloud compute backend\-services edit'.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fIBACKEND_SERVICE_NAME\fR
Name of the backend service to create.


.RE
.sp

.SH "FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-affinity\-cookie\-ttl\fR=\fIAFFINITY_COOKIE_TTL\fR
If session\-affinity is set to "generated_cookie", this flag sets the TTL, in
seconds, of the resulting cookie. A setting of 0 indicates that the cookie
should be transient. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on duration
formats.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-cache\-key\-include\-host\fR
Enable including host in cache key. If enabled, requests to different hosts will
be cached separately. Can only be applied for global resources. Enabled by
default, use \fB\-\-no\-cache\-key\-include\-host\fR to disable.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-cache\-key\-include\-protocol\fR
Enable including protocol in cache key. If enabled, http and https requests will
be cached separately. Can only be applied for global resources. Enabled by
default, use \fB\-\-no\-cache\-key\-include\-protocol\fR to disable.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-cache\-key\-include\-query\-string\fR
Enable including query string in cache key. If enabled, the query string
parameters will be included according to
\-\-cache\-key\-query\-string\-whitelist and
\-\-cache\-key\-query\-string\-blacklist. If neither is set, the entire query
string will be included. If disabled, then the entire query string will be
excluded. Can only be applied for global resources. Enabled by default, use
\fB\-\-no\-cache\-key\-include\-query\-string\fR to disable.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-connection\-drain\-on\-failover\fR
Connection drain is enabled by default and on failover or failback connections
will be drained. If connection drain is disabled, the existing connection state
will be cleared immediately on a best effort basis on failover or failback, all
connections will then be served by the active pool of instances. Not compatible
with the \-\-global flag, load balancing scheme must be INTERNAL, and the
protocol must be TCP.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-connection\-draining\-timeout\fR=\fICONNECTION_DRAINING_TIMEOUT\fR
Connection draining timeout to be used during removal of VMs from instance
groups. This guarantees that for the specified time all existing connections to
a VM will remain untouched, but no new connections will be accepted. Set timeout
to zero to disable connection draining. Enable feature by specifying a timeout
of up to one hour. If the flag is omitted API default value (0s) will be used.
See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on duration formats.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-custom\-request\-header\fR=\fICUSTOM_REQUEST_HEADER\fR
Specifies a HTTP Header to be added by your load balancer. This flag can be
repeated to specify multiple headers. For example:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha compute backend\-services create NAME             \e
    \-\-custom\-request\-header "header\-name: value"             \e
    \-\-custom\-request\-header "another\-header:"
.RE

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-description\fR=\fIDESCRIPTION\fR
An optional, textual description for the backend service.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-drop\-traffic\-if\-unhealthy\fR
Enable dropping of traffic if there are no healthy VMs detected in both the
primary and backup instance groups. Not compatible with the \-\-global flag and
load balancing scheme must be INTERNAL.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-enable\-cdn\fR
Enable Cloud CDN for the backend service. Cloud CDN can cache HTTP responses
from a backend service at the edge of the network, close to users. Cloud CDN is
disabled by default.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-enable\-logging\fR
The logging options for the load balancer traffic served by this backend
service. If logging is enabled, logs will be exported to Stackdriver. Enabled by
default.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-failover\-ratio\fR=\fIFAILOVER_RATIO\fR
If the ratio of the healthy VMs in the primary backend is at or below this
number, traffic arriving at the load\-balanced IP will be directed to the
failover backend(s). Not compatible with the \-\-global flag.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-health\-checks\fR=\fIHEALTH_CHECK\fR,[...]
Specifies a list of health check objects for checking the health of the backend
service. Currently at most one health check can be specified. Health checks need
not be for the same protocol as that of the backend service.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-http\-health\-checks\fR=\fIHTTP_HEALTH_CHECK\fR,[...]
Specifies a list of legacy HTTP health check objects for checking the health of
the backend service.

Legacy health checks are not recommended for backend services. It is possible to
use a legacy health check on a backend service for a HTTP(S) load balancer if
that backend service uses instance groups. For more information, see this guide:
https://cloud.google.com/load\-balancing/docs/health\-check\-concepts#lb_guide

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-https\-health\-checks\fR=\fIHTTPS_HEALTH_CHECK\fR,[...]
Specifies a list of legacy HTTPS health check objects for checking the health of
the backend service.

Legacy health checks are not recommended for backend services. It is possible to
use a legacy health check on a backend service for a HTTP(S) load balancer if
that backend service uses instance groups. For more information, see this guide:
https://cloud.google.com/load\-balancing/docs/health\-check\-concepts#lb_guide

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-iap\fR=\fIdisabled\fR|\fIenabled\fR,[\fIoauth2\-client\-id\fR=\fIOAUTH2\-CLIENT\-ID\fR,\fIoauth2\-client\-secret\fR=\fIOAUTH2\-CLIENT\-SECRET\fR]
Configure Identity Aware Proxy (IAP) service. You can configure IAP to be
\'enabled' or 'disabled' (default). If it is enabled you can provide values for
\'oauth2\-client\-id' and 'oauth2\-client\-secret'. For example,
\'\-\-iap=enabled,oauth2\-client\-id=foo,oauth2\-client\-secret=bar' will turn
IAP on, and '\-\-iap=disabled' will turn it off. See
https://cloud.google.com/iap/ for more information about this feature.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-load\-balancing\-scheme\fR=\fILOAD_BALANCING_SCHEME\fR; default="EXTERNAL"
Specifies if this is internal or external load balancer.
\fILOAD_BALANCING_SCHEME\fR must be one of: \fBINTERNAL\fR, \fBEXTERNAL\fR,
\fBINTERNAL_MANAGED\fR, \fBINTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-logging\-sample\-rate\fR=\fILOGGING_SAMPLE_RATE\fR
This field can only be specified if logging is enabled for the backend service.
The value of the field must be a float in the range [0, 1]. This configures the
sampling rate of requests to the load balancer where 1.0 means all logged
requests are reported and 0.0 means no logged requests are reported. The default
value is 1.0.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-port\-name\fR=\fIPORT_NAME\fR
The name of a service that has been added to an instance group in this backend.
Instance group services map a name to a port number which is used by the load
balancing service. Only one \f5\fIport\-name\fR\fR may be added to a backend
service, and that name must exist as a service on all instance groups that are a
part of this backend service. The port number associated with the name may
differ between instances. If you do not specify this flag, your instance groups
must have a service named \f5\fIhttp\fR\fR configured. See also \f5gcloud
compute instance\-groups set\-named\-ports \-\-help\fR. The
\f5\fIport\-name\fR\fR parameter cannot be set if the load\-balancing\-scheme is
INTERNAL.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-protocol\fR=\fIPROTOCOL\fR
Protocol for incoming requests.

If the load\-balancing\-scheme is \f5INTERNAL\fR, the protocol must be one of:
\f5TCP\fR, \f5UDP\fR.

If the load\-balancing\-scheme is \f5EXTERNAL\fR, the protocol must be one of:
\f5HTTP\fR, \f5HTTPS\fR, \f5HTTP2\fR, \f5SSL\fR, \f5TCP\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-session\-affinity\fR=\fISESSION_AFFINITY\fR
The type of TCP session affinity to use. Not supported for UDP.
\fISESSION_AFFINITY\fR must be one of:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fBCLIENT_IP\fR
Route requests to instances based on the hash of the client's IP address.
.TP 2m
\fBCLIENT_IP_PORT_PROTO\fR
(Applicable if load\-balancing scheme is internal) Connections from the same
client IP with the same IP protocol and port will go to the same VM in the
backend while that VM remains healthy.
.TP 2m
\fBCLIENT_IP_PROTO\fR
(Applicable if load\-balancing scheme is internal) Connections from the same
client IP with the same IP protocol will go to the same VM in the pool while
that VM remains healthy.
.TP 2m
\fBGENERATED_COOKIE\fR
(Applicable if load\-balancing scheme is external) Route requests to instances
based on the contents of the "GCLB" cookie set by the load balancer.
.TP 2m
\fBNONE\fR
Session affinity is disabled.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-signed\-url\-cache\-max\-age\fR=\fISIGNED_URL_CACHE_MAX_AGE\fR
The amount of time up to which the response to a signed URL request will be
cached in the CDN. After this time period, the Signed URL will be revalidated
before being served. Cloud CDN will internally act as though all responses from
this backend had a \f5Cache\-Control: public, max\-age=[TTL]\fR header,
regardless of any existing Cache\-Control header. The actual headers served in
responses will not be altered. If unspecified, the default value is 3600s.

For example, specifying \f512h\fR will cause the responses to signed URL
requests to be cached in the CDN up to 12 hours. See $ gcloud topic datetimes
for information on duration formats.

This flag only affects signed URL requests.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-timeout\fR=\fITIMEOUT\fR; default="30s"
Only applicable to HTTP(S), SSL Proxy, and TCP Proxy load balancers: The amount
of time to wait for a backend to return a full response for the request and for
the load balancer to proxy the response to the client before considering the
request failed.

For example, specifying 10s gives instances 10 seconds to respond to requests.
The load balancer will retry GET requests once if the backend closes the
connection or times out before sending response headers to the proxy. If the
backend produces any response headers, the load balancer does not retry. If the
backend does not reply at all, the load balancer returns a 502 Bad Gateway error
to the client. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on duration formats.

This parameter has no effect if the load\-balancing\-scheme is INTERNAL.

.TP 2m

At most one of these may be specified:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-cache\-key\-query\-string\-blacklist\fR=[\fIQUERY_STRING\fR,...]
Specifies a comma separated list of query string parameters to exclude in cache
keys. All other parameters will be included. Either specify
\-\-cache\-key\-query\-string\-whitelist or
\-\-cache\-key\-query\-string\-blacklist, not both. '&' and '=' will be percent
encoded and not treated as delimiters. Can only be applied for global resources.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-cache\-key\-query\-string\-whitelist\fR=\fIQUERY_STRING\fR,[...]
Specifies a comma separated list of query string parameters to include in cache
keys. All other parameters will be excluded. Either specify
\-\-cache\-key\-query\-string\-whitelist or
\-\-cache\-key\-query\-string\-blacklist, not both. '&' and '=' will be percent
encoded and not treated as delimiters. Can only be applied for global resources.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-global\-health\-checks\fR
If set, the health checks are global.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-health\-checks\-region\fR=\fIHEALTH_CHECKS_REGION\fR
Region of the health checks to operate on. If not specified, you may be prompted
to select a region.

To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
\f5\fIcompute/region\fR\fR property:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config set compute/region REGION
