.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR \fBgcloud alpha compute instance\-groups managed
create\-instance\fR creates a virtual machine instance with a defined name and
optionally its stateful configuration: stateful disk and stateful metadata
key\-values. Stateful configuration is stored in the corresponding newly created
per\-instance config. An instance with a per\-instance config will preserve its
given name, specified disks, and specified metadata key\-values during instance
recreation, auto\-healing, and updates and any other lifecycle transitions of
the instance.

\fB\-\-stateful\-disk\fR=[\fIauto\-delete\fR=\fIAUTO\-DELETE\fR],[\fIdevice\-name\fR=\fIDEVICE\-NAME\fR],[\fImode\fR=\fIMODE\fR],[\fIsource\fR=\fISOURCE\fR]
Disks considered stateful by the instance group. Managed instance groups
preserve and reattach stateful disks on VM autohealing, update, and recreate
events.

You can also attach and preserve disks, not defined in the group's instance
template, to a given instance.

The same disk can be attached to more than one instance but only in read\-only
mode.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-stateful\-metadata\fR=\fIKEY\fR=\fIVALUE\fR,[\fIKEY\fR=\fIVALUE\fR,...]
Additional metadata to be made available to the guest operating system in
addition to the metadata defined in the instance template.

Stateful metadata may be used to define a key/value pair specific for the one
given instance to differentiate it from the other instances in the managed
instance group.

Stateful metadata key/value pairs are preserved on instance recreation,
autohealing, updates, and any other lifecycle transitions of the instance.

Stateful metadata have priority over the metadata defined in the instance
template. This means that stateful metadata that is defined for a key that
already exists in the instance template overrides the instance template value.

Each metadata entry is a key/value pair separated by an equals sign. Metadata
keys must be unique and less than 128 bytes in length. Multiple entries can be
passed to this flag, e.g., \f5\fI\-\-stateful\-metadata
key\-1=value\-1,key\-2=value\-2,key\-3=value\-3\fR\fR.

.TP 2m

At most one of these may be specified:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-region\fR=\fIREGION\fR
Region of the managed instance group to create instance in. If not specified,
you may be prompted to select a region.

A list of regions can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute regions list
.RE

Overrides the default \fBcompute/region\fR property value for this command
invocation.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-zone\fR=\fIZONE\fR
Zone of the managed instance group to create instance in. If not specified, you
may be prompted to select a zone.

A list of zones can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute zones list
.RE

Overrides the default \fBcompute/zone\fR property value for this command
invocation.
