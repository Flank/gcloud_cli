.SH "DESCRIPTION"

gcloud container clusters get\-credentials updates a kubeconfig file with
appropriate credentials and endpoint information to point kubectl at a specific
cluster in Google Kubernetes Engine. It takes a project and a zone as
parameters, passed through by set defaults or flags. By default, credentials are
written to HOME/.kube/config. You can provide an alternate path by setting the
KUBECONFIG environment variable.

This command enables switching to a specific cluster, when working with multiple
clusters. It can also be used to access a previously created cluster from a new
workstation.

See https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes\-engine/docs/kubectl for kubectl
documentation.
