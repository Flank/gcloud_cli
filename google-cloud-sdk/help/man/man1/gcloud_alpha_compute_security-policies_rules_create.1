.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR \fBgcloud alpha compute security\-policies rules create\fR is used
to create security policy rules.

For example to create a rule at priority 1000 to block the IP range 1.2.3.0/24,
run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha compute security\-policies rules create 1000 \e
    \-\-action deny\-403 \e
    \-\-security\-policy my\-policy \e
    \-\-description "block 1.2.3.0/24" \e
    \-\-src\-ip\-ranges 1.2.3.0/24
