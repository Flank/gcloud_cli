.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR If the SOURCE is a directory, it and its contents are are exported
recursively. If no SOURCE is provided, the entire contents of the environment's

file to overwrite it, it is untouched.



.SH "REQUIRED FLAGS"

\fB\-\-destination\fR=\fIDESTINATION\fR

which to export files.

.TP 2m

Environment resource \- The environment from whose Cloud Storage bucket to
export plugins.. The arguments in this group can be used to specify the
attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in
this group but can be set in other ways. To set the [project] attribute: provide
the argument [\-\-environment] on the command line with a fully specified name;
provide the argument [\-\-project] on the command line; set the property

.SH "EXAMPLES"

Suppose the environment \f5myenv\fR's Cloud Storage bucket has the following
structure:

.RS 2m
gs://the\-bucket
|
+\-\- plugins
|   |
|   +\-\- file1.py
|   +\-\- file2.py
|   |
|   +\-\- subdir1
|   |   |
|   |   +\-\- file3.py
|   |   +\-\- file4.py
.RE

And the local directory '/foo' has the following structure:

.RS 2m
/foo
|
+\-\- file1.py
+\-\- fileX.py
|   |
|   +\-\- subdir1
|   |   |
|   |   +\-\- file3.py
|   |   +\-\- fileY.py
.RE

The following command:

.RS 2m
gcloud alpha composer environments storage plugins export myenv \-\-destination=/foo
.RE

would result in the following structure in the local '/foo' directory:

.RS 2m
/foo
|
+\-\- file1.py
+\-\- file2.py
+\-\- fileX.py
|   |
|   +\-\- subdir1
|   |   |
|   |   +\-\- file3.py
|   |   +\-\- file4.py
|   |   +\-\- fileY.py
.RE

The local files '/foo/file1.py' and '/foo/subdir1/file3.py' will be overwritten
with the contents of the corresponding files in the Cloud Storage bucket.

If instead we had run

.RS 2m
gcloud alpha composer environments storage plugins export myenv file2.py subdir1/file3.py \-\-destination=/foo
.RE

the resulting local directory structure would be the following:

.RS 2m
/foo
|
+\-\- file1.py
+\-\- file3.py
+\-\- fileX.py
|   |
|   +\-\- subdir1
|   |   |
|   |   +\-\- file3.py
|   |   +\-\- fileY.py
.RE

No local files would be overwritten since
\'gs://the\-bucket/dags/subdir1/file3.py' was written to '/foo/file3.py' instead
of 'foo/subdir1/file3.py'.



.SH "NOTES"

This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right project,
you may be trying to access an API with an invitation\-only early access
allowlist. These variants are also available:

.RS 2m

$ gcloud beta composer environments storage plugins export
