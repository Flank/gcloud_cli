.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR Revokes credentials for the specified user accounts or service
accounts.

When given a user account, this command revokes the user account token on the
server. If the revocation is successful, or if the token has already been
revoked, this command removes the credential from the local machine.

When given a service account, this command does not revoke the service account
token on the server because service account tokens are not revocable. Instead,
it will print a warning and remove the credential from the local machine.

If no account is specified, this command revokes credentials for the currently
active account, effectively logging out of that account. If \-\-all is given,
the behaviors described above apply individually to each account in the list.

You can revoke credentials when you want to prevent gcloud and other Cloud SDK
tools from using the specified account. You do not need to revoke credentials to
switch between accounts.
