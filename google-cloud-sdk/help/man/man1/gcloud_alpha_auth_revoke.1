.SH "SYNOPSIS"

\f5gcloud alpha auth revoke\fR [\fIACCOUNTS\fR\ ...] [\fB\-\-all\fR] [\fIGCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG\ ...\fR]



.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR Revokes credentials for the specified user accounts or service
accounts. When you revoke the credentials, they are removed from the local
machine. If no account is specified, this command revokes credentials for the
currently active account, effectively logging out of that account.

You can revoke credentials when you want to disallow access by gcloud and other
Cloud SDK tools using a specified account. You don't need to revoke credentials
to switch between accounts.
