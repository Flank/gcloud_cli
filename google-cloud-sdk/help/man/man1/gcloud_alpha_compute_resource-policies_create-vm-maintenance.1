\fB\-\-daily\-window\fR
Maintenance activity window starts daily at START_TIME. This flag must be
specified if any of the other arguments in this group are specified.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-start\-time\fR=\fISTART_TIME\fR
Start time of a four\-hour window in which maintenance should start in daily
cadence. Valid choices are 00:00, 04:00, 08:00,12:00, 16:00 and 20:00 UTC. For

.SH "OPTIONAL FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-description\fR=\fIDESCRIPTION\fR
An optional, textual description for the backend.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-region\fR=\fIREGION\fR
Region of the resource policy to operate on. If not specified, you may be
prompted to select a region.

To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
\f5\fIcompute/region\fR\fR property:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config set compute/region REGION
.RE

A list of regions can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute regions list
.RE

To unset the property, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config unset compute/region
.RE

Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
\f5\fICLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION\fR\fR.
