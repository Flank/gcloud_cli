.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR Update the value of a resource setting

This first converts the contents of the specified file into a setting object. It
then fetches the current setting using GetSetting. If it does not exist, the
setting is created using CreateSetting. If it does, the retrieved setting is
checked to see if it needs to be updated. If so, the setting is updated using
UpdateSetting.
