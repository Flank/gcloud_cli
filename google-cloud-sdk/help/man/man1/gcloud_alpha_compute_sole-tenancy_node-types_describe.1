.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR Describe a Compute Engine node type.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m

\fINAME\fR
Name of the node types to operate on.

.RS 2m

\fB\-\-zone\fR=\fIZONE\fR
Zone of the node types to operate on. If not specified and the
\f5\fIcompute/zone\fR\fR property isn't set, you may be prompted to select a
zone.

To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
\f5\fIcompute/zone\fR\fR property:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE
.RE

A list of zones can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute zones list
.RE

To unset the property, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config unset compute/zone
.RE

Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
\f5\fICLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE\fR\fR.
