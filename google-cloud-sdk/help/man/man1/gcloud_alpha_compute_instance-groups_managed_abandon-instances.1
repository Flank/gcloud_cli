.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR \fBgcloud alpha compute instance\-groups managed
abandon\-instances\fR abandons one or more instances from a managed instance
group, thereby reducing the targetSize of the group. Once instances have been
abandoned, the currentSize of the group is automatically reduced as well to
reflect the change.

Abandoning an instance does not reboot or delete the underlying virtual machine
instances, but just removes the instances from the instance group. If you would
like the delete the underlying instances, use the \f5delete\-instances\fR
command instead.

For a more detailed overview of how abandoning instances from a managed instance
group works, refer to this section:
