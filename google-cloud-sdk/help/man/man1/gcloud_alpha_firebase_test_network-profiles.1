.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR A network traffic profile consists of a set of parameters to
emulate network conditions when running a test. This feature only works on
physical devices. The network shaping parameters are:

.RS 2m
.IP "\(bu" 2m
\fBRULE\fR: Where to apply traffic shaping. The UP rule shapes the connection
from the device to the internet. The DOWN rule shapes the connection from the
internet to the device.
.IP "\(bu" 2m
\fBDELAY\fR: The delay in packet transmission, in ms.
.IP "\(bu" 2m
\fBLOSS_RATIO\fR: The ratio of packets dropped during transmission.
.IP "\(bu" 2m
\fBDUPLICATION_RATIO\fR: The ratio of packets duplicated during transmission.
.IP "\(bu" 2m
\fBBANDWIDTH\fR: The average packet transmission rate in kbits/s, as defined by
the token bucket algorithm.
.IP "\(bu" 2m
\fBBURST\fR: The total size, in kbits, by which packets can exceed the
bandwidth, as defined by the token bucket algorithm.

.SH "NOTES"

This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right project,
you may be trying to access an API with an invitation\-only early access
allowlist. These variants are also available:
