gcloud alpha compute instances remove\-tags \- remove tags from Google Compute Engine virtual machine instances



.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP
\f5gcloud alpha compute instances remove\-tags\fR \fIINSTANCE_NAME\fR (\fB\-\-all\fR\ |\ \fB\-\-tags\fR=\fITAG\fR,[\fITAG\fR,...]) [\fB\-\-zone\fR=\fIZONE\fR] [\fIGCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG\ ...\fR]



.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR \fBgcloud alpha compute instances remove\-tags\fR is used to
remove tags to Google Compute Engine virtual machine instances. For example:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha compute instances remove\-tags example\-instance \e
    \-\-tags tag\-1,tag\-2
.RE

will remove tags \f5\fItag\-1\fR\fR and \f5\fItag\-2\fR\fR from the existing
tags of 'example\-instance'.

Tags can be used to identify instances when adding network firewall rules. Tags
can also be used to get firewall rules that already exist to be applied to the
instance. See \fBgcloud compute firewall\-rules create\fR(1) for more details.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fIINSTANCE_NAME\fR
Name of the instance to set tags on.

.SH "REQUIRED FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m

Exactly one of these must be specified:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-all\fR
Remove all tags from the instance.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-tags\fR=\fITAG\fR,[\fITAG\fR,...]
Specifies strings to be removed from the instance tags. Multiple tags can be
removed by repeating this flag.

.SH "OPTIONAL FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-zone\fR=\fIZONE\fR
Zone of the instance to set tags on. If not specified, you may be prompted to
select a zone. \f5gcloud\fR will attempt to identify the zone by searching for
resources in your project. If the zone cannot be determined, you will then be
prompted with all Google Cloud Platform zones.

To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
\f5\fIcompute/zone\fR\fR property:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE
.RE

A list of zones can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute zones list
.RE

To unset the property, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config unset compute/zone
.RE

Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
\f5\fICLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE\fR\fR.
