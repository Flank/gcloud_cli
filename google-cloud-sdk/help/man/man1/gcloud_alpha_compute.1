.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR The gcloud compute command group lets you create, configure, and
manipulate Compute Engine virtual machine (VM) instances.

With Compute Engine, you can create and run VMs on Google's infrastructure.
Compute Engine offers scale, performance, and value that lets you launch large
compute clusters on Google's infrastructure.

For more information about Compute Engine, see the Compute Engine overview
(https://cloud.google.com/compute/) and the Compute Engine user documentation
(https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/).
