.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR The gcloud compute command group lets you create, configure and
manipulate Google Compute Engine virtual machines.

With Compute Engine you can create and run virtual machines on Google
infrastructure. Compute Engine offers scale, performance, and value that allows
you to easily launch large compute clusters on Google's infrastructure.

More information on Compute Engine can be found here:
https://cloud.google.com/compute/ and detailed documentation can be found here:
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/



.SH "GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS"

These flags are available to all commands: \-\-account, \-\-configuration,
\-\-flatten, \-\-format, \-\-help, \-\-log\-http, \-\-project, \-\-quiet,
\-\-trace\-token, \-\-user\-output\-enabled, \-\-verbosity. Run \fB$ gcloud
help\fR for details.
