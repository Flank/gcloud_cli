.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR \fB(DEPRECATED)\fR This command group is deprecated. Use \f5gcloud
alpha compute instance\-groups managed rolling\-action\fR command group instead.

Rolls back the update in state ROLLING_FORWARD, ROLLING_BACK or PAUSED (fails if
the update is in any other state). No\-op if invoked in state ROLLED_BACK.

Rollback sets the template that the Managed Instance Group used before the
update was started and gradually restarts back to the old template all instances
that are running in the new template.
