.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR \fBgcloud alpha compute target\-https\-proxies create\fR is used
to create target HTTPS proxies. A target HTTPS proxy is referenced by one or
more forwarding rules which define which packets the proxy is responsible for
routing. The target HTTPS proxy points to a URL map that defines the rules for
routing the requests. The URL map's job is to map URLs to backend services which
handle the actual requests. The target HTTPS proxy also points to at most 10 SSL
certificates used for server\-side authentication. The target HTTPS proxy can be
associated with at most one SSL policy.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fINAME\fR
The name of the target HTTPS proxy to create.

.SH "REQUIRED FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-ssl\-certificates\fR=\fISSL_CERTIFICATE\fR,[\fISSL_CERTIFICATE\fR,...]
References to at most 10 SSL certificate resources that are used for
server\-side authentication. The first SSL certificate in this list is
considered the primary SSL certificate associated with the load balancer. The
SSL certificate must exist and cannot be deleted while referenced by a target
HTTPS proxy.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-url\-map\fR=\fIURL_MAP\fR
A reference to a URL map resource that defines the mapping of URLs to backend
services. The URL map must exist and cannot be deleted while referenced by a
target HTTPS proxy.

.SH "OPTIONAL FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-description\fR=\fIDESCRIPTION\fR
An optional, textual description for the target HTTPS proxy.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-quic\-override\fR=\fIQUIC_OVERRIDE\fR; default="NONE"
Controls whether load balancer may negotiate QUIC with clients. QUIC is a new
transport which reduces latency compared to that of TCP. See
https://www.chromium.org/quic for more details. \fIQUIC_OVERRIDE\fR must be one
of:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fBDISABLE\fR
Disallows load balancer to negotiate QUIC with clients.
.TP 2m
\fBENABLE\fR
Allows load balancer to negotiate QUIC with clients.
.TP 2m
\fBNONE\fR
Allows Google to control when QUIC is rolled out.

.RE
.sp
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-ssl\-policy\fR=\fISSL_POLICY\fR
A reference to an SSL policy resource that defines the server\-side support for
SSL features and affects the connections between clients and the HTTPS proxy
load balancer. The SSL policy must exist and cannot be deleted while referenced
by a target HTTPS proxy.
