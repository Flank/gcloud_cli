.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP
\f5gcloud alpha ml\-engine local predict\fR \fB\-\-model\-dir\fR=\fIMODEL_DIR\fR (\fB\-\-json\-instances\fR=\fIJSON_INSTANCES\fR\ |\ \fB\-\-text\-instances\fR=\fITEXT_INSTANCES\fR) [\fIGCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG\ ...\fR]



.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR \fBgcloud alpha ml\-engine local predict\fR performs prediction
locally with the given instances. It requires the TensorFlow SDK be installed
locally. The output format mirrors \f5gcloud ml\-engine predict\fR (online
