.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR \fBgcloud alpha compute instances create\fR facilitates the
creation of Google Compute Engine virtual machines. For example, running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha compute instances create example\-instance\-1 \e
    example\-instance\-2 example\-instance\-3 \-\-zone us\-central1\-a
.RE

will create three instances called \f5example\-instance\-1\fR,
\f5example\-instance\-2\fR, and \f5example\-instance\-3\fR in the
\f5us\-central1\-a\fR zone.

When an instance is in RUNNING state and the system begins to boot, the instance
creation is considered finished, and the command returns with a list of new
virtual machines. Note that you usually cannot log into a new instance until it
finishes booting. Check the progress of an instance using \f5gcloud compute
instances get\-serial\-port\-output\fR.

For more examples, refer to the \fBEXAMPLES\fR section below.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fBtype\fR
The specific type (e.g. nvidia\-tesla\-k80 for nVidia Tesla K80) of accelerator
to attach to the instances. Use 'gcloud compute accelerator\-types list' to
learn about all available accelerator types.

\fBcount\fR
The number of pieces of the accelerator to attach to the instances. The default
value is 1.

.RE
.sp
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-async\fR
Display information about the operation in progress, without waiting for the
operation to complete.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-boot\-disk\-auto\-delete\fR
Automatically delete boot disks when their instances are deleted. Enabled by
default, use \fB\-\-no\-boot\-disk\-auto\-delete\fR to disable.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-boot\-disk\-device\-name\fR=\fIBOOT_DISK_DEVICE_NAME\fR
The name the guest operating system will see for the boot disk as. This option
can only be specified if a new boot disk is being created (as opposed to
mounting an existing persistent disk).

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-boot\-disk\-size\fR=\fIBOOT_DISK_SIZE\fR
The size of the boot disk. This option can only be specified if a new boot disk
is being created (as opposed to mounting an existing persistent disk). The value
must be a whole number followed by a size unit of \f5\fIKB\fR\fR for kilobyte,
\f5\fIMB\fR\fR for megabyte, \f5\fIGB\fR\fR for gigabyte, or \f5\fITB\fR\fR for
terabyte. For example, \f5\fI10GB\fR\fR will produce a 10 gigabyte disk. The
minimum size a boot disk can have is 10 GB. Disk size must be a multiple of 1
GB. Limit your boot disk size to 2TB to account for MBR partition table
limitations.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-boot\-disk\-type\fR=\fIBOOT_DISK_TYPE\fR
The type of the boot disk. This option can only be specified if a new boot disk
is being created (as opposed to mounting an existing persistent disk). To get a
list of available disk types, run \f5$ gcloud compute disk\-types list\fR.

image when a specific version of an image is needed. If both image and
image\-family flags are omitted a blank disk will be created.

.TP 2m
\fBimage\-family\fR
The family of the image that the disk will be initialized with. When a family is
specified instead of an image, the latest non\-deprecated image associated with
that family is used. It is best practice to use image\-family when the latest
version of an image is needed.

see. If omitted, a device name of the form \f5\fIpersistent\-disk\-N\fR\fR will
be used.

.TP 2m
\fBauto\-delete\fR
If \f5\fIyes\fR\fR, this persistent disk will be automatically deleted when the
instance is deleted. However, if the disk is later detached from the instance,
this option won't apply. The default value for this is \f5\fIno\fR\fR.

.TP 2m
\fBkms\-key\fR
Fully qualified Cloud KMS cryptokey name that will protect the disk. This can
either be the fully qualified path or the name. The fully qualified Cloud KMS
cryptokey name format is:
\f5\fIprojects/<kms\-project>/locations/<kms\-location>/keyRings/<kms\-keyring>/
cryptoKeys/<key\-name>\fR\fR. If the value is not fully qualified then
kms\-location, kms\-keyring, and optionally kms\-project are required. See
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer\-managed\-encryption for
more details.

.TP 2m
\fBkms\-project\fR
Project that contains the Cloud KMS cryptokey that will protect the disk. If the
project is not specified then the project where the disk is being created will
be used. If this flag is set then key\-location, kms\-keyring, and kms\-key are
required. See
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer\-managed\-encryption for
more details.

.TP 2m
\fBkms\-location\fR
Location of the Cloud KMS cryptokey to be used for protecting the disk. All
Cloud KMS cryptokeys are reside in a 'location'. To get a list of possible
locations run 'gcloud kms locations list'. If this flag is set then kms\-keyring
and kms\-key are required. See
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer\-managed\-encryption for
more details.

.TP 2m
\fBkms\-keyring\fR
The keyring which contains the Cloud KMS cryptokey that will protect the disk.
If this flag is set then kms\-location and kms\-key are required. See
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer\-managed\-encryption for
more details.

.TP 2m
\fBsource\-snapshot\fR
The source disk snapshot that will be used to create the disk. You can provide
this as a full URL to the snapshot or just the snapshot name. For example, the
following are valid values:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-csek\-key\-file\fR=\fIFILE\fR
Path to a Customer\-Supplied Encryption Key (CSEK) key file, mapping Google
Compute Engine resources to user managed keys to be used when creating,
mounting, or snapshotting disks.

If you pass \f5\-\fR as value of the flag the CSEK will be read from stdin. See
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer\-supplied\-encryption for
more details.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-deletion\-protection\fR
Enables deletion protection for the instance.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-description\fR=\fIDESCRIPTION\fR
Specifies a textual description of the instances.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-disk\fR=[\fIauto\-delete\fR=\fIAUTO\-DELETE\fR],[\fIboot\fR=\fIBOOT\fR],[\fIdevice\-name\fR=\fIDEVICE\-NAME\fR],[\fImode\fR=\fIMODE\fR],[\fIname\fR=\fINAME\fR],[\fIscope\fR=\fISCOPE\fR]
Attaches persistent disks to the instances. The disks specified must already
exist.

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fBname\fR
The disk to attach to the instances. When creating more than one instance and
using this property, the only valid mode for attaching the disk is read\-only
(see \fBmode\fR below).

.TP 2m
\fBmode\fR
Specifies the mode of the disk. Supported options are \f5\fIro\fR\fR for
read\-only and \f5\fIrw\fR\fR for read\-write. If omitted, \f5\fIrw\fR\fR is
used as a default. It is an error for mode to be \f5\fIrw\fR\fR when creating
more than one instance because read\-write disks can only be attached to a
single instance.

.TP 2m
\fBboot\fR
If \f5\fIyes\fR\fR, indicates that this is a boot disk. The virtual machines
will use the first partition of the disk for their root file systems. The
default value for this is \f5\fIno\fR\fR.

.TP 2m
\fBdevice\-name\fR
An optional name that indicates the disk name the guest operating system will
see. If omitted, a device name of the form \f5\fIpersistent\-disk\-N\fR\fR will
be used.

.TP 2m
\fBauto\-delete\fR
If \f5\fIyes\fR\fR, this persistent disk will be automatically deleted when the
instance is deleted. However, if the disk is later detached from the instance,
this option won't apply. The default value for this is \f5\fIno\fR\fR.

.TP 2m
\fBscope\fR
Can be \f5zonal\fR or \f5regional\fR. If \f5\fIzonal\fR\fR, the disk is
interpreted as a zonal disk in the same zone as the instance (default). If
\f5\fIregional\fR\fR, the disk is interpreted as a regional disk in the same
region as the instance. The default value for this is \f5\fIzonal\fR\fR.

see. If omitted, a device name of the form \f5\fIlocal\-ssd\-N\fR\fR will be
used.

.TP 2m
\fBinterface\fR
Optional. The kind of disk interface exposed to the VM for this SSD. Valid
values are \f5\fISCSI\fR\fR and \f5\fINVME\fR\fR. SCSI is the default and is
supported by more guest operating systems. NVME may provide higher performance.

.TP 2m
\fBsize\fR
Optional. Size of the SSD disk. The value must be a whole number followed by a
size unit of \f5\fIKB\fR\fR for kilobyte, \f5\fIMB\fR\fR for megabyte,
\f5\fIGB\fR\fR for gigabyte, or \f5\fITB\fR\fR for terabyte. For example,
\f5\fI750GB\fR\fR will produce a 750 gigabyte disk. The size must be a multiple
of 375 GB and the default is 375 GB. For Alpha API only.

.RE
.sp
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-machine\-type\fR=\fIMACHINE_TYPE\fR
Specifies the machine type used for the instances. To get a list of available
machine types, run 'gcloud compute machine\-types list'. If unspecified, the

In images that have Compute Engine tools installed on them, such as the official
images (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images), the following metadata
keys have special meanings:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fBstartup\-script\fR
Specifies a script that will be executed by the instances once they start
running. For convenience, \f5\fI\-\-metadata\-from\-file\fR\fR can be used to
pull the value from a file.

.TP 2m
\fBstartup\-script\-url\fR
Same as \f5\fIstartup\-script\fR\fR except that the script contents are pulled
from a publicly\-accessible location on the web.

.RE
.sp
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-metadata\-from\-file\fR=\fIKEY\fR=\fILOCAL_FILE_PATH\fR,[...]
Same as \f5\fI\-\-metadata\fR\fR except that the value for the entry will be
read from a local file. This is useful for values that are too large such as
\f5\fIstartup\-script\fR\fR contents.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-min\-cpu\-platform\fR=\fIPLATFORM\fR
When specified, the VM will be scheduled on host with specified CPU architecture
or a newer one. To list available CPU platforms in given zone, run:

https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/specify\-min\-cpu\-platform

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-network\fR=\fINETWORK\fR
Specifies the network that the instances will be part of. If \-\-subnet is also
specified subnet must be a subnetwork of network specified by \-\-network. If
neither is specified, this defaults to the "default" network.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-network\-interface\fR=[\fIPROPERTY\fR=\fIVALUE\fR,...]
Adds a network interface to the instance. Mutually exclusive with any of these
flags: \fB\-\-address\fR, \fB\-\-network\fR, \fB\-\-network\-tier\fR,

The following keys are allowed:
.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fBaddress\fR
Assigns the given external address to the instance that is created. Specifying
an empty string will assign an ephemeral IP. Mutually exclusive with
no\-address. If neither key is present the instance will get an ephemeral IP.

.TP 2m
\fBnetwork\fR
Specifies the network that the interface will be part of. If subnet is also
specified it must be subnetwork of this network. If neither is specified, this
defaults to the "default" network.

.TP 2m
\fBno\-address\fR
If specified the interface will have no external IP. Mutually exclusive with
address. If neither key is present the instance will get an ephemeral IP.

.TP 2m
\fBnetwork\-tier\fR
Specifies the network tier of the interface. \f5\fINETWORK_TIER\fR\fR must be
one of: \f5PREMIUM\fR, \f5STANDARD\fR. The default value is \f5PREMIUM\fR.

.TP 2m
\fBprivate\-network\-ip\fR
Assigns the given RFC1918 IP address to the interface.

.TP 2m
\fBsubnet\fR
Specifies the subnet that the interface will be part of. If network key is also
specified this must be a subnetwork of the specified network.

.TP 2m
\fBaliases\fR

multiple IP alias ranges, they are separated by semicolons.

For example:

.RS 2m
\-\-aliases="10.128.1.0/24;range1:/32"
.RE


Each IP alias range consists of a range name and an IP range separated by a
colon, or just the IP range. The range name is the name of the range within the
network interface's subnet from which to allocate an IP alias range. If
unspecified, it defaults to the primary IP range of the subnet. The IP range can
be a CIDR range (e.g. \f5192.168.100.0/24\fR), a single IP address (e.g.
\f5192.168.100.1\fR), or a netmask in CIDR format (e.g. \f5/24\fR). If the IP
range is specified by CIDR range or single IP address, it must belong to the
CIDR range specified by the range name on the subnet. If the IP range is
specified by netmask, the IP allocator will pick an available range with the
specified netmask and allocate it to this network interface.

.RE
.sp
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-network\-tier\fR=\fINETWORK_TIER\fR
Specifies the network tier that will be used to configure the instance.
\f5\fINETWORK_TIER\fR\fR must be one of: \f5PREMIUM\fR, \f5STANDARD\fR. The
default value is \f5PREMIUM\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-preemptible\fR

preempted to free up resources for standard VM instances, and will only be able
to run for a limited amount of time. Preemptible instances can not be restarted
and will not migrate.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-private\-network\-ip\fR=\fIPRIVATE_NETWORK_IP\fR
Specifies the RFC1918 IP to assign to the instance. The IP should be in the
subnet or legacy network IP range.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-require\-csek\-key\-create\fR
Refuse to create resources not protected by a user managed key in the key file
when \-\-csek\-key\-file is given. This behavior is enabled by default to
prevent incorrect gcloud invocations from accidentally creating resources with
no user managed key. Disabling the check allows creation of some resources
without a matching Customer\-Supplied Encryption Key in the supplied
\-\-csek\-key\-file. See
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer\-supplied\-encryption for
more details. Enabled by default, use \fB\-\-no\-require\-csek\-key\-create\fR
to disable.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-resource\-policies\fR=[\fIRESOURCE_POLICY\fR,...]
A list of resource policy names to be added to the instance. The policies must
exist in the same region as the instance.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-restart\-on\-failure\fR
The instances will be restarted if they are terminated by Compute Engine. This
does not affect terminations performed by the user. Enabled by default, use
\fB\-\-no\-restart\-on\-failure\fR to disable.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-shielded\-vm\-integrity\-monitoring\fR
Enables monitoring and attestation of the boot integrity of the instance. The
attestation is performed against the integrity policy baseline. This baseline is
initially derived from the implicitly trusted boot image when the instance is
created. This baseline can be updated by using
\f5\-\-shielded\-vm\-learn\-integrity\-policy\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-shielded\-vm\-secure\-boot\fR
The instance will boot with secure boot enabled.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-shielded\-vm\-vtpm\fR
The instance will boot with the TPM (Trusted Platform Module) enabled. A TPM is

remote attestation, encryption and sealing of keys.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-source\-instance\-template\fR=\fISOURCE_INSTANCE_TEMPLATE\fR
The name of the instance template that the instance will be created from.

Users can also override machine type and labels. Values of other flags will be
ignored and \f5\-\-source\-instance\-template\fR will be used instead.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-subnet\fR=\fISUBNET\fR
Specifies the subnet that the instances will be part of. If \-\-network is also
specified subnet must be a subnetwork of network specified by \-\-network.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-tags\fR=\fITAG\fR,[\fITAG\fR,...]
Specifies a list of tags to apply to the instances for identifying the instances
to which network firewall rules will apply. See \fBgcloud compute
firewall\-rules create\fR(1) for more details.

To list instances with their respective status and tags, run:

$ gcloud compute instances list \e
    \-\-format='table(name,status,tags.list())'
.RE

To list instances tagged with a specific tag, \f5tag1\fR, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute instances list \-\-filter='tags:tag1'
.RE

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-zone\fR=\fIZONE\fR
Zone of the instances to create. If not specified and the
\f5\fIcompute/zone\fR\fR property isn't set, you may be prompted to select a
zone.

To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
\f5\fIcompute/zone\fR\fR property:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE
.RE

A list of zones can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute zones list
.RE

To unset the property, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config unset compute/zone
.RE

\fB\-\-image\fR=\fIIMAGE\fR
Specifies the boot image for the instances. For each instance, a new boot disk
will be created from the given image. Each boot disk will have the same name as
the instance. To view a list of public images and projects, run \f5$ gcloud
compute images list\fR. It is best practice to use \f5\-\-image\fR when a
specific version of an image is needed.

When using this option, \f5\fI\-\-boot\-disk\-device\-name\fR\fR and

name and size, respectively.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-image\-family\fR=\fIIMAGE_FAMILY\fR
The family of the image that the boot disk will be initialized with. When a
family is specified instead of an image, the latest non\-deprecated image
associated with that family is used. It is best practice to use
\f5\-\-image\-family\fR when the latest version of an image is needed.
