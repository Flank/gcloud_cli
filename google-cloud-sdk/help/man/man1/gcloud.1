.SH "DESCRIPTION"

The \fBgcloud\fR CLI manages authentication, local configuration, developer
workflow, and interactions with the Google Cloud Platform APIs.

For a quick introduction to the gcloud command\-line tool, a list of commonly
used commands, and a look at how these commands are structured, run \f5gcloud
cheat\-sheet\fR or refer to the gcloud command\-line tool cheat sheet:
https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/cheatsheet



.SH "GLOBAL FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-account\fR=\fIACCOUNT\fR
Google Cloud Platform user account to use for invocation. Overrides the default
\fBcore/account\fR property value for this command invocation.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-billing\-project\fR=\fIBILLING_PROJECT\fR
The Google Cloud Platform project that will be charged quota for operations
performed in gcloud. If you need to operate on one project, but need quota
against a different project, you can use this flag to specify the billing
project. If both \f5billing/quota_project\fR and \f5\-\-billing\-project\fR are
specified, \f5\-\-billing\-project\fR takes precedence. Run \f5$ gcloud config
set \-\-help\fR to see more information about \f5billing/quota_project\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-configuration\fR=\fICONFIGURATION\fR
The configuration to use for this command invocation. For more information on
how to use configurations, run: \f5gcloud topic configurations\fR. You can also
use the CLOUDSDK_ACTIVE_CONFIG_NAME environment variable to set the equivalent
of this flag for a terminal session.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-flags\-file\fR=\fIYAML_FILE\fR
A YAML or JSON file that specifies a \fB\-\-flag\fR:\fBvalue\fR dictionary.
Useful for specifying complex flag values with special characters that work with
any command interpreter. Additionally, each \fB\-\-flags\-file\fR arg is
replaced by its constituent flags. See $ gcloud topic flags\-file for more
information.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-flatten\fR=[\fIKEY\fR,...]
Flatten \fIname\fR[] output resource slices in \fIKEY\fR into separate records
for each item in each slice. Multiple keys and slices may be specified. This
also flattens keys for \fB\-\-format\fR and \fB\-\-filter\fR. For example,
\fB\-\-flatten=abc.def\fR flattens \fBabc.def[].ghi\fR references to
\fBabc.def.ghi\fR. A resource record containing \fBabc.def[]\fR with N elements
will expand to N records in the flattened output. This flag interacts with other
flags that are applied in this order: \fB\-\-flatten\fR, \fB\-\-sort\-by\fR,
\fB\-\-filter\fR, \fB\-\-limit\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-format\fR=\fIFORMAT\fR
Set the format for printing command output resources. The default is a
command\-specific human\-friendly output format. The supported formats are:
\f5config\fR, \f5csv\fR, \f5default\fR, \f5diff\fR, \f5disable\fR,
\f5flattened\fR, \f5get\fR, \f5json\fR, \f5list\fR, \f5multi\fR, \f5none\fR,
\f5object\fR, \f5table\fR, \f5text\fR, \f5value\fR, \f5yaml\fR. For more details
run $ gcloud topic formats.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-help\fR
Display detailed help.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-project\fR=\fIPROJECT_ID\fR
The Google Cloud Platform project ID to use for this invocation. If omitted,
then the current project is assumed; the current project can be listed using
\f5gcloud config list \-\-format='text(core.project)'\fR and can be set using
\f5gcloud config set project PROJECTID\fR.

\f5\-\-project\fR and its fallback \f5core/project\fR property play two roles in
the invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate on. It also
specifies the project for API enablement check, quota, and billing. To specify a
different project for quota and billing, use \f5\-\-billing\-project\fR or
\f5billing/quota_project\fR property.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-quiet\fR, \fB\-q\fR
Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input is
required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised. Overrides the
default core/disable_prompts property value for this command invocation. This is
equivalent to setting the environment variable
\f5CLOUDSDK_CORE_DISABLE_PROMPTS\fR to 1.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-verbosity\fR=\fIVERBOSITY\fR; default="warning"
Override the default verbosity for this command. Overrides the default
\fBcore/verbosity\fR property value for this command invocation. \fIVERBOSITY\fR
must be one of: \fBdebug\fR, \fBinfo\fR, \fBwarning\fR, \fBerror\fR,
\fBcritical\fR, \fBnone\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-version\fR, \fB\-v\fR
Print version information and exit. This flag is only available at the global
level.

.TP 2m
\fB\-h\fR
Print a summary help and exit.

.SH "OTHER FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-impersonate\-service\-account\fR=\fISERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL\fR
For this gcloud invocation, all API requests will be made as the given service
account instead of the currently selected account. This is done without needing
to create, download, and activate a key for the account. In order to perform
operations as the service account, your currently selected account must have an
IAM role that includes the iam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken permission for the
service account. The roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator role has this
permission or you may create a custom role. Overrides the default
\fBauth/impersonate_service_account\fR property value for this command
invocation.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-log\-http\fR
Log all HTTP server requests and responses to stderr. Overrides the default
\fBcore/log_http\fR property value for this command invocation.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-trace\-token\fR=\fITRACE_TOKEN\fR
Token used to route traces of service requests for investigation of issues.
Overrides the default \fBcore/trace_token\fR property value for this command
invocation.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-user\-output\-enabled\fR
Print user intended output to the console. Overrides the default
\fBcore/user_output_enabled\fR property value for this command invocation. Use
\fB\-\-no\-user\-output\-enabled\fR to disable.
