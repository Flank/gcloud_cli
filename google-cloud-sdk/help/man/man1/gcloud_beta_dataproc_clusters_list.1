\f5gcloud beta dataproc clusters list\fR [\fB\-\-region\fR=\fIREGION\fR] [\fB\-\-filter\fR=\fIEXPRESSION\fR] [\fB\-\-limit\fR=\fILIMIT\fR] [\fB\-\-page\-size\fR=\fIPAGE_SIZE\fR;\ default=100] [\fB\-\-sort\-by\fR=[\fIFIELD\fR,...]] [\fIGCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG\ ...\fR]



.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(BETA)\fR View a list of clusters in a project. An optional filter can be
used to constrain the clusters returned. Filters are case\-sensitive and have
the following syntax:

.RS 2m
field = value [AND [field = value]] ...
.RE

where \f5field\fR is one of \f5status.state\fR, \f5clusterName\fR, or
\f5labels.[KEY]\fR, and \f5[KEY]\fR is a label key. \f5value\fR can be \f5*\fR
to match all values. \f5status.state\fR can be one of the following:
\f5ACTIVE\fR, \f5INACTIVE\fR, \f5CREATING\fR, \f5RUNNING\fR, \f5ERROR\fR,
\f5DELETING\fR, or \f5UPDATING\fR. \f5ACTIVE\fR contains the \f5CREATING\fR,
\f5UPDATING\fR, and \f5RUNNING\fR states. \f5INACTIVE\fR contains the
\f5DELETING\fR and \f5ERROR\fR states. \f5clusterName\fR is the name of the
cluster provided at creation time. Only the logical \f5AND\fR operator is
supported; space\-separated items are treated as having an implicit \f5AND\fR
operator.



.SH "FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-region\fR=\fIREGION\fR
Cloud Dataproc region to use. Each Cloud Dataproc region constitutes an
independent resource namespace constrained to deploying instances into Compute
Engine zones inside the region. The default value of \f5global\fR is a special
multi\-region namespace which is capable of deploying instances into all Compute
Engine zones globally, and is disjoint from other Cloud Dataproc regions.
Overrides the default \fBdataproc/region\fR property value for this command
invocation.

.SH "LIST COMMAND FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-filter\fR=\fIEXPRESSION\fR
Apply a Boolean filter \fIEXPRESSION\fR to each resource item to be listed. If
the expression evaluates True then that item is listed. For more details and
examples of filter expressions run $ gcloud topic filters. This flag interacts
with other flags that are applied in this order: \fB\-\-flatten\fR,
\fB\-\-sort\-by\fR, \fB\-\-filter\fR, \fB\-\-limit\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-limit\fR=\fILIMIT\fR
The maximum number of resources to list. The default is \fBunlimited\fR. This
flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
\fB\-\-flatten\fR, \fB\-\-sort\-by\fR, \fB\-\-filter\fR, \fB\-\-limit\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-page\-size\fR=\fIPAGE_SIZE\fR; default=100
Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag specifies the
maximum number of resources per page. The default is \fB100\fR. Paging may be
applied before or after \fB\-\-filter\fR and \fB\-\-limit\fR depending on the
service.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-sort\-by\fR=[\fIFIELD\fR,...]
A comma\-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The default
order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending order on that
field. This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
\fB\-\-flatten\fR, \fB\-\-sort\-by\fR, \fB\-\-filter\fR, \fB\-\-limit\fR.

.SH "EXAMPLES"

To see the list of all clusters, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud beta dataproc clusters list
.RE

To show a cluster whose name is \f5mycluster\fR, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud beta dataproc clusters list \e
    \-\-filter='clusterName = mycluster'
.RE

To see the list of all clusters with particular labels, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud beta dataproc clusters list \e
    \-\-filter='labels.env = staging AND labels.starred = *'
.RE

To see a list of all active clusters with particular labels, run:
