.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR The gcloud app command group lets you deploy and manage your
Google App Engine apps. These commands replace their equivalents in the appcfg
tool.

App Engine is a platform for building scalable web applications and mobile
backends. App Engine provides you with built\-in services and APIs such as NoSQL
datastores, memcache, and a user authentication API, common to most
applications.

More information on App Engine can be found here:
https://cloud.google.com/appengine and detailed documentation can be found here:
https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/
