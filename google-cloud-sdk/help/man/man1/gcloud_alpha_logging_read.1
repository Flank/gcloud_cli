.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR gcloud alpha logging read reads log entries. Log entries matching
\fBlog\-filter\fR are returned in order of decreasing timestamps, most\-recent
entries first. If the log entries come from multiple logs, then entries from
different logs might be intermingled in the results.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
[\fILOG_FILTER\fR]
Filter expression that specifies the log entries to return. A detailed guide on
basic and advanced filters can be found at:
https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/overview


.RE
.sp

.SH "FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-freshness\fR=\fIFRESHNESS\fR; default="1d"
Return entries that are not older than this value. Works only with DESC ordering
and filters without a timestamp. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on
duration formats.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-order\fR=\fIORDER\fR; default="desc"
Ordering of returned log entries based on timestamp field. \fIORDER\fR must be
one of: \fBdesc\fR, \fBasc\fR.

.TP 2m

At most one of these may be specified:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-billing\-account\fR=\fIBILLING_ACCOUNT_ID\fR
Read log entries associated with this billing account.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-folder\fR=\fIFOLDER_ID\fR
Read log entries associated with this folder.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-organization\fR=\fIORGANIZATION_ID\fR
Read log entries associated with this organization.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-project\fR=\fIPROJECT_ID\fR
Read log entries associated with this project.

The Google Cloud Platform project ID to use for this invocation. If omitted,
then the current project is assumed; the current project can be listed using
\f5gcloud config list \-\-format='text(core.project)'\fR and can be set using
\f5gcloud config set project PROJECTID\fR.

\f5\-\-project\fR and its fallback \f5core/project\fR property play two roles in
the invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate on. It also
specifies the project for API enablement check, quota, and billing. To specify a
different project for quota and billing, use \f5\-\-billing\-project\fR or
\f5billing/quota_project\fR property.

These arguments are used in conjunction with the parent to construct a view
resource.

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-bucket\fR=\fIBUCKET\fR
Id of the bucket. If this argument is provided then \f5\-\-location\fR and
\f5\-\-view\fR must also be specified. This flag must be specified if any of the
other arguments in this group are specified.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-location\fR=\fILOCATION\fR
Location of the bucket. If this argument is provided then \f5\-\-bucket\fR and
\f5\-\-view\fR must also be specified. This flag must be specified if any of the
other arguments in this group are specified.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-view\fR=\fIVIEW\fR
Id of the view. If this argument is provided then \f5\-\-location\fR and
\f5\-\-bucket\fR must also be specified. This flag must be specified if any of
the other arguments in this group are specified.

\fB\-\-limit\fR=\fILIMIT\fR

interacts with other flags that are applied in this order: \fB\-\-flatten\fR,
\fB\-\-sort\-by\fR, \fB\-\-filter\fR, \fB\-\-limit\fR.
