gcloud endpoints services deploy \- deploys a service configuration for the given service name



.SH "SYNOPSIS"

\f5gcloud endpoints services deploy\fR \fISERVICE_CONFIG_FILE\fR [\fISERVICE_CONFIG_FILE\fR\ ...] [\fB\-\-async\fR] [\fB\-\-force\fR,\ \fB\-f\fR] [\fB\-\-validate\-only\fR] [\fIGCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG\ ...\fR]



.SH "DESCRIPTION"

This command is used to deploy a service configuration for a service to Google
Service Management. As input, it takes one or more paths to service
configurations that should be uploaded. These configuration files can be Proto
Descriptors, Open API (Swagger) specifications, or Google Service Configuration
files in JSON or YAML formats.

If a service name is present in multiple configuration files (given in the
\f5host\fR field in OpenAPI specifications or the \f5name\fR field in Google
Service Configuration files), the first one will take precedence.

This command will block until deployment is complete unless the \f5\-\-async\fR
flag is passed.
