.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(BETA)\fR \fBgcloud beta compute forwarding\-rules create\fR is used to
create a forwarding rule. A forwarding rule directs traffic that matches a
destination IP address (and possibly a TCP or UDP port) to a forwarding target
(load balancer, VPN gateway or VM instance).

Forwarding rules can be either global or regional, specified with the
\f5\fI\-\-global\fR\fR or \f5\fI\-\-region=REGION\fR\fR flags. For more
information about the scope of a forwarding rule, refer to
https://cloud.google.com/load\-balancing/docs/forwarding\-rule\-concepts.

Forwarding rules can be external, internal, internal managed, or internal
self\-managed, specified with the
\f5\fI\-\-load\-balancing\-scheme=[EXTERNAL|INTERNAL|INTERNAL_MANAGED|INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED]\fR\fR
flag. External forwarding rules are accessible from the internet, while internal
forwarding rules are only accessible from within their VPC networks. You can
specify a reserved static external or internal IP address with the
\f5\fI\-\-address=ADDRESS\fR\fR flag for the forwarding rule. Otherwise, if the
flag is unspecified, an ephemeral IP address is automatically assigned (global
IP addresses for global forwarding rules and regional IP addresses for regional
forwarding rules); an internal forwarding rule is automatically assigned an
ephemeral internal IP address from the subnet specified with the
\f5\fI\-\-subnet\fR\fR flag. You must provide an IP address for an internal
self\-managed forwarding rule.

Different types of load balancers work at different layers of the OSI networking
model (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_layer). Layer 3/4 targets include
target pools, target SSL proxies, target TCP proxies, and backend services.
Layer 7 targets include target HTTP proxies and target HTTPS proxies. For more
information, refer to
https://cloud.google.com/load\-balancing/docs/forwarding\-rule\-concepts.


When creating a forwarding rule, exactly one of
\f5\fI\-\-target\-instance\fR\fR, \f5\fI\-\-target\-pool\fR\fR,
\f5\fI\-\-target\-http\-proxy\fR\fR, \f5\fI\-\-target\-https\-proxy\fR\fR,
\f5\fI\-\-target\-grpc\-proxy\fR\fR, \f5\fI\-\-target\-ssl\-proxy\fR\fR,
\f5\fI\-\-target\-tcp\-proxy\fR\fR, \f5\fI\-\-target\-vpn\-gateway\fR\fR or
\f5\fI\-\-backend\-service\fR\fR must be specified.

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute zones list
.RE

To unset the property, run:
