.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR Update a Cloud Scheduler job with a Pub/Sub target.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m

Job resource \- Job to update. This represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some
attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.
To set the [project] attribute: provide the argument [job] on the command line
with a fully specified name; provide the argument [\-\-project] on the command
line; set the property [core/project]. To set the [location] attribute: provide
the argument [job] on the command line with a fully specified name; as the
location of the current project's App Engine App. This must be specified.

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fIJOB\fR

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-description\fR=\fIDESCRIPTION\fR
Human\-readable description of the job.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-schedule\fR=\fISCHEDULE\fR
Schedule on which the job will be executed.

As a general rule, execution \f5n + 1\fR of a job will not begin until execution
\f5n\fR has finished. Cloud Scheduler will never allow two simultaneously
outstanding executions. For example, this implies that if the \f5n+1\fR
execution is scheduled to run at \f516:00\fR but the \f5n\fR execution takes
until \f516:15\fR, the \f5n+1\fR execution will not start until \f516:15\fR. A
scheduled start time will be delayed if the previous execution has not ended
when its scheduled time occurs.

If \-\-retry\-count > 0 and a job attempt fails, the job will be tried a total
of \-\-retry\-count times, with exponential backoff, until the next scheduled
start time.

The schedule can be either of the following types:
