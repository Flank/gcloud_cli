.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fBgcloud compute target\-ssl\-proxies create\fR is used to create target SSL
proxies. A target SSL proxy is referenced by one or more forwarding rules which
define which packets the proxy is responsible for routing. The target SSL proxy
points to a backend service which handle the actual requests. The target SSL
proxy also points to at most 10 SSL certificates used for server\-side
authentication.
