.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(BETA)\fR This command signs and creates a Binary Authorization attestation
for your project. The attestation is created for the specified artifact (e.g. a
gcr.io container URL), associate with the specified attestor, and stored under
the specified project.



.SH "REQUIRED FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-artifact\-url\fR=\fIARTIFACT_URL\fR
Container URL. May be in the \f5gcr.io/repository/image\fR format, or may
optionally contain the \f5http\fR or \f5https\fR scheme

.TP 2m

Attestor resource \- The Attestor whose Container Analysis Note will be used to
host the created attestation. In order to successfully attach the attestation,
the active gcloud account (core/account) must be able to read this attestor and
must have the \f5containeranalysis.notes.attachOccurrence\fR permission for the
Attestor's underlying Note resource (usually via the
\f5containeranalysis.notes.attacher\fR role). The arguments in this group can be
used to specify the attributes of this resource. This must be specified.


.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-attestor\fR=\fIATTESTOR\fR
ID of the attestor or fully qualified identifier for the attestor. This flag
must be specified if any of the other arguments in this group are specified.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-attestor\-project\fR=\fIATTESTOR_PROJECT\fR
Project ID of the Google Cloud Platform project for the attestor.

.TP 2m

CryptoKeyVersion resource \- The Cloud KMS (Key Management Service)
CryptoKeyVersion to use to sign the attestation payload. The arguments in this
group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. This must be
specified.


.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-keyversion\fR=\fIKEYVERSION\fR
ID of the CryptoKeyVersion or fully qualified identifier for the
CryptoKeyVersion. This flag must be specified if any of the other arguments in
this group are specified.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-keyversion\-key\fR=\fIKEYVERSION_KEY\fR
The key of the CryptoKeyVersion.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-keyversion\-keyring\fR=\fIKEYVERSION_KEYRING\fR
The keyring of the CryptoKeyVersion.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-keyversion\-location\fR=\fIKEYVERSION_LOCATION\fR
The location of the CryptoKeyVersion.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-keyversion\-project\fR=\fIKEYVERSION_PROJECT\fR
Project ID of the Google Cloud Platform project for the CryptoKeyVersion.

.SH "OPTIONAL FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-public\-key\-id\-override\fR=\fIPUBLIC_KEY_ID_OVERRIDE\fR
If provided, the ID of the public key that will be used to verify the
Attestation instead of the default generated one. This ID should match the one
found on the Attestor resource(s) which will use this Attestation.

This parameter is only necessary if the \f5\-\-public\-key\-id\-override\fR flag
was provided when this KMS key was added to the Attestor.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-validate\fR
Whether to validate that the Attestation can be verified by the provided
Attestor.
