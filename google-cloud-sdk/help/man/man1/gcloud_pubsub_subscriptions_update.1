receiving a message before re\-attempting delivery.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-expiration\-period\fR=\fIEXPIRATION_PERIOD\fR
The subscription will expire if it is inactive for the given period. Valid
values are strings of the form INTEGER[UNIT], where UNIT is one of "s", "m",

"never" to indicate that the subscription will never expire.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-message\-retention\-duration\fR=\fIMESSAGE_RETENTION_DURATION\fR
How long to retain unacknowledged messages in the subscription's backlog, from
the moment a message is published. If \-\-retain\-acked\-messages is true, this

the default value. Valid values are strings of the form INTEGER[UNIT], where
UNIT is one of "s", "m", "h", and "d" for seconds, minutes, hours, and days,
respectively. If the unit is omitted, seconds is assumed.

A URL to use as the endpoint for this subscription. This will also automatically
set the subscription type to PUSH.
