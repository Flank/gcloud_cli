.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fIPOLICY_ID\fR
Name of the guest policy to update.

.SH "REQUIRED FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-file\fR=\fIFILE\fR
The JSON or YAML file with the updated guest policy.

If this file specifies an etag value, the update succeeds only if the policy
that is already in place has a matching etag value. If no etag value is
specified, the specifications in the updated policy file replaces the existing
policy.

.SH "OPTIONAL FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m

The scope of the guest policy. If a scope is not specified, the current project
is used as the default. At most one of these may be specified:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-folder\fR=\fIFOLDER_ID\fR
The folder of the guest policy to update.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-organization\fR=\fIORGANIZATION_ID\fR
The organization of the guest policy to update.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-project\fR=\fIPROJECT_ID\fR
The project name to use. If a project name is not specified, then the current
project is used. The current project can be listed using gcloud config list
\-\-format='text(core.project)' and can be set using gcloud config set project
PROJECTID.

\f5\-\-project\fR and its fallback \f5core/project\fR property play two roles.
It specifies the project of the resource to operate on, and also specifies the
project for API enablement check, quota, and billing. To specify a different
project for quota and billing, use \f5\-\-billing\-project\fR or
\f5billing/quota_project\fR property.

command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right project,
