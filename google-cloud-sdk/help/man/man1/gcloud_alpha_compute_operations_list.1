.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR \fBgcloud alpha compute operations list\fR displays all Google
Compute Engine operations in a project.

By default, all global, regional, zonal and Compute Accounts operations are
listed. The results can be narrowed by providing combinations of the \-\-zones,
\-\-regions, \-\-global and \-\-accounts flags.

Note: \fBgcloud alpha compute operations list\fR displays operations fewer than
14 days old, up to a maximum of 5000.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
[\fINAME\fR ...]
(DEPRECATED) If provided, show details for the specified names and/or URIs of
resources.

Argument NAME is deprecated. Use \-\-filter="name=( 'NAME' ... )" instead.


.RE
.sp

.SH "FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-accounts\fR
If provided, all accounts resources are shown.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-global\fR
If provided, all global resources are shown.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-regexp\fR=\fIREGEXP\fR, \fB\-r\fR \fIREGEXP\fR
(DEPRECATED) A regular expression to filter the names of the results on. Any
names that do not match the entire regular expression will be filtered out.

Flag \-\-regexp is deprecated. Use \-\-filter="name~'REGEXP'" instead.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-regions\fR=[\fIREGION\fR,...]
If arguments are provided, only resources from the given regions are shown. If
no arguments are provided all regional operations are shown.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-zones\fR=[\fIZONE\fR,...]
If arguments are provided, only resources from the given zones are shown. If no
arguments are provided all zonal operations are shown.

.SH "LIST COMMAND FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-filter\fR=\fIEXPRESSION\fR
Apply a Boolean filter \fIEXPRESSION\fR to each resource item to be listed. If
the expression evaluates True then that item is listed. For more details and
examples of filter expressions run $ gcloud topic filters. This flag interacts
with other flags that are applied in this order: \fB\-\-flatten\fR,
\fB\-\-sort\-by\fR, \fB\-\-filter\fR, \fB\-\-limit\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-limit\fR=\fILIMIT\fR
The maximum number of resources to list. The default is \fBunlimited\fR. This
flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
\fB\-\-flatten\fR, \fB\-\-sort\-by\fR, \fB\-\-filter\fR, \fB\-\-limit\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-page\-size\fR=\fIPAGE_SIZE\fR
Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag specifies the
maximum number of resources per page. The default is determined by the service
if it supports paging, otherwise it is \fBunlimited\fR (no paging). Paging may
be applied before or after \fB\-\-filter\fR and \fB\-\-limit\fR depending on the
service.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-sort\-by\fR=[\fIFIELD\fR,...]
A comma\-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The default
order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending order on that
field. This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
\fB\-\-flatten\fR, \fB\-\-sort\-by\fR, \fB\-\-filter\fR, \fB\-\-limit\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-uri\fR
Print a list of resource URIs instead of the default output.
