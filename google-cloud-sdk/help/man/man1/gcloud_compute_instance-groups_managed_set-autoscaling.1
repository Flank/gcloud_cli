.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fBgcloud compute instance\-groups managed set\-autoscaling\fR sets autoscaling
parameters of specified managed instance group.

Autoscalers can use one or more policies listed below. Information on using
multiple policies can be found here:
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/autoscaler/multiple\-policies



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fINAME\fR
Name of the managed instance group to operate on.


.RE
.sp

.SH "REQUIRED FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-max\-num\-replicas\fR=\fIMAX_NUM_REPLICAS\fR
Maximum number of replicas Autoscaler will set.


.RE
.sp

.SH "OPTIONAL FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-cool\-down\-period\fR=\fICOOL_DOWN_PERIOD\fR
The time period that the autoscaler should wait before it starts collecting
information from a new instance. This prevents the autoscaler from collecting
information when the instance is initializing, during which the collected usage
would not be reliable. The default is 60s. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for
information on duration formats.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-custom\-metric\-utilization\fR=[\fImetric\fR=\fIMETRIC\fR],[\fIutilization\-target\fR=\fIUTILIZATION\-TARGET\fR],[\fIutilization\-target\-type\fR=\fIUTILIZATION\-TARGET\-TYPE\fR]
Adds a target metric value for the Autoscaler to use.

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fBmetric\fR
Protocol\-free URL of a Google Cloud Monitoring metric.

.TP 2m
\fButilization\-target\fR
Value of the metric Autoscaler will aim to maintain (greater than 0.0).

.TP 2m
\fButilization\-target\-type\fR
How target is expressed. Valid values: DELTA_PER_MINUTE, DELTA_PER_SECOND,
GAUGE.
.RE
.sp
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-description\fR=\fIDESCRIPTION\fR
Notes about Autoscaler.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-min\-num\-replicas\fR=\fIMIN_NUM_REPLICAS\fR
Minimum number of replicas Autoscaler will set.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-mode\fR=\fIMODE\fR
Set the mode of an autoscaler for a managed instance group.

You can turn off or restrict MIG autoscaler activities without affecting your
autoscaler configuration. The autoscaler configuration persists while the
activities are turned off or restricted, and the activities resume when the
autoscaler is turned on again or when the restrictions are lifted.

\fIMODE\fR must be one of:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fBoff\fR
Turns off autoscaling, while keeping the new configuration.
.TP 2m
\fBon\fR
Permits autoscaling to scale out and in (default for new autoscalers).
.TP 2m
\fBonly\-scale\-out\fR
Permits autoscaling to scale only out and not in.
.TP 2m
\fBonly\-up\fR
(DEPRECATED) Permits autoscaling to scale only out and not in.

.RS 2m
Value `only\-up` is deprecated. Use `\-\-mode only\-scale\-out`
instead.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-scale\-based\-on\-cpu\fR
Autoscaler will be based on CPU utilization.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-scale\-based\-on\-load\-balancing\fR
Use autoscaling based on load balancing utilization.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-scale\-in\-control\fR=[\fImax\-scaled\-in\-replicas\fR=\fIMAX\-SCALED\-IN\-REPLICAS\fR],[\fImax\-scaled\-in\-replicas\-percent\fR=\fIMAX\-SCALED\-IN\-REPLICAS\-PERCENT\fR],[\fItime\-window\fR=\fITIME\-WINDOW\fR]
Configuration that allows slower scale in so that even if Autoscaler recommends
an abrupt scale in of a managed instance group, it will be throttled as
specified by the parameters.

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fBmax\-scaled\-in\-replicas\fR
Maximum allowed number of VMs that can be deducted from the peak recommendation
during the window. Possibly all these VMs can be deleted at once so the
application needs to be prepared to lose that many VMs in one step. Mutually
exclusive with 'max\-scaled\-in\-replicas\-percent'.

.TP 2m
\fBmax\-scaled\-in\-replicas\-percent\fR
Maximum allowed percent of VMs that can be deducted from the peak recommendation
during the window. Possibly all these VMs can be deleted at once so the
application needs to be prepared to lose that many VMs in one step. Mutually
exclusive with 'max\-scaled\-in\-replicas'.

.TP 2m
\fBtime\-window\fR
How long back autoscaling should look when computing recommendations. The
autoscaler will not resize below the maximum allowed deduction subtracted from
the peak size observed in this period. Measured in seconds.

.RE
.sp
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-target\-cpu\-utilization\fR=\fITARGET_CPU_UTILIZATION\fR
Autoscaler will aim to maintain CPU utilization at target level (0.0 to 1.0).

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-target\-load\-balancing\-utilization\fR=\fITARGET_LOAD_BALANCING_UTILIZATION\fR
Autoscaler will aim to maintain the load balancing utilization level (greater
than 0.0).

.TP 2m

At most one of these may be specified:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-region\fR=\fIREGION\fR
Region of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified, you may be
prompted to select a region.

A list of regions can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute regions list
.RE

Overrides the default \fBcompute/region\fR property value for this command
invocation.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-zone\fR=\fIZONE\fR
Zone of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified, you may be
prompted to select a zone.

A list of zones can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute zones list
.RE

Overrides the default \fBcompute/zone\fR property value for this command
invocation.
