.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR Creates a new notification channel. A channel can be specified as
JSON/YAML passed in as a string through the \f5\-\-channel\-content\fR flag or
as a file through the \f5\-\-channel\-content\-from\-file\fR flag. A basic
channel can also be specified through command line flags. If a channel is
specified through \f5\-\-channel\-content\fR or
\f5\-\-channel\-content\-from\-file\fR, and additional flags are supplied, the
flags will override the given channel's settings.
