.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR Creates a new notification channel. A channel can be specified as
JSON/YAML passed in as a string through the \f5\-\-channel\-content\fR flag or
as a file through the \f5\-\-channel\-content\-from\-file\fR flag. A basic
channel can also be specified through command line flags. If a channel is
specified through \f5\-\-channel\-content\fR or
\f5\-\-channel\-content\-from\-file\fR, and additional flags are supplied, the
flags will override the given channel's settings.

For information about the JSON/YAML format of a notification channel:
https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.notificationChannels

Additional documentation can for this operation can be found at:
https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/alerts/using\-channels\-api


.SH "EXAMPLES"
The following commands setup both email and SMS notification channels for the
team lead. Note that the display name and description focus on the
purpose/semantics of the channel rather than its destination. This is a
best\-practice that facilitates swapping/updating notification channels
in\-place (such as when users change teams, projects, roles, companies, etc.)
with minimal impact to the alerting policies that reference the existing
channels. It is also a best practice to supply at least two channels of
different types for a given person.

Notification channel settings

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-channel\-labels\fR=[\fIKEY\fR=\fIVALUE\fR,...]
List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens (\f5\-\fR),
underscores (\f5_\fR), lowercase characters, and numbers.

These are configuration fields that define the channel and its behavior.If the
channel was given as a JSON/YAML object from a string or file, this flag will
replace the labels value in the given channel.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-description\fR=\fIDESCRIPTION\fR
An optional description for the channel.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-display\-name\fR=\fIDISPLAY_NAME\fR
The display name for the channel.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-enabled\fR
Whether notifications are forwarded to the described channel. Enabled by
default, use \fB\-\-no\-enabled\fR to disable.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-type\fR=\fITYPE\fR
The type of the notification channel. This field matches the value of the
NotificationChannelDescriptor type field.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-user\-labels\fR=[\fIKEY\fR=\fIVALUE\fR,...]
List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens (\f5\-\fR),
underscores (\f5_\fR), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must contain
only hyphens (\f5\-\fR), underscores (\f5_\fR), lowercase characters, and
