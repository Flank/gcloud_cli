.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(BETA)\fR An endpoint contains one or more deployed models, all of which must
have the same interface but may come from different models. An endpoint is to
obtain online prediction and explanation from one of its deployed models.

When you communicate with AI Platform services, you identify a specific endpoint
that is deployed in the cloud using a combination of the current project, the
region, and the endpoint.
