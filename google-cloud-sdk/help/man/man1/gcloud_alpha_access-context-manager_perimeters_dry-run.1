.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR A Service Perimeter describes a set of Google Cloud Platform.RS 2m
resources which can freely import and export data amongst themselves,
but not externally, by default.

.RE

.RS 2m
A dry\-run mode configuration (also known as the Service Perimeter
`spec`) makes it possible to understand the impact of any changes to a
VPC Service Controls policy change before committing the change to the
enforcement mode configuration.
.RE

.RS 2m
Note: For Service Perimeters without an explicit dry\-run mode
configuration, the enforcement mode configuration is used as the dry\-run
mode configuration, resulting in no audit logs being generated.
