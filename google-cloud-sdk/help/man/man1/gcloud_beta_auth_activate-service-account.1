gcloud beta auth activate\-service\-account \- authorize gcloud to access Cloud Platform with a Google service account



.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP
\f5gcloud beta auth activate\-service\-account\fR [\fIACCOUNT\fR] \fB\-\-key\-file\fR=\fIKEY_FILE\fR [\fB\-\-password\-file\fR=\fIPASSWORD_FILE\fR\ |\ \fB\-\-prompt\-for\-password\fR] [\fIGCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG\ ...\fR]



.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(BETA)\fR If you want gcloud (and other tools in the Cloud SDK) to use
service account credentials to make requests, use this command to import these
credentials from a file that contains a private authorization key, and activate
them for use in gcloud. This command serves the same function as \f5\fIgcloud
auth login\fR\fR but for using a service account rather than your Google user
credentials.

For more information on authorization and credential types, see:
https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/authorizing.

The key file for this command can be obtained using either:
.RS 2m
.IP "\(bu" 2m
the Cloud Platform console (https://console.cloud.google.com) or
.IP "\(bu" 2m
$ gcloud iam service\-accounts keys create.
.RE
.sp

The key file can be .json (preferred) or .p12 (legacy) format. For legacy .p12
files, a separate password might be required. This password is displayed in the
console when you create the key.

The credentials will also be activated, which is same as running $ gcloud config
set account ACCOUNT_NAME.

If you specify a project using the \f5\-\-project\fR flag, the project is set in
your active configuration, which is same as running $ gcloud config set project
PROJECT_NAME.

Any previously active credentials will still be retained, and can be seen by
running $ gcloud auth list. They will just no longer be the active/default
credentials.

If you want to delete previous credentials see \f5gcloud auth revoke\fR command.

Note: Service accounts use client quotas for tracking usage.
