.SH "NAME"
.HP
gcloud alpha access\-context\-manager perimeters dry\-run describe \- display the dry\-run mode configuration for a Service Perimeter



.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP
\f5gcloud alpha access\-context\-manager perimeters dry\-run describe\fR (\fIPERIMETER\fR\ :\ \fB\-\-policy\fR=\fIPOLICY\fR) [\fIGCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG\ ...\fR]



.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR The dry\-run mode configuration is presented as a diff against the
enforcement mode configuration. '+' indicates additions, '\-' indicates removals
and entries without either of those indicate that they are the same across the
dry\-run and the enforcement mode configurations. When a particular field is
completely empty, it is displayed as 'NONE'.

Note: When this command is executed on a Service Perimeter with no explicit
dry\-run mode configuration, the effective dry\-run mode configuration is
inherited from the enforcement mode configuration, and thus, the enforcement
mode configuration is displayed in such cases.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"
