\fB\-\-async\fR
Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to complete.

the [run/region] property to specify a Cloud Run region.
.TP 2m
\fBgke\fR

and \f5\-\-cluster\-location\fR flags or set the [run/cluster] and
[run/cluster_location] properties to specify a cluster in a given zone.
.TP 2m
\fBkubernetes\fR

.TP 2m

Only applicable if connecting to Cloud Run for Anthos deployed on GKE. Specify
\'\-\-platform=gke' to use:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m

Cluster resource \- Kubernetes Engine cluster to connect to. The arguments in
this group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some
attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.
To set the [project] attribute: provide the argument [\-\-cluster] on the
command line with a fully specified name; set the property [run/cluster] with a
fully specified name; specify the cluster from a list of available clusters with
a fully specified name; provide the argument [\-\-project] on the command line;
set the property [core/project].

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-cluster\fR=\fICLUSTER\fR
ID of the cluster or fully qualified identifier for the cluster.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-cluster\-location\fR=\fICLUSTER_LOCATION\fR
Zone in which the cluster is located. Alternatively, set the property
[run/cluster_location].

At most one of these may be specified:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-to\-latest\fR
True to assign 100 percent of traffic to the 'latest' revision of this service.
Note that when a new revision is created, it will become the 'latest' and
traffic will be directed to it. Defaults to False.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-to\-revisions\fR=[\fIREVISION\-NAME\fR=\fIPERCENTAGE\fR,...]
Comma separated list of traffic assignments in the form
REVISION\-NAME=PERCENTAGE. REVISION\-NAME must be the name for a revision for
the service as returned by 'gcloud beta run list revisions'. PERCENTAGE must be
an integer percentage between 0 and 100 inclusive. Ex
service\-nw9hs=10,service\-nw9hs=20 Up to 100 percent of traffic may be
assigned. If 100 percent of traffic is assigned, the Service traffic is updated
as specified. If under 100 percent of traffic is assigned, the Service traffic
is updated as specified for revisions with assignments and traffic is scaled up
or down down proportionally as needed for revision that are currently serving
traffic but that do not have new assignments. For example assume revision\-1 is
serving 40 percent of traffic and revision\-2 is serving 60 percent. If
revision\-1 is assigned 45 percent of traffic and no assignment is made for
revision\-2, the service is updated with revsion\-1 assigned 45 percent of
traffic and revision\-2 scaled down to 55 percent.
