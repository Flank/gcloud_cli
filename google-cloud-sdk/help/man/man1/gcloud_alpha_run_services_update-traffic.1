.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-async\fR
Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to complete.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-platform\fR=\fIPLATFORM\fR

[run/platform]. If not specified, the user will be prompted to choose a
platform. \fIPLATFORM\fR must be one of:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m

.TP 2m

Specify traffic tags. Traffic tags can be assigned to a revision by name or to
the latest ready revision. Assigning a tag to a revision generates a URL
prefixed with the tag that allows addressing that revision directly, regardless
of the percent traffic specified. Keys are tags. Values are revision names or
"LATEST" for the latest ready revision. For example,
\-\-set\-tags=candidate=LATEST,current=myservice\-v1 assigns the tag "candidate"
to the latest ready revision and the tag "current" to the revision with name
"myservice\-v1" and clears any existing tags. Changing tags does not affect the
traffic percentage assigned to revisions. When using a tags flag and one or more
of \-\-to\-latest and \-\-to\-revisions in the same command, the tags change
occurs first then the traffic percentage change occurs. At most one of these may
be specified:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-clear\-tags\fR
Remove all tags.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-set\-tags\fR=[\fITAG\fR=\fIREVISION\fR,...]
List of key\-value pairs to set as tags. All existing tags will be removed
first.

.TP 2m

Only \-\-update\-tags and \-\-remove\-tags can be used together. If both are
specified, \-\-remove\-tags will be applied first.

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-remove\-tags\fR=[\fITAG\fR,...]
List of tags to be removed.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-update\-tags\fR=[\fITAG\fR=\fIREVISION\fR,...]
List of key\-value pairs to set as tags.

.TP 2m

Cluster resource \- Kubernetes Engine cluster to connect to. The arguments in
this group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some
attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.
To set the [project] attribute: provide the argument [\-\-cluster] on the
command line with a fully specified name; set the property [run/cluster] with a
fully specified name; specify the cluster from a list of available clusters with
a fully specified name; provide the argument [\-\-project] on the command line;
set the property [core/project].

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-cluster\fR=\fICLUSTER\fR
ID of the cluster or fully qualified identifier for the cluster.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-cluster\-location\fR=\fICLUSTER_LOCATION\fR
Zone in which the cluster is located. Alternatively, set the property
[run/cluster_location].

Only applicable if connecting to Cloud Run for Anthos deployed on VMware.
Specify \f5\-\-platform=kubernetes\fR to use:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-context\fR=\fICONTEXT\fR
The name of the context in your kubectl config file to use for connecting.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-kubeconfig\fR=\fIKUBECONFIG\fR

At most one of these may be specified:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-to\-latest\fR
True to assign 100 percent of traffic to the 'latest' revision of this service.
Note that when a new revision is created, it will become the 'latest' and
traffic will be directed to it. Defaults to False. Synonymous with
\'\-\-to\-revisions=LATEST=100'.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-to\-revisions\fR=[\fIREVISION\-NAME\fR=\fIPERCENTAGE\fR,...]
Comma separated list of traffic assignments in the form
REVISION\-NAME=PERCENTAGE. REVISION\-NAME must be the name for a revision for
the service as returned by 'gcloud beta run list revisions'. PERCENTAGE must be
an integer percentage between 0 and 100 inclusive. Ex
service\-nw9hs=10,service\-nw9hs=20 Up to 100 percent of traffic may be
assigned. If 100 percent of traffic is assigned, the Service traffic is updated
as specified. If under 100 percent of traffic is assigned, the Service traffic
is updated as specified for revisions with assignments and traffic is scaled up
or down down proportionally as needed for revision that are currently serving
traffic but that do not have new assignments. For example assume revision\-1 is
serving 40 percent of traffic and revision\-2 is serving 60 percent. If
revision\-1 is assigned 45 percent of traffic and no assignment is made for
revision\-2, the service is updated with revsion\-1 assigned 45 percent of
traffic and revision\-2 scaled down to 55 percent. You can use "LATEST" as a
special revision name to always put the given percentage of traffic on the
latest ready revision.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-to\-tags\fR=[\fITAG\fR=\fIPERCENTAGE\fR,...]
Comma separated list of traffic assignments in the form TAG=PERCENTAGE. TAG must
match a traffic tag on a revision of the service. It may match a previously\-set
tag, or one assigned using the \f5\-\-set\-tags\fR or \f5\-\-update\-tags\fR
flags on this command. PERCENTAGE must be an integer percentage between 0 and
100 inclusive. Up to 100 percent of traffic may be assigned. If 100 percent of
traffic is assigned, the service traffic is updated as specified. If under 100
percent of traffic is assigned, the service traffic is updated as specified to
the given tags, and other traffic is scaled up or down proportionally. For
example, assume the revision tagged \f5next\fR is serving 40 percent of traffic
and the revision tagged \f5current\fR is serving 60 percent. If \f5next\fR is
assigned 45 percent of traffic and no assignment is made for \f5current\fR, the
service is updated with \f5next\fR assigned 45 percent of traffic and
\f5current\fR scaled down to 55 percent.

.SH "EXAMPLES"

To assign 10% of traffic to revision myservice\-s5sxn and 90% of traffic to
revision myservice\-cp9kw run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha run services update\-traffic myservice \e
  \-\-to\-revisions=myservice\-s5sxn=10,myservice\-cp9kw=90
.RE

To increase the traffic to revision myservice\-s5sxn to 20% and by reducing the
traffic to revision myservice\-cp9kw to 80% run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha run services update\-traffic myservice \e
  \-\-to\-revisions=myservice\-s5sxn=20
.RE

To rollback to revision myservice\-cp9kw run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha run services update\-traffic myservice \e
  \-\-to\-revisions=myservice\-cp9kw=100
.RE

To assign 100% of traffic to the current or future LATEST revision run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha run services update\-traffic myservice \-\-to\-latest
.RE

You can also refer to the current or future LATEST revision in \-\-to\-revisions
by the string "LATEST". For example, to set 10% of traffic to always float to
the latest revision:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha run services update\-traffic myservice \e
  \-\-to\-revisions=LATEST=10
