.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR Retrieves the job logs from a specified job using the Dataflow
Messages API with at least the specified importance level. Can also be used to
display logs between a given time period using the \-\-before and \-\-after
flags. These logs are produced by the service and are distinct from worker logs.
Worker logs can be found in Cloud Logging.

.SH "FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-after\fR=\fIAFTER\fR
Only display messages logged after the given time. See $ gcloud topic datetimes
for information on time formats. For example, \f52018\-01\-01\fR is the first
day of the year, and \f5\-P2W\fR is 2 weeks ago.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-before\fR=\fIBEFORE\fR
Only display messages logged before the given time. See $ gcloud topic datetimes
for information on time formats.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-importance\fR=\fIIMPORTANCE\fR; default="warning"
Minimum importance a message must have to be displayed. \fIIMPORTANCE\fR must be
one of: \fBdebug\fR, \fBdetailed\fR, \fBwarning\fR, \fBerror\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-region\fR=\fIREGION_ID\fR
The region ID of the job's regional endpoint. Defaults to 'us\-central1'.

.SH "LIST COMMAND FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-filter\fR=\fIEXPRESSION\fR
Apply a Boolean filter \fIEXPRESSION\fR to each resource item to be listed. If
the expression evaluates \f5True\fR, then that item is listed. For more details
and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters. This flag
interacts with other flags that are applied in this order: \fB\-\-flatten\fR,
\fB\-\-sort\-by\fR, \fB\-\-filter\fR, \fB\-\-limit\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-limit\fR=\fILIMIT\fR
Maximum number of resources to list. The default is \fBunlimited\fR. This flag
interacts with other flags that are applied in this order: \fB\-\-flatten\fR,
\fB\-\-sort\-by\fR, \fB\-\-filter\fR, \fB\-\-limit\fR.
