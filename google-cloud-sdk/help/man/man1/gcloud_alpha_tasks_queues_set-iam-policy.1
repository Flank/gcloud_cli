gcloud alpha tasks queues set\-iam\-policy \- set the IAM policy for a queue



.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP
\f5gcloud alpha tasks queues set\-iam\-policy\fR (\fIQUEUE\fR\ :\ \fB\-\-location\fR=\fILOCATION\fR) \fIPOLICY_FILE\fR [\fIGCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG\ ...\fR]



.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR This command replaces the existing IAM policy for a queue, given a
queue and a file encoded in JSON or YAML that contains the IAM policy. If the
given policy file specifies an "etag" value, then the replacement will succeed
only if the policy already in place matches that etag. (An etag obtained via
\f5get\-iam\-policy\fR will prevent the replacement if the policy for the queue
has been subsequently updated.) A policy file that does not contain an etag
value will replace any existing policy for the queue.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.TP 2m

Queue resource \- The queue for which to set the IAM policy. The arguments in
this group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some
attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.
To set the [project] attribute: provide the argument [queue] on the command line
with a fully specified name; provide the argument [\-\-project] on the command
line; set the property [core/project]. This must be specified.

.RS 2m
