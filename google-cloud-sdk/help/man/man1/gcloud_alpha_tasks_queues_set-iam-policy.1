gcloud alpha tasks queues set\-iam\-policy \- set the IAM policy for a queue



.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP
\f5gcloud alpha tasks queues set\-iam\-policy\fR (\fIQUEUE\fR\ :\ \fB\-\-location\fR=\fILOCATION\fR) \fIPOLICY_FILE\fR [\fIGCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG\ ...\fR]



.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR This command replaces the existing IAM policy for a queue, given a
queue and a file encoded in JSON or YAML that contains the IAM policy. If the
given policy file specifies an "etag" value, then the replacement will succeed
only if the policy already in place matches that etag. (An etag obtained via
\f5get\-iam\-policy\fR will prevent the replacement if the policy for the queue
has been subsequently updated.) A policy file that does not contain an etag
value will replace any existing policy for the queue.
