.SH "REQUIRED FLAGS"

.RS 2m

\fB\-\-plan\fR=\fIPLAN\fR
Duration of the commitment. \fIPLAN\fR must be one of: \fB12\-month\fR,
\fB36\-month\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-resources\fR=[\fIRESOURCE\fR=\fICOMMITMENT\fR,...]
Resources to be included in the commitment commitment:
.RS 2m
.IP "\(em" 2m
MEMORY should include unit (eg. 3072MB or 9GB). If no units are specified, GB is
assumed.
.IP "\(em" 2m
VCPU is number of committed cores.
.RE
.RE
.sp
Ratio between number of VCPU cores and memory must conform to limits described
on:
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/creating\-instance\-with\-custom\-machine\-type



.SH "OPTIONAL FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-region\fR=\fIREGION\fR
Region of the commitment to create. If not specified, you may be prompted to
select a region.

To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
\f5\fIcompute/region\fR\fR property:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config set compute/region REGION
.RE

A list of regions can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute regions list
.RE

To unset the property, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config unset compute/region
.RE

Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
\f5\fICLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION\fR\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-type\fR=\fITYPE\fR; default="general\-purpose"
Type of commitment. \f5memory\-optimized\fR indicates that the commitment is for
memory\-optimized VMs. \fITYPE\fR must be one of: \fBgeneral\-purpose\fR,
\fBmemory\-optimized\fR.
