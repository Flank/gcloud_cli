.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m

Workerpool resource \- Arguments and flags specifying the worker pool you want
to create. The arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of
this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
can be set in other ways. To set the [project] attribute: provide the argument
[workerpool] on the command line with a fully specified name; provide the
argument [\-\-project] on the command line; set the property [core/project].
This must be specified.

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fIWORKERPOOL\fR
ID of the workerpool or fully qualified identifier for the workerpool. This
positional must be specified if any of the other arguments in this group are
specified.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-instance\fR=\fIINSTANCE\fR
Instance name.

.SH "OPTIONAL FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-async\fR
Display information about the operation in progress, without waiting for the
operation to complete.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-disk\-size\fR=\fIDISK_SIZE\fR; default=200
Size of the disk, in Gb, for each worker. Defaults to 200Gb.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-machine\-type\fR=\fIMACHINE_TYPE\fR; default="n1\-standard\-2"
Type of VM to use for each worker. To get a list of valid machine types, use the
following command:

$ gcloud compute machine\-types list

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-min\-cpu\-platform\fR=\fIMIN_CPU_PLATFORM\fR
Minimum CPU platform for the workers. For more information see
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/cpu\-platforms.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-reserved\fR
Determines the type of VM to use. If set then reserved VMs are used, otherwise
preemptable VMs are used.

.SH "API REFERENCE"

This command uses the \fBremotebuildexecution/v1alpha\fR API. The full
documentation for this API can be found at:
https://cloud.google.com/remote\-build\-execution/docs/



.SH "EXAMPLES"

The following command creates a worker pool called 'pool1' in the instance
called 'default_instance' with 25 workers configured with default machine type
(n1\-standard\-2) and disk size (200Gb):

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha remote\-build\-execution worker\-pools create pool1 \e
    \-\-instance=default_instance \-\-worker\-count=25
.RE

The following command creates a worker pool called 'heftypool' in the instance
called 'default_instance' with 5 workers configured with 64 cores and 2000Gb
disks:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha remote\-build\-execution worker\-pools create \e
    heftypool \-\-instance=default_instance \-\-worker\-count=5 \e
    \-\-disk\-size=2000 \-\-machine\-type=n1\-standard\-64

command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right project,
you will have to apply for early access and have your projects registered on the
