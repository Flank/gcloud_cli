.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-compare\-duration\fR=\fICOMPARE_DURATION\fR
ListAssetResult's "state" attribute is updated to indicate whether the asset was
added, removed, or remained present during the compare_duration period of time
that precedes the read_time. Example duration: "100000s"

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-field\-mask\fR=\fIFIELD_MASK\fR
Field mask to specify the Asset fields to be listed in the response. An empty
field mask will list all fields. Example field mask:
"asset.security_center_properties.resource_type,asset.security_center_properties.resource_parent"

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-order\-by\fR=\fIORDER_BY\fR
Expression that defines what fields and order to use for sorting. Example order
by: "resource_properties.sort_prop ASC"

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-page\-token\fR=\fIPAGE_TOKEN\fR
The value returned by the last 'ListAssetsResponse'; indicates that this is a
continuation of a prior 'ListAssets' call, and that the system should return the
next page of data.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-read\-time\fR=\fIREAD_TIME\fR
Time used as a reference point when filtering assets. Default: NOW Example read
time: "2019\-02\-28T07:00:06.861Z"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-filter\fR=\fIEXPRESSION\fR
Apply a Boolean filter \fIEXPRESSION\fR to each resource item to be listed. If
the expression evaluates \f5True\fR, then that item is listed. For more details
and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters. This flag
interacts with other flags that are applied in this order: \fB\-\-flatten\fR,
\fB\-\-sort\-by\fR, \fB\-\-filter\fR, \fB\-\-limit\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-limit\fR=\fILIMIT\fR
Maximum number of resources to list. The default is \fBunlimited\fR. This flag
interacts with other flags that are applied in this order: \fB\-\-flatten\fR,
\fB\-\-sort\-by\fR, \fB\-\-filter\fR, \fB\-\-limit\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-page\-size\fR=\fIPAGE_SIZE\fR
Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag specifies the
maximum number of resources per page. The default is determined by the service
if it supports paging, otherwise it is \fBunlimited\fR (no paging). Paging may
be applied before or after \fB\-\-filter\fR and \fB\-\-limit\fR depending on the
service.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-sort\-by\fR=[\fIFIELD\fR,...]
Comma\-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The default order
is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending order on that field. This
flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
\fB\-\-flatten\fR, \fB\-\-sort\-by\fR, \fB\-\-filter\fR, \fB\-\-limit\fR.
