.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR Cancel a running operation.

Cancel is a best\-effort method for aborting a running operation. Operations
that have already completed can not be cancelled. If the operation has passed
the "point of no\-return", cancel will have no effect.

An example of "point of no\-return" in the context of Upgrade operations would
be if all the nodes have been upgraded but the operation hasn't been marked as
complete.
