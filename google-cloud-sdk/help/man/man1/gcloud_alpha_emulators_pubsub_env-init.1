gcloud alpha emulators pubsub env\-init \- print the commands required to export pubsub emulator's env variables



.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP
\f5gcloud alpha emulators pubsub env\-init\fR [\fB\-\-data\-dir\fR=\fIDATA_DIR\fR] [\fIGCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG\ ...\fR]



.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR After starting the emulator, you need to set environment variables
so that your application connects to the emulator instead of the production
environment. Environment variables need to be set each time you start the
emulator. The environment variables depend on dynamically assigned port numbers
that could change when you restart the emulator.



.SH "FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-data\-dir\fR=\fIDATA_DIR\fR
The directory to be used to store/retrieve data/config for an emulator run. The
default value is \f5<USER_CONFIG_DIR>/emulators/pubsub\fR. The value of
USER_CONFIG_DIR can be found by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud info \-\-format='get(config.paths.global_config_dir)'
