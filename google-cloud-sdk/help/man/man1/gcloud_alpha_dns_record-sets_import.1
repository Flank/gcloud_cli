.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR This command imports record\-sets contained within the specified
record\-sets file into your managed\-zone. Note that NS records for the origin
of the zone and the SOA NS field are not imported since name\-servers are
managed by Cloud DNS. By default, record\-sets cannot be imported if there are
any conflicts. A conflict exists if an existing record\-set has the same name
and type as a record\-set that is being imported. In contrast, if the
\-\-delete\-all\-existing flag is used, the imported record\-sets will replace
all the records\-sets currently in the managed\-zone.
