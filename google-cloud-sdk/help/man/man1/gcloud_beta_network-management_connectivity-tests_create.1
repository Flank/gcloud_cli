.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m

Connectivity test resource \- Name of the connectivity test you want to create.
This represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments
in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the [project] attribute:
provide the argument [connectivity_test] on the command line with a fully
specified name; set the property [core/project]; provide the argument
[\-\-project] on the command line. This must be specified.

.RS 2m

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-destination\-ip\-address\fR=\fIDESTINATION_IP_ADDRESS\fR
