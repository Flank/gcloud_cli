.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR Remove an IAM policy binding from the IAM policy of a service
account. A binding consists of at least one member, a role, and an optional
condition.

When managing IAM roles, you can treat a service account either as a resource or
as an identity. This command is to remove a policy binding from a service
account resource. There are other gcloud commands to manage IAM policies for
other types of resources. For example, to manage IAM policies on a project, use
the $ gcloud projects commands.

attribute: provide the argument [service_account] on the command line with a
fully specified name; set the property [core/project]; provide the argument
[\-\-project] on the command line. This must be specified.
