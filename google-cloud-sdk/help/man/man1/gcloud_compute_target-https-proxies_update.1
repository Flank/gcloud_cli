.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fBgcloud compute target\-https\-proxies update\fR is used to change the SSL
certificate and/or URL map of existing target HTTPS proxies. A target HTTPS
proxy is referenced by one or more forwarding rules which define which packets
the proxy is responsible for routing. The target HTTPS proxy in turn points to a
URL map that defines the rules for routing the requests. The URL map's job is to
map URLs to backend services which handle the actual requests. The target HTTPS
proxy also points to at most 10 SSL certificates used for server\-side
authentication. The target HTTPS proxy can be associated with at most one SSL
policy.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.SH "FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-ssl\-certificates\fR=\fISSL_CERTIFICATE\fR,[...]
References to at most 10 SSL certificate resources that are used for
server\-side authentication. The first SSL certificate in this list is
considered the primary SSL certificate associated with the load balancer. The
SSL certificate must exist and cannot be deleted while referenced by a target
HTTPS proxy.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-url\-map\fR=\fIURL_MAP\fR
A reference to a URL map resource that defines the mapping of URLs to backend
services. The URL map must exist and cannot be deleted while referenced by a
target HTTPS proxy.

.TP 2m

At most one of these may be specified:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-clear\-ssl\-policy\fR
Removes any attached SSL policy from the HTTPS proxy.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-ssl\-policy\fR=\fISSL_POLICY\fR
A reference to an SSL policy resource that defines the server\-side support for
SSL features and affects the connections between clients and the HTTPS proxy
load balancer. The SSL policy must exist and cannot be deleted while referenced
by a target HTTPS proxy.
