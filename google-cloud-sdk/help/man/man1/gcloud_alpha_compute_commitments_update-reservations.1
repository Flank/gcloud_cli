.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR Update the resource shape of reservations within the commitment.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fICOMMITMENT\fR
Name of the commitment to update reservation.


.RE
.sp

.SH "FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-region\fR=\fIREGION\fR
Region of the commitment to update reservation. If not specified, you may be
prompted to select a region.

To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
\f5\fIcompute/region\fR\fR property:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config set compute/region REGION
.RE

A list of regions can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute regions list
.RE

To unset the property, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config unset compute/region
.RE

Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
\f5\fICLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION\fR\fR.

.TP 2m

Manage reservations that are attached to the commitment. At most one of these
may be specified:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-reservations\-from\-file\fR=\fIRESERVATIONS_FROM_FILE\fR
Path to a YAML file of two reservations' configuration.

.TP 2m

Specify source and destination reservations configuration.

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-dest\-reservation\fR=[\fImachine\-type\fR=\fIMACHINE\-TYPE\fR],[\fImin\-cpu\-platform\fR=\fIMIN\-CPU\-PLATFORM\fR],[\fIrequire\-specific\-reservation\fR=\fIREQUIRE\-SPECIFIC\-RESERVATION\fR],[\fIreservation\fR=\fIRESERVATION\fR],[\fIreservation\-zone\fR=\fIRESERVATION\-ZONE\fR],[\fIvm\-count\fR=\fIVM\-COUNT\fR]
destination reservation configuration.
.RE
.sp
.TP 2m
\fBreservation\fR
Name of the destination reservation to operate on.
.TP 2m
\fBreservation\-zone\fR
Zone of the destination reservation to operate on.
.TP 2m
\fBvm\-count\fR
The number of VM instances that are allocated to this reservation. The value of
this field must be an int in the range [1, 1000].
.TP 2m
\fBmachine\-type\fR
The type of machine (name only) which has a fixed number of vCPUs and a fixed
amount of memory. This also includes specifying custom machine type following
\f5custom\-number_of_CPUs\-amount_of_memory\fR pattern, e.g.
\f5custom\-32\-29440\fR.
.TP 2m
\fBmin\-cpu\-platform\fR
Optional minimum CPU platform of the reservation to create.
.TP 2m
\fBrequire\-specific\-reservation\fR
Indicates whether the reservation can be consumed by VMs with "any reservation"
defined. If enabled, then only VMs that target this reservation by name using
\f5\-\-reservation\-affinity=specific\fR can consume from this reservation. This
flag must be specified if any of the other arguments in this group are
specified.

Name of the source reservation to operate on.
.TP 2m
\fBreservation\-zone\fR
Zone of the source reservation to operate on.

.TP 2m
\fBtype\fR
The specific type (e.g. \f5nvidia\-tesla\-k80\fR for nVidia Tesla K80) of
