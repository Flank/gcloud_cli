.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR Though you can use legacy HTTPS health checks in certain Google
Cloud Platform load balancing configurations and for managed instance group
autohealing, you should consider a non\-legacy HTTPS health check created with
\f5health\-checks create https\fR instead.

For more information about the differences between legacy and non\-legacy health
checks see:
https://cloud.google.com/load\-balancing/docs/health\-check\-concepts#category_and_protocol

For information about what type of health check to use for a particular load
balancer, see:
https://cloud.google.com/load\-balancing/docs/health\-check\-concepts#lb_guide

Name of the HTTPS health check to create.

.SH "FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-check\-interval\fR=\fICHECK_INTERVAL\fR; default="5s"
How often to perform a health check for an instance. For example, specifying
\f5\fI10s\fR\fR will run the check every 10 seconds. The default value is
\f5\fI5s\fR\fR. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on duration
formats.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-description\fR=\fIDESCRIPTION\fR
An optional, textual description for the HTTPS health check.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-healthy\-threshold\fR=\fIHEALTHY_THRESHOLD\fR; default=2
The number of consecutive successful health checks before an unhealthy instance
is marked as healthy. The default is 2.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-host\fR=\fIHOST\fR
The value of the host header used in this HTTPS health check request. By
default, this is empty and Compute Engine automatically sets the host header in
health requests to the same external IP address as the forwarding rule
associated with the target pool.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-port\fR=\fIPORT\fR; default=443
The TCP port number that this health check monitors. The default value is 443.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-request\-path\fR=\fIREQUEST_PATH\fR; default="/"
The request path that this health check monitors. For example,
\f5\fI/healthcheck\fR\fR. The default value is ``/''.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-timeout\fR=\fITIMEOUT\fR; default="5s"
If Compute Engine doesn't receive an HTTPS 200 response from the instance by the
time specified by the value of this flag, the health check request is considered
a failure. For example, specifying \f5\fI10s\fR\fR will cause the check to wait
for 10 seconds before considering the request a failure. The default value is
\f5\fI5s\fR\fR. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on duration
formats.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-unhealthy\-threshold\fR=\fIUNHEALTHY_THRESHOLD\fR; default=2
The number of consecutive health check failures before a healthy instance is
marked as unhealthy. The default is 2.
