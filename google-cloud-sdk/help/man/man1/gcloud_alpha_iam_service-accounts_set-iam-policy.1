.SH "NAME"
.HP
gcloud alpha iam service\-accounts set\-iam\-policy \- set IAM policy for a service account



.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP
\f5gcloud alpha iam service\-accounts set\-iam\-policy\fR \fISERVICE_ACCOUNT\fR \fIPOLICY_FILE\fR [\fIGCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG\ ...\fR]



.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR This command replaces the existing IAM policy for a service
account, given an IAM_ACCOUNT and a file encoded in JSON or YAML that contains
the IAM policy. If the given policy file specifies an "etag" value, then the
replacement will succeed only if the policy already in place matches that etag.
(An etag obtained via $ gcloud iam service\-accounts get\-iam\-policy will
prevent the replacement if the policy for the service account has been
subsequently updated.) A policy file that does not contain an etag value will
replace any existing policy for the service account.

When managing IAM roles, you can treat a service account either as a resource or
as an identity. This command is to set the iam policy of a service account
resource. There are other gcloud commands to manage IAM policies for other types
of resources. For example, to manage IAM policies on a project, use the \f5$
gcloud projects\fR commands.
