.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR The DLP API lets you understand and manage sensitive data. It
provides fast, scalable classification and optional redaction for sensitive data
elements like credit card numbers, names, Social Security numbers, passport
numbers, US and selected international driver's license numbers, and phone
numbers. The API classifies this data using more than 50 predefined detectors to
identify patterns, formats, and checksums, and even understands contextual
clues. The API supports text and images; just send data to the API or specify
data stored on your Google Cloud Storage, BigQuery, or Cloud Datastore
instances.
