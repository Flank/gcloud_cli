.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR The gcloud iam command group lets you manage Google Cloud Identity
& Access Management (IAM) service accounts and keys.

Cloud IAM authorizes who can take action on specific resources, giving you full
control and visibility to manage cloud resources centrally. For established
enterprises with complex organizational structures, hundreds of workgroups and
potentially many more projects, Cloud IAM provides a unified view into security
policy across your entire organization, with built\-in auditing to ease
compliance processes.

More information on Cloud IAM can be found here: https://cloud.google.com/iam
and detailed documentation can be found here: https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/
