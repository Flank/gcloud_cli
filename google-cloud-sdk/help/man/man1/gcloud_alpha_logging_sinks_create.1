.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR Creates a sink used to export entries from one or more logs to a
destination. A sink exports all logs that matches \fB\-\-log\-filter\fR flag. An
empty filter matches all logs. The sink's destination can be a Cloud Storage
bucket, a BigQuery dataset, or a Cloud Pub/Sub topic. The destination must
already exist and Cloud Logging must have permission to write to it. Log entries
are exported as soon as the sink is created. See
https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/export/configure_export_v2#dest\-auth.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fISINK_NAME\fR
The name for the sink.

.TP 2m
\fIDESTINATION\fR
The destination for the sink.

.SH "FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-description\fR=\fIDESCRIPTION\fR
Description of the sink.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-disabled\fR
Sink will be disabled. Disabled sinks do not export logs.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-exclusion\fR=[\fIdescription\fR=\fIDESCRIPTION\fR],[\fIdisabled\fR=\fIDISABLED\fR],[\fIfilter\fR=\fIFILTER\fR],[\fIname\fR=\fINAME\fR]
Specify an exclusion filter for a log entry that is not to be exported. This
flag can be repeated.

The \f5\fIname\fR\fR and \f5\fIfilter\fR\fR attributes are required. The
following keys are accepted:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fBname\fR
An identifier, such as \f5\fIload\-balancer\-exclusion\fR\fR. Identifiers are
limited to 100 characters and can include only letters, digits, underscores,
hyphens, and periods.

.TP 2m
\fBdescription\fR
A description of this exclusion.

.TP 2m
\fBfilter\fR
An advanced log filter that matches the log entries to be excluded.

.TP 2m
\fBdisabled\fR
If this exclusion should be disabled and not exclude the log entries.
.RE
.sp
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-include\-children\fR
Whether to export logs from all child projects and folders. Only applies to
sinks for organizations and folders.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-log\-filter\fR=\fILOG_FILTER\fR
A filter expression for the sink. If present, the filter specifies which log
entries to export.

.TP 2m

Settings for sink exporting data to BigQuery.

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-use\-partitioned\-tables\fR
If specified, use BigQuery's partitioned tables. By default, Logging creates
dated tables based on the log entries' timestamps, e.g. 'syslog_20170523'.
Partitioned tables remove the suffix and special query syntax
(https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/querying\-partitioned\-tables) must be
used.

.RE
.sp
.TP 2m

At most one of these may be specified:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-billing\-account\fR=\fIBILLING_ACCOUNT_ID\fR
Create a sink associated with this billing account.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-folder\fR=\fIFOLDER_ID\fR
Create a sink associated with this folder.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-organization\fR=\fIORGANIZATION_ID\fR
Create a sink associated with this organization.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-project\fR=\fIPROJECT_ID\fR
Create a sink associated with this project.

The Google Cloud Platform project ID to use for this invocation. If omitted,
then the current project is assumed; the current project can be listed using
\f5gcloud config list \-\-format='text(core.project)'\fR and can be set using
\f5gcloud config set project PROJECTID\fR.

\f5\-\-project\fR and its fallback \f5core/project\fR property play two roles in
the invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate on. It also
specifies the project for API enablement check, quota, and billing. To specify a
different project for quota and billing, use \f5\-\-billing\-project\fR or
\f5billing/quota_project\fR property.

.TP 2m

Settings for Cloud DLP enabled sinks.

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-dlp\-deidentify\-template\fR=\fIDLP_DEIDENTIFY_TEMPLATE\fR
Relative path to a Cloud DLP de\-identification template resource. For example
"projects/my\-project/deidentifyTemplates/my\-template" or
"organizations/my\-org/deidentifyTemplates/my\-template". This flag must be
specified if any of the other arguments in this group are specified.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-dlp\-inspect\-template\fR=\fIDLP_INSPECT_TEMPLATE\fR
Relative path to a Cloud DLP inspection template resource. For example
"projects/my\-project/inspectTemplates/my\-template" or
"organizations/my\-org/inspectTemplates/my\-template". This flag must be
specified if any of the other arguments in this group are specified.

you may be trying to access an API with an invitation\-only early access
allowlist. These variants are also available:
