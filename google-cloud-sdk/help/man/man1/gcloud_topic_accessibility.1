gcloud topic accessibility \- reference for \f5Accessibility\fR features



.SH "DESCRIPTION"

The \f5accessibility/screen_reader\fR property when set to true will change some
behavior to make gcloud more screen reader friendly. Currently the following
changes are implemented:

.RS 2m
.IP "\(bu" 2m
For progress trackers, instead of unicode spinners, the phrase 'working' will be
displayed on stderr, every second while gcloud is working.
.IP "\(bu" 2m
For progress bars, progress will be displayed as a percentage, outputted to
stderr.
.IP "\(bu" 2m
Boxed tables will be drawn with ascii characters instead of unicode characters.
Boxed tables are the default outputs of many list commands. Also consider using
the \-\-format flag to define your own format.

To turn this on, run:
