.SH "DESCRIPTION"

machine instances.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m

\fIINSTANCE_NAMES\fR [\fIINSTANCE_NAMES\fR ...]
Names of the instances to delete. For details on valid instance names, refer to
the criteria documented under the field 'name' at:
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances

.SH "FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-zone\fR=\fIZONE\fR
Zone of the instances to delete. If not specified, the user may be prompted to
select a zone. \f5gcloud\fR will attempt to identify the zone by searching for
resources in the user's project. If the zone cannot be determined, the user will
then be prompted with all Google Cloud Platform zones.

To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, the user can set the
\f5\fIcompute/zone\fR\fR property:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE
.RE

A list of zones can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute zones list
.RE

To unset the property, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config unset compute/zone
.RE

Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
\f5\fICLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE\fR\fR.

.TP 2m

At most one of these may be specified:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-delete\-disks\fR=\fIDISK_TYPE\fR
The types of disks to delete with instance deletion regardless of the disks'
auto\-delete configuration. When this flag is provided, the auto\-delete bits on
the attached disks are modified accordingly before the instance deletion
requests are issued. For more information on disk auto\-deletion, see
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/persistent\-disks#updateautodelete.
\fIDISK_TYPE\fR must be one of:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fBall\fR
All disk types.
.TP 2m
\fBboot\fR
The first partition is reserved for the root filesystem.
.TP 2m
\fBdata\fR
A non\-boot disk.
.RE
.sp


.TP 2m
\fB\-\-keep\-disks\fR=\fIDISK_TYPE\fR
The types of disks to not delete with instance deletion regardless of the disks'
auto\-delete configuration. When this flag is provided, the auto\-delete bits on
the attached disks are modified accordingly before the instance deletion
requests are issued. For more information on disk auto\-deletion, see
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/persistent\-disks#updateautodelete.
