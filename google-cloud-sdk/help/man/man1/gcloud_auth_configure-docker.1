.SH "NAME"
.HP
gcloud auth configure\-docker \- register \f5gcloud\fR as a Docker credential helper



.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP
\f5gcloud auth configure\-docker\fR [\fIGCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG\ ...\fR]



.SH "DESCRIPTION"

gcloud auth configure\-docker adds the Docker \f5credHelper\fR entry to Docker's
configuration file, or creates the file if it doesn't exist. This will register
\f5gcloud\fR as the credential helper for all Google\-supported Docker
registries. If the Docker configuration already contains a \f5credHelper\fR
entry, it will be overwritten.

Note, \f5docker\fR and \f5gcloud\fR need to be on the same system \f5PATH\fR to
work correctly.

For more details on Docker credential helpers, see
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/#credential\-helpers.
