.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR \fBgcloud alpha compute instances bulk create\fR facilitates the
creation of multiple Compute Engine virtual machines with a single command. They
offer a number of advantages compared to the single instance creation command.
This includes the ability to automatically pick a zone in which to create
instances based on resource availability, the ability to specify that the
request be atomic or best\-effort, and a faster rate of instance creation.



.SH "REQUIRED FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-predefined\-names\fR=[\fIINSTANCE_NAME\fR,...]
List of predefined names for the Compute Engine virtual machines being created.
If \f5\-\-count\fR is not specified, the number of virtual machines created will
equal the number of names provided.

.TP 2m

Exactly one of these must be specified:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-region\fR=\fIREGION\fR
Region in which to create the Compute Engine virtual machines. Compute Engine
will select a zone in which to create all virtual machines.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-zone\fR=\fIZONE\fR
Zone in which to create the Compute Engine virtual machines.

A list of zones can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute zones list
.RE

To unset the property, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config unset compute/zone
.RE

Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

Number of accelerators to attach to each instance. The default value is 1.

.RE
.sp
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-no\-address\fR
If provided, the instances are not assigned external IP addresses. To pull
container images, you must configure private Google access if using Container
Registry or configure Cloud NAT for instances to access container images
directly. For more information, see:

default, use \fB\-\-no\-boot\-disk\-auto\-delete\fR to disable.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-boot\-disk\-device\-name\fR=\fIBOOT_DISK_DEVICE_NAME\fR
The name the guest operating system will see for the boot disk. This option can
only be specified if a new boot disk is being created (as opposed to mounting an
existing persistent disk).

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-boot\-disk\-size\fR=\fIBOOT_DISK_SIZE\fR
The size of the boot disk. This option can only be specified if a new boot disk
is being created (as opposed to mounting an existing persistent disk). The value
must be a whole number followed by a size unit of \f5\fIKB\fR\fR for kilobyte,
\f5\fIMB\fR\fR for megabyte, \f5\fIGB\fR\fR for gigabyte, or \f5\fITB\fR\fR for
terabyte. For example, \f5\fI10GB\fR\fR will produce a 10 gigabyte disk. The
minimum size a boot disk can have is 10 GB. Disk size must be a multiple of 1
GB. Limit boot disk size to 2 TB to account for MBR partition table limitations.
Default size unit is \f5\fIGB\fR\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-boot\-disk\-type\fR=\fIBOOT_DISK_TYPE\fR
The type of the boot disk. This option can only be specified if a new boot disk

used as a default.

.TP 2m
\fBimage\fR
Specifies the name of the image that the disk will be initialized with. A new
disk will be created based on the given image. To view a list of public images
and projects, run \f5$ gcloud compute images list\fR. It is best practice to use
image when a specific version of an image is needed. If both image and
image\-family flags are omitted a blank disk will be created.

.TP 2m
\fBimage\-family\fR
The image family for the operating system that the boot disk will be initialized
with. Compute Engine offers multiple Linux distributions, some of which are
available as both regular and Shielded VM images. When a family is specified
instead of an image, the latest non\-deprecated image associated with that
family is used. It is best practice to use \-\-image\-family when the latest
version of an image is needed.

.TP 2m
\fBimage\-project\fR
The Google Cloud project against which all image and image family references
will be resolved. It is best practice to define image\-project. A full list of
available projects can be generated by running \f5gcloud projects list\fR.

of \f5\fIKB\fR\fR for kilobyte, \f5\fIMB\fR\fR for megabyte, \f5\fIGB\fR\fR for
gigabyte, or \f5\fITB\fR\fR for terabyte. For example, \f5\fI10GB\fR\fR will
produce a 10 gigabyte disk. Disk size must be a multiple of 1 GB. If not
specified, the default image size will be used for the new disk.

.TP 2m
\fBtype\fR
The type of the disk. To get a list of available disk types, run $ gcloud
compute disk\-types list. The default disk type is \f5\fIpd\-standard\fR\fR.

.TP 2m

An optional name that indicates the disk name the guest operating system will
see. If omitted, a device name of the form \f5persistent\-disk\-N\fR will be
used.

.TP 2m
\fBauto\-delete\fR
If \f5\fIyes\fR\fR, this persistent disk will be automatically deleted when the
instance is deleted. However, if the disk is later detached from the instance,
this option won't apply. The default value for this is \f5\fIyes\fR\fR.

.TP 2m
\fBsource\-snapshot\fR
The source disk snapshot that will be used to create the disk. You can provide
this as a full URL to the snapshot or just the snapshot name. For example, the

\fB\-\-scopes\fR=[\fISCOPE\fR,...]
If not provided, the instance will be assigned the default scopes, described
below. However, if neither \f5\-\-scopes\fR nor \f5\-\-no\-scopes\fR are
specified and the project has no default service account, then the instance will
be created with no scopes. Note that the level of access that a service account
has is determined by a combination of access scopes and IAM roles so you must
configure both access scopes and IAM roles for the service account to work
properly.

SCOPE can be either the full URI of the scope or an alias. \fBdefault\fR scopes
are assigned to all instances. Available aliases are:
