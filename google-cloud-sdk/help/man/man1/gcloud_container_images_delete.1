.SH "EXAMPLES"

Deletes the image as long as there aren't additional, unspecified tags
referencing it:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud container images delete <IMAGE_NAME>
.RE

Deletes the image (and tags) from the input IMAGE_NAME:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud container images delete <IMAGE_NAME> \-\-force\-delete\-tags
.RE

Deletes the image (and tags) from the input IMAGE_NAME, without additional
prompting:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud container images delete <IMAGE_NAME> \-\-force\-delete\-tags \e
    \-\-quiet
.RE

To easily identify and delete untagged images in a project, first filter digests
that lack tags:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud container images list\-tags \e
    [HOSTNAME]/[PROJECT\-ID]/[IMAGE]              \e
    \-\-filter='\-tags:*'  \-\-format='get(digest)' \-\-limit=$BIG_NUMBER
.RE

Then, delete these tagless images without prompting by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud container images delete \e
    \-\-quiet [HOSTNAME]/[PROJECT\-ID]/[IMAGE]@DIGEST
.RE



.SH "NOTES"
