.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR \fBgcloud alpha compute instance\-groups managed resize\fR resize
a managed instance group to a provided size.

If you resize down, the Instance Group Manager service deletes instances from
the group until the group reaches the desired size. Instances are deleted in
arbitrary order but the Instance Group Manager takes into account some
considerations before it chooses which instance to delete. For more information,
see
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instanceGroupManagers/resize.

If you resize up, the service adds instances to the group using the current
instance template until the group reaches the desired size.
