.SH "NAME"
.HP
gcloud app instances ssh \- SSH into the VM of an App Engine Flexible instance



.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP
\f5gcloud app instances ssh\fR \fIINSTANCE\fR [\fB\-\-container\fR=\fICONTAINER\fR] [\fB\-\-service\fR=\fISERVICE\fR] [\fB\-\-version\fR=\fIVERSION\fR] [\fIGCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG\ ...\fR] [\-\-\ \fICOMMAND\fR\ ...]



.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fBgcloud app instances ssh\fR lets you remotely log in to your running App
Engine Flexible instances.

\fBgcloud app instances ssh\fR resolves the instance's IP address and
pre\-populates the VM with a public key managed by gcloud. If the gcloud managed
key pair does not exist, it is generated the first time an SSH command is run,
which may prompt you for a passphrase for the private key encryption.

All SSH commands require the OpenSSH client suite to be installed on Linux and
Mac OS X. On Windows, the Cloud SDK comes with a bundled PuTTY suite instead, so
it has no external dependencies.
