.SH "NAME"
.HP
gcloud compute instances get\-shielded\-identity \- get the Shielded identity for a Compute Engine instance



.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP
\f5gcloud compute instances get\-shielded\-identity\fR \fIINSTANCE_NAME\fR [\fB\-\-zone\fR=\fIZONE\fR] [\fIGCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG\ ...\fR]



.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fBgcloud compute instances get\-shielded\-identity\fR displays the Shielded
identity associated with a Compute Engine instance in a project.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fIINSTANCE_NAME\fR
Name of the instance to describe the Shielded identity of. For details on valid
instance names, refer to the criteria documented under the field 'name' at:
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances

.SH "FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-zone\fR=\fIZONE\fR
Zone of the instance to describe the Shielded identity of. If not specified, the
user may be prompted to select a zone. \f5gcloud\fR will attempt to identify the
zone by searching for resources in the user's project. If the zone cannot be
determined, the user will then be prompted with all Google Cloud Platform zones.

To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, the user can set the
\f5\fIcompute/zone\fR\fR property:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE
.RE

A list of zones can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute zones list
.RE

To unset the property, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config unset compute/zone
.RE

Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
\f5\fICLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE\fR\fR.
