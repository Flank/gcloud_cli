.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR \fBgcloud alpha compute ssl\-policies delete\fR is used to delete
one or more Google Compute Engine SSL policies. SSL policies can only be deleted
when no other resources (e.g., Target HTTPS proxies, Target SSL proxies) refer
to them.

An SSL policy specifies the server\-side support for SSL features. An SSL policy
can be attached to a TargetHttpsProxy or a TargetSslProxy. This affects
connections between clients and the HTTPS or SSL proxy load balancer. SSL
policies do not affect the connection between the load balancers and the
backends.
