.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(BETA)\fR \fBgcloud beta compute ssl\-certificates create\fR is used to
create SSL certificates which can be used to configure a target HTTPS proxy. An
SSL certificate consists of a certificate and private key. The private key is
encrypted before it is stored.

You can create either a managed or a self\-managed SslCertificate. A managed
SslCertificate will be provisioned and renewed for you, when you specify the
\f5\-\-domains\fR flag. A self\-managed certificate is created by passing the
certificate obtained from Certificate Authority through \f5\-\-certificate\fR
and \f5\-\-private\-key\fR flags.

.SH "REQUIRED FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m

Flags for managed or self\-managed certificate. Exactly one of these must be
specified:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-domains\fR=\fIDOMAIN\fR,[\fIDOMAIN\fR,...]
List of domains to create a managed certificate for.

Flags for self\-managed certificate

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-certificate\fR=\fILOCAL_FILE_PATH\fR
Path to a local certificate file to create a self\-managed certificate. The
certificate must be in PEM format. The certificate chain must be no greater than
5 certs long. The chain must include at least one intermediate cert. This flag
must be specified if any of the other arguments in this group are specified.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-private\-key\fR=\fILOCAL_FILE_PATH\fR
Path to a local private key file. The private key must be in PEM format and must
use RSA or ECDSA encryption. This flag must be specified if any of the other
arguments in this group are specified.
