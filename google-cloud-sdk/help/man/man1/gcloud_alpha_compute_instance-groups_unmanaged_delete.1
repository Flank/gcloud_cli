.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR \fBgcloud alpha compute instance\-groups unmanaged delete\fR
deletes one or more Compute Engine unmanaged instance groups. This command just
deletes the instance group and does not delete the individual virtual machine
instances in the instance group. For example:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha compute instance\-groups unmanaged delete \e
    example\-instance\-group\-1 example\-instance\-group\-2 \e
    \-\-zone us\-central1\-a
.RE

The above example deletes two instance groups, example\-instance\-group\-1 and
example\-instance\-group\-2, in the \f5\fIus\-central1\-a\fR\fR zone.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fINAME\fR [\fINAME\fR ...]
Names of the instance groups to delete.

.SH "FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-zone\fR=\fIZONE\fR
Zone of the instance groups to delete. If not specified and the
\f5\fIcompute/zone\fR\fR property isn't set, you may be prompted to select a
zone.

To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
\f5\fIcompute/zone\fR\fR property:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE
.RE

A list of zones can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute zones list
.RE

To unset the property, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config unset compute/zone
.RE

Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
\f5\fICLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE\fR\fR.
