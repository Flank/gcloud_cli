.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(BETA)\fR \fBgcloud beta compute target\-http\-proxies update\fR is used to
change the URL map of existing target HTTP proxies. A target HTTP proxy is
referenced by one or more forwarding rules which specify the network traffic
that the proxy is responsible for routing. The target HTTP proxy points to a URL
map that defines the rules for routing the requests. The URL map's job is to map
URLs to backend services which handle the actual requests.
