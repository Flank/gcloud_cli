To create a metric that counts the number of log entries with a severity level
higher than WARNING, run:

user\-defined labels, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha logging metrics create my_metric \e
    \-\-config\-from\-file=$PATH_TO_FILE
.RE

The config file can be in YAML or JSON format. Detailed information about how to
