.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fBgcloud compute target\-https\-proxies create\fR is used to create target
HTTPS proxies. A target HTTPS proxy is referenced by one or more forwarding
rules which define which packets the proxy is responsible for routing. The
target HTTPS proxy points to a URL map that defines the rules for routing the
requests. The URL map's job is to map URLs to backend services which handle the
actual requests. The target HTTPS proxy also points to at most 10 SSL
certificates used for server\-side authentication.
