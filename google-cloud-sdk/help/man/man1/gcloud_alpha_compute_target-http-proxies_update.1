.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR \fBgcloud alpha compute target\-http\-proxies update\fR is used to
change the URL map of existing target HTTP proxies. A target HTTP proxy is
referenced by one or more forwarding rules which specify the network traffic
that the proxy is responsible for routing. The target HTTP proxy points to a URL
map that defines the rules for routing the requests. The URL map's job is to map
URLs to backend services which handle the actual requests.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fINAME\fR
Name of the target HTTP proxy to update.

.SH "REQUIRED FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-url\-map\fR=\fIURL_MAP\fR
A reference to a URL map resource. A URL map defines the mapping of URLs to
backend services. Before you can refer to a URL map, you must create the URL
map. To delete a URL map that a target proxy is referring to, you must first
delete the target HTTP proxy.

.SH "OPTIONAL FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m

At most one of these may be specified:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-global\fR
If set, the target HTTP proxy is global.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-region\fR=\fIREGION\fR
Region of the target HTTP proxy to update. If not specified, you may be prompted
to select a region.

To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
\f5\fIcompute/region\fR\fR property:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config set compute/region REGION
.RE

A list of regions can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute regions list
.RE

To unset the property, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config unset compute/region
.RE

Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
\f5\fICLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION\fR\fR.

\fB\-\-global\-url\-map\fR
If set, the URL map is global.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-url\-map\-region\fR=\fIURL_MAP_REGION\fR
Region of the URL map to operate on. Overrides the default \fBcompute/region\fR
property value for this command invocation.

.SH "EXAMPLES"

If there is an already\-created URL map with the name URL_MAP, update a global
target HTTP proxy pointing to this map by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha compute target\-http\-proxies update PROXY_NAME \e
    \-\-url\-map=URL_MAP
.RE

Update a regional target HTTP proxy by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha compute target\-http\-proxies update PROXY_NAME \e
    \-\-url\-map=URL_MAP \-\-region=REGION_NAME
.RE



.SH "NOTES"

This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right project,
you may be trying to access an API with an invitation\-only early access
allowlist. These variants are also available:
