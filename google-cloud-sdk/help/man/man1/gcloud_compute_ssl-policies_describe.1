.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fBgcloud compute ssl\-policies describe\fR is used to display all data
associated with a Compute Engine SSL policy in a project.

An SSL policy specifies the server\-side support for SSL features. An SSL policy
can be attached to a TargetHttpsProxy or a TargetSslProxy. This affects
connections between clients and the HTTPS or SSL proxy load balancer. SSL
policies do not affect the connection between the load balancers and the
backends.
