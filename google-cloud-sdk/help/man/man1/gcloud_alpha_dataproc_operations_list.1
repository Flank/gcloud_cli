\f5gcloud alpha dataproc operations list\fR [\fB\-\-cluster\fR=\fICLUSTER\fR] [\fB\-\-region\fR=\fIREGION\fR] [\fB\-\-state\-filter\fR=\fISTATE_FILTER\fR] [\fB\-\-filter\fR=\fIEXPRESSION\fR] [\fB\-\-limit\fR=\fILIMIT\fR] [\fB\-\-page\-size\fR=\fIPAGE_SIZE\fR;\ default=100] [\fB\-\-sort\-by\fR=[\fIFIELD\fR,...]] [\fIGCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG\ ...\fR]



.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR View a list of operations in a project. An optional filter can be
used to constrain the operations returned. Filters are case\-sensitive and have
the following syntax:

.RS 2m
field = value [AND [field = value]] ...
.RE

where \f5field\fR is either of \f5status.state\fR or \f5labels.[KEY]\fR, where
\f5[KEY]\fR is a label key. \f5value\fR can be \f5*\fR to match all values.
\f5status.state\fR is one of: \f5PENDING\fR, \f5ACTIVE\fR, \f5DONE\fR. Only the
logical \f5AND\fR operator is supported; space\-separated items are treated as
having an implicit \f5AND\fR operator.



.SH "FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-cluster\fR=\fICLUSTER\fR
Restrict to the operations of this Dataproc cluster. This flag is ignored when
\-\-filter is specified. The equivalent term in a \-\-filter expression is:
\f5clusterName = myclustername\fR

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-region\fR=\fIREGION\fR
Cloud Dataproc region to use. Each Cloud Dataproc region constitutes an
independent resource namespace constrained to deploying instances into Compute
Engine zones inside the region. Overrides the default \fBdataproc/region\fR
property value for this command invocation.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-state\-filter\fR=\fISTATE_FILTER\fR
Filter by cluster state. This flag is ignored when \-\-filter is specified. The
equivalent term in a \-\-filter expression is: \f5status.state = ACTIVE\fR.
\fISTATE_FILTER\fR must be one of: \fBactive\fR, \fBinactive\fR.

.SH "LIST COMMAND FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-filter\fR=\fIEXPRESSION\fR
Apply a Boolean filter \fIEXPRESSION\fR to each resource item to be listed. If
the expression evaluates \f5True\fR, then that item is listed. For more details
and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters. This flag
interacts with other flags that are applied in this order: \fB\-\-flatten\fR,
\fB\-\-sort\-by\fR, \fB\-\-filter\fR, \fB\-\-limit\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-limit\fR=\fILIMIT\fR
Maximum number of resources to list. The default is \fBunlimited\fR. This flag
interacts with other flags that are applied in this order: \fB\-\-flatten\fR,
\fB\-\-sort\-by\fR, \fB\-\-filter\fR, \fB\-\-limit\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-page\-size\fR=\fIPAGE_SIZE\fR; default=100
Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag specifies the
maximum number of resources per page. The default is \fB100\fR. Paging may be
applied before or after \fB\-\-filter\fR and \fB\-\-limit\fR depending on the
service.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-sort\-by\fR=[\fIFIELD\fR,...]
Comma\-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The default order
is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending order on that field. This
flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
\fB\-\-flatten\fR, \fB\-\-sort\-by\fR, \fB\-\-filter\fR, \fB\-\-limit\fR.

.SH "EXAMPLES"

To see the list of all operations in Dataproc's 'us\-central1' region, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha dataproc operations list \-\-region='us\-central1'
.RE

To see the list of all create cluster operations in Dataproc's 'global' region,
run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha dataproc operations list \-\-region='global' \e
    \-\-filter='operationType = CREATE'
.RE

To see the list of all active operations in a cluster named 'mycluster' located
in Dataproc's 'global' region, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha dataproc operations list \-\-region='global' \e
    \-\-filter='status.state = RUNNING AND
  clusterName = mycluster'
.RE

To see a list of all pending operations with the label \f5env=staging\fR on
cluster \f5mycluster\fR located in Dataproc's 'us\-central1' region, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha dataproc operations list \-\-region='us\-central1' \e

  AND labels.env = staging AND clusterName = mycluster'

.SH "NOTES"

This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right project,
you may be trying to access an API with an invitation\-only early access
allowlist. These variants are also available:
