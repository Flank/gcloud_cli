.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(BETA)\fR Get a transcript of an audio file that is less than 60 seconds. You
can use an audio file that is on your local drive or a Google Cloud Storage URL.

If the audio is longer than 60 seconds, you will get an error. Please use
\f5gcloud beta ml speech recognize\-long\-running\fR instead.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fIAUDIO\fR
The location of the audio file to transcribe. Must be a local path or a Google
Cloud Storage URL (in the format gs://bucket/object).

.sp

.SH "REQUIRED FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-language\-code\fR=\fILANGUAGE_CODE\fR
The language of the supplied audio as a BCP\-47
(https://www.rfc\-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt) language tag. Example: "en\-US".
See https://cloud.google.com/speech/docs/languages for a list of the currently
supported language codes.

.SH "OPTIONAL FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-additional\-language\-codes\fR=[\fILANGUAGE_CODE\fR,...]
The BCP\-47 language tags of other languages that the speech may be in. Up to 3
can be provided.

If alternative languages are listed, recognition result will contain recognition
in the most likely language detected including the main language\-code.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-encoding\fR=\fIENCODING\fR; default="encoding\-unspecified"
The type of encoding of the file. Required if the file format is not WAV or
FLAC. \fIENCODING\fR must be one of: \fBamr\fR, \fBamr\-wb\fR,
\fBencoding\-unspecified\fR, \fBflac\fR, \fBlinear16\fR, \fBmp3\fR, \fBmulaw\fR,
\fBogg\-opus\fR, \fBspeex\-with\-header\-byte\fR, \fBwebm\-opus\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-filter\-profanity\fR
If True, the server will attempt to filter out profanities, replacing all but
the initial character in each filtered word with asterisks, e.g. \e"f**\fB\e".

.TP 2m
\fR\-\-hints\fB=[\fIHINTS\fR,...]
A list of strings containing word and phrase "hints" so that the speech
recognition is more likely to recognize them. This can be used to improve the
accuracy for specific words and phrases, for example, if specific commands are
typically spoken by the user. This can also be used to add additional words to
the vocabulary of the recognizer. See
https://cloud.google.com/speech/limits#content.

.TP 2m
\fR\-\-include\-word\-confidence\fB
Include a list of words and the confidence for those words in the top result.

.TP 2m
\fR\-\-include\-word\-time\-offsets\fB
If True, the top result includes a list of words with the start and end time
offsets (timestamps) for those words. If False, no word\-level time offset
information is returned.

.TP 2m
\fR\-\-max\-alternatives\fB=\fIMAX_ALTERNATIVES\fR; default=1
Maximum number of recognition hypotheses to be returned. The server may return
fewer than max_alternatives. Valid values are 0\-30. A value of 0 or 1 will
return a maximum of one.

.TP 2m
\fR\-\-sample\-rate\fB=\fISAMPLE_RATE\fR
The sample rate in Hertz. For best results, set the sampling rate of the audio
source to 16000 Hz. If that's not possible, use the native sample rate of the
audio source (instead of re\-sampling).

.TP 2m
\fR\-\-enable\-speaker\-diarization\fB
Enable speaker detection for each recognized word in the top alternative of the
recognition result using an integer speaker_tag provided in the WordInfo.

.TP 2m
\fR\-\-diarization\-speaker\-count\fB=\fIDIARIZATION_SPEAKER_COUNT\fR
Estimated number of speakers in the conversation being recognized.
