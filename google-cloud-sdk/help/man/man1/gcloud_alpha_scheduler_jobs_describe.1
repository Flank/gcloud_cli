\fB\-\-view\fR=\fIVIEW\fR; default="basic"
The response_view specifies which subset of the Job will be returned. By default
ListJobsRequest.response_view is Job.View.BASIC; not all information is
retrieved by default because some data, such as payloads, might be desirable to
return only when needed because of its large size or because of the sensitivity
of data that it contains. \fIVIEW\fR must be one of: \fBbasic\fR, \fBfull\fR.
