\f5gcloud alpha auth login\fR [\fIACCOUNT\fR] [\fB\-\-no\-activate\fR] [\fB\-\-brief\fR] [\fB\-\-enable\-gdrive\-access\fR] [\fB\-\-force\fR] [\fB\-\-no\-launch\-browser\fR] [\fB\-\-update\-adc\fR] [\fIGCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG\ ...\fR]



.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR Obtains access credentials for your user account via a web\-based
authorization flow. When this command completes successfully, it sets the active
account in the current configuration to the account specified. If no
configuration exists, it creates a configuration named default.

If valid credentials for an account are already available from a prior
authorization, the account is set to active without rerunning the flow.

Use \f5gcloud auth list\fR to view credentialed accounts.

If you'd rather authorize without a web browser but still interact with the
command line, use the \f5\-\-no\-launch\-browser\fR flag. To authorize without a
web browser and non\-interactively, create a service account with the
appropriate scopes using the Google Cloud Platform Console
(https://console.cloud.google.com) and use \f5gcloud auth
activate\-service\-account\fR with the corresponding JSON key file.

For more information on authorization and credential types, see:
https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/authorizing.
