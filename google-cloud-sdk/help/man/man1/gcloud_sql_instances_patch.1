specified, Cloud SQL chooses the timing of updates to your instance.
\fIMAINTENANCE_RELEASE_CHANNEL\fR must be one of:

.RE
.sp

permanent for the life of the instance. With this setting enabled, a spike in
storage requirements can result in permanently increased storage costs for your
instance. However, if an instance runs out of available space, it can result in
the instance going offline, dropping existing connections. This setting is
