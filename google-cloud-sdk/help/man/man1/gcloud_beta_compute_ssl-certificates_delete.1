.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(BETA)\fR \fBgcloud beta compute ssl\-certificates delete\fR deletes one or
more Compute Engine SSL certificates. SSL certificates can only be deleted when

At most one of these may be specified:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-global\fR
If set, the SSL certificates are global.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-region\fR=\fIREGION\fR
Region of the SSL certificates to delete. If not specified, you may be prompted
to select a region.

To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
\f5\fIcompute/region\fR\fR property:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config set compute/region REGION
.RE

A list of regions can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute regions list
.RE

To unset the property, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config unset compute/region
.RE

Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
\f5\fICLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION\fR\fR.
