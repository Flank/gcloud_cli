\f5gcloud alpha dataproc clusters list\fR [\fB\-\-region\fR=\fIREGION\fR] [\fB\-\-filter\fR=\fIEXPRESSION\fR] [\fB\-\-limit\fR=\fILIMIT\fR] [\fB\-\-page\-size\fR=\fIPAGE_SIZE\fR;\ default=100] [\fB\-\-sort\-by\fR=[\fIFIELD\fR,...]] [\fIGCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG\ ...\fR]



.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR View a list of clusters in a project. An optional filter can be
used to constrain the clusters returned. Filters are case\-sensitive and have
the following syntax:

.RS 2m
field = value [AND [field = value]] ...
.RE

where \f5field\fR is one of \f5status.state\fR, \f5clusterName\fR, or
\f5labels.[KEY]\fR, and \f5[KEY]\fR is a label key. \f5value\fR can be \f5*\fR
to match all values. \f5status.state\fR can be one of the following:
\f5ACTIVE\fR, \f5INACTIVE\fR, \f5CREATING\fR, \f5RUNNING\fR, \f5ERROR\fR,
\f5DELETING\fR, or \f5UPDATING\fR. \f5ACTIVE\fR contains the \f5CREATING\fR,
\f5UPDATING\fR, and \f5RUNNING\fR states. \f5INACTIVE\fR contains the
\f5DELETING\fR and \f5ERROR\fR states. \f5clusterName\fR is the name of the
cluster provided at creation time. Only the logical \f5AND\fR operator is
supported; space\-separated items are treated as having an implicit \f5AND\fR
operator.



.SH "FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-region\fR=\fIREGION\fR
Cloud Dataproc region to use. Each Cloud Dataproc region constitutes an
independent resource namespace constrained to deploying instances into Compute
Engine zones inside the region. Overrides the default \fBdataproc/region\fR
property value for this command invocation.

.SH "LIST COMMAND FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-filter\fR=\fIEXPRESSION\fR
Apply a Boolean filter \fIEXPRESSION\fR to each resource item to be listed. If
the expression evaluates \f5True\fR, then that item is listed. For more details
and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters. This flag
interacts with other flags that are applied in this order: \fB\-\-flatten\fR,
\fB\-\-sort\-by\fR, \fB\-\-filter\fR, \fB\-\-limit\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-limit\fR=\fILIMIT\fR
Maximum number of resources to list. The default is \fBunlimited\fR. This flag
interacts with other flags that are applied in this order: \fB\-\-flatten\fR,
\fB\-\-sort\-by\fR, \fB\-\-filter\fR, \fB\-\-limit\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-page\-size\fR=\fIPAGE_SIZE\fR; default=100
Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag specifies the
maximum number of resources per page. The default is \fB100\fR. Paging may be
applied before or after \fB\-\-filter\fR and \fB\-\-limit\fR depending on the
service.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-sort\-by\fR=[\fIFIELD\fR,...]
Comma\-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The default order
is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending order on that field. This
flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
\fB\-\-flatten\fR, \fB\-\-sort\-by\fR, \fB\-\-filter\fR, \fB\-\-limit\fR.

.SH "EXAMPLES"

To see the list of all clusters in Dataproc's 'us\-central1' region, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha dataproc clusters list \-\-region='us\-central1'
.RE

To show a cluster in Dataproc's 'global' region with the name 'mycluster', run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha dataproc clusters list \-\-region='global' \e
    \-\-filter='clusterName = mycluster'
.RE

To see the list of all clusters in Dataproc's 'global' region with specified
labels, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha dataproc clusters list \-\-region='global' \e
    \-\-filter='labels.env = staging AND
  labels.starred = *'
.RE

To see a list of all active clusters in Dataproc's 'europe\-west1' region with
specified labels, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha dataproc clusters list \-\-region='europe\-west1' \e
    \-\-filter='status.state = ACTIVE AND
  labels.env = staging AND labels.starred = *'

.SH "NOTES"

This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right project,
you may be trying to access an API with an invitation\-only early access
allowlist. These variants are also available:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud dataproc clusters list
$ gcloud beta dataproc clusters list
