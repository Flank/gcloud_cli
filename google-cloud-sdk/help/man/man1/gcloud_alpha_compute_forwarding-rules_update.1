.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR \fBgcloud alpha compute forwarding\-rules update\fR updates labels
and network tier for a Google Compute Engine forwarding rule.

Example to update labels:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha compute forwarding\-rules update example\-fr \e
    \-\-region us\-central1 \e
  \-\-update\-labels=k0=value1,k1=value2 \-\-remove\-labels=k3
.RE

will add/update labels \f5\fIk0\fR\fR and \f5\fIk1\fR\fR and remove labels with
key \f5\fIk3\fR\fR.

Labels can be used to identify the forwarding rule and to filter them as in

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha compute forwarding\-rules list \e
    \-\-filter='labels.k1:value2'
.RE

To list existing labels

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha compute forwarding\-rules describe example\-fr \e
    \-\-format='default(labels)'
.RE



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m

\fINAME\fR
The name of the forwarding rule to operate on.

.SH "FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-network\-tier\fR=\fINETWORK_TIER\fR
Update the network tier of a forwarding rule. It does not allow to change from
\f5PREMIUM\fR to \f5STANDARD\fR and visa versa.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-update\-labels\fR=[\fIKEY\fR=\fIVALUE\fR,...]
A list of label KEY=VALUE pairs to update. If a label exists its value is
modified, otherwise a new label is created.

.TP 2m

At most one of these may be specified:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-clear\-labels\fR
Removes all labels. If \f5\-\-update\-labels\fR is also specified then
\f5\-\-clear\-labels\fR is applied first.

For example, to remove all labels:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha compute forwarding\-rules update \-\-clear\-labels
.RE

To set the labels to exactly "foo" and "baz":

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha compute forwarding\-rules update \-\-clear\-labels \e
  \-\-update\-labels foo=bar,baz=qux
.RE

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-remove\-labels\fR=[\fIKEY\fR,...]
A list of label keys to remove. If a label does not exist it is silently
ignored.

.RE
.sp
.TP 2m

At most one of these may be specified:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-global\fR
If provided, it is assumed the forwarding rule is global.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-region\fR=\fIREGION\fR
The region of the forwarding rule to operate on. If not specified, you will be
prompted to select a region.

To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
\f5\fIcompute/region\fR\fR property:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config set compute/region REGION
.RE

A list of regions can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute regions list
.RE

To unset the property, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config unset compute/region
.RE

Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
\f5\fICLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION\fR\fR.
