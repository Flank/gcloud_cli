.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR Update a Dialogflow entity type.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m

EntityType resource \- Entity type to update. This represents a Cloud resource.
(NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in
other ways. To set the [project] attribute: provide the argument [entity_type]
on the command line with a fully specified name; set the property
[core/project]; provide the argument [\-\-project] on the command line. This
must be specified.

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fIENTITY_TYPE\fR

.SH "FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-auto\-expand\fR
Whether or not the entity type can be automatically expanded to idenitify
entities not explicitly included.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-display\-name\fR=\fIDISPLAY_NAME\fR
A human readable name for the entity type.

.TP 2m

Use these flags for adding and removing entities:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-add\-entities\fR=\fIADD_ENTITIES\fR
Comma separated list of entities, or a map of entities to synonyms, to be added
to existing list of entities.

If specified with \f5\-\-remove\-entities\fR or \f5\-\-clear\-entities\fR,
entities will be removed in a separate request before entities are added. If an
entity with a given value exists, it will be overwritten.

If a list, the entities can contain references to other entity types (with or
without aliases).

To specify a map, set this flag with \f5\-\-flags\-file\fR as a map, where each
key is the canonical name and each value is a list of synonyms to map to the
canonical name. The canonical name must be explicitly included in the list of
synonyms. For more information on \f5\-\-flags\-file\fR, see \f5gcloud topics
flags\-file\fR.

For example, use \f5\-\-flags\-file=flags.yaml\fR, where \f5flags.yaml\fR
contains:

.RS 2m
\-\-entities:
  red:
  \- red
  \- cherry
  \- rose
  blue:
  \- blue
  \- azure
  \- cyan
.RE

.TP 2m

At most one of these may be specified:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-clear\-entities\fR
If true, remove all existing entities.

Can be used with \f5\-\-add\-entities\fR to replace existing entities.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-remove\-entities\fR=[\fIREMOVE_ENTITIES\fR,...]
A comma separated list of entities to be removed.
