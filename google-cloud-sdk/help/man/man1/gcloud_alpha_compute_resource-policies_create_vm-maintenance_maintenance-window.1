.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR Create a Compute Engine VM Maintenance Resource Policy that
contains time window in which maintenance should start.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fINAME\fR
Name of the resource policy to operate on.


.RE
.sp

.SH "REQUIRED FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m

Cycle Frequency Group. This must be specified.

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-daily\-window\fR
Maintenance activity window starts daily at START_TIME. This flag must be
specified if any of the other arguments in this group are specified.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-start\-time\fR=\fISTART_TIME\fR
Start time of a four\-hour window in which maintenance should start in daily
cadence. Valid choices are 00:00, 04:00, 08:00, 12:00, 16:00 and 20:00 UTC. For
example, \f5\-\-start\-time="08:00"\fR. This flag must be specified if any of
the other arguments in this group are specified.

.SH "OPTIONAL FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-description\fR=\fIDESCRIPTION\fR
An optional, textual description for the backend.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-region\fR=\fIREGION\fR
Region of the resource policy to operate on. If not specified, you may be
prompted to select a region.

To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
\f5\fIcompute/region\fR\fR property:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config set compute/region REGION
.RE

A list of regions can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute regions list
.RE

To unset the property, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config unset compute/region
.RE

Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
\f5\fICLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION\fR\fR.
