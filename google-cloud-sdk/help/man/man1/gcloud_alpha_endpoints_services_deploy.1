.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR This command is used to deploy a service configuration for a
service to Google Service Management. As input, it takes one or more paths to
service configurations that should be uploaded. These configuration files can be
Proto Descriptors, Open API (Swagger) specifications, or Google Service
Configuration files in JSON or YAML formats.

If a service name is present in multiple configuration files (given in the
\f5host\fR field in OpenAPI specifications or the \f5name\fR field in Google
Service Configuration files), the first one will take precedence.

When deploying a new service configuration to an already\-existing service, some
safety checks will be made comparing the new configuration to the active
configuration. If any actionable advice is provided, it will be printed out to
the log, and the deployment will be halted. It is recommended that these
warnings be addressed before proceeding, but they can be overridden with the
\-\-force flag.

This command will block until deployment is complete unless the \f5\-\-async\fR
flag is passed.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-async\fR
Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to complete.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-force\fR, \fB\-f\fR
Force the deployment even if any hazardous changes to the service configuration
are detected.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-validate\-only\fR
If included, the command validates the service configuration(s), but does not
deploy them. The service must exist in order to validate the configuration(s).
