specified:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-instance\-filter\fR=\fIINSTANCE_FILTER\fR
(DEPRECATED) Filter expression for selecting the instances to patch. Patching
supports the same filter mechanisms as \f5gcloud compute instances list\fR,
allowing one to patch specific instances by name, zone, label, or other
criteria.

.RS 2m
\-\-instance\-filter is deprecated; use individual filter flags instead. See
the command help text for more details.
.RE

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-instance\-filter\-all\fR
A filter that targets all instances in the project.

.TP 2m

Individual filters. The targeted instances must meet all criteria specified.


.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-instance\-filter\-group\-labels\fR=[\fIKEY\fR=\fIVALUE\fR,...]
A filter that represents a label set. Targeted instances must have all specified
labels in this set. For example, "env=prod and app=web".

This flag can be repeated. Targeted instances must have at least one of these
label sets. This allows targeting of disparate groups, for example, "(env=prod
and app=web) or (env=staging and app=web)".

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-instance\-filter\-name\-prefixes\fR=[\fIINSTANCE_FILTER_NAME_PREFIXES\fR,...]
A filter that targets instances whose name starts with one of these prefixes.
For example, "prod\-".

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-instance\-filter\-names\fR=[\fIINSTANCE_FILTER_NAMES\fR,...]
A filter that targets instances of any of the specified names. Instances are
specified by the URI in the form "zones/<ZONE>/instances/<INSTANCE_NAME>",
"projects/<PROJECT_ID>/zones/<ZONE>/instances/<INSTANCE_NAME>", or
"https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/<PROJECT_ID>/zones/<ZONE>/instances/<INSTANCE_NAME>".

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-instance\-filter\-zones\fR=[\fIINSTANCE_FILTER_ZONES\fR,...]
A filter that targets instances in any of the specified zones. Leave empty to
target instances in any zone.

instances are contacted, but the patch is not run.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-duration\fR=\fIDURATION\fR
Total duration in which the patch job must complete. If the patch does not
complete in this time, the process times out. While some instances might still
be running the patch, they will not continue to work after completing the

absolute time durations.

If unspecified, the job stays active until all instances complete the patch.

\fBnever\fR
Never reboot the machine after the update completes.

within a region) have the same number of targeted VMs, a tie\-breaker is
achieved by sorting the regions or zones in alphabetical order.
