Attaches accelerators (e.g. GPUs) to the instances.

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fBtype\fR
The specific type (e.g. nvidia\-tesla\-k80 for nVidia Tesla K80) of accelerator
to attach to the instances. Use 'gcloud compute accelerator\-types list' to
learn about all available accelerator types.

.TP 2m
\fBcount\fR
Number of accelerators to attach to each instance. The default value is 1.

.RE
.sp
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-boot\-disk\-auto\-delete\fR
Automatically delete boot disks when their instances are deleted. Enabled by
default, use \fB\-\-no\-boot\-disk\-auto\-delete\fR to disable.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-boot\-disk\-device\-name\fR=\fIBOOT_DISK_DEVICE_NAME\fR
The name the guest operating system will see for the boot disk. This option can
only be specified if a new boot disk is being created (as opposed to mounting an
existing persistent disk).

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-boot\-disk\-size\fR=\fIBOOT_DISK_SIZE\fR
The size of the boot disk. This option can only be specified if a new boot disk
is being created (as opposed to mounting an existing persistent disk). The value
must be a whole number followed by a size unit of \f5\fIKB\fR\fR for kilobyte,
\f5\fIMB\fR\fR for megabyte, \f5\fIGB\fR\fR for gigabyte, or \f5\fITB\fR\fR for
terabyte. For example, \f5\fI10GB\fR\fR will produce a 10 gigabyte disk. The
minimum size a boot disk can have is 10 GB. Disk size must be a multiple of 1
GB. Limit boot disk size to 2 TB to account for MBR partition table limitations.
Default size unit is \f5\fIGB\fR\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-boot\-disk\-type\fR=\fIBOOT_DISK_TYPE\fR
The type of the boot disk. This option can only be specified if a new boot disk
is being created (as opposed to mounting an existing persistent disk). To get a
list of available disk types, run \f5$ gcloud compute disk\-types list\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-can\-ip\-forward\fR
If provided, allows the instances to send and receive packets with non\-matching
destination or source IP addresses.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-confidential\-compute\fR
The instance will boot with confidential compute enabled. Confidential Compute
is based on Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV), an AMD virtualization feature
for running confidential instances.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-configure\-disk\fR=[\fIPROPERTY\fR=\fIVALUE\fR,...]
This option has effect only when used with \f5\-\-source\-instance\fR. It allows
you to override how the source\-instance's disks are defined in the template.

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fBauto\-delete\fR
If \f5true\fR, this persistent disk will be automatically deleted when the
instance is deleted. However, if the disk is later detached from the instance,
this option won't apply. If not provided, the setting is copied from the source
instance. Allowed values of the flag are: \f5false\fR, \f5no\fR, \f5true\fR, and
\f5yes\fR.

.TP 2m
\fBdevice\-name\fR
Name of the device.

.TP 2m
\fBinstantiate\-from\fR
Specifies whether to include the disk and which image to use. Valid values are:
attach\-read\-only, blank, custom\-image, do\-not\-include, source\-image,
source\-image\-family

.TP 2m
\fBcustom\-image\fR
The custom image to use if custom\-image is specified for instantiate\-from.

.RE
.sp
.TP 2m

instance is being created.

.TP 2m
\fBdescription\fR
Optional textual description for the disk being created.

.TP 2m
\fBmode\fR
Specifies the mode of the disk. Supported options are \f5\fIro\fR\fR for
read\-only and \f5\fIrw\fR\fR for read\-write. If omitted, \f5\fIrw\fR\fR is
used as a default.

.TP 2m
\fBimage\fR
Specifies the name of the image that the disk will be initialized with. A new
disk will be created based on the given image. To view a list of public images
and projects, run \f5$ gcloud compute images list\fR. It is best practice to use
image when a specific version of an image is needed. If both image and
image\-family flags are omitted a blank disk will be created.

.TP 2m
\fBimage\-family\fR
The image family for the operating system that the boot disk will be initialized
with. Compute Engine offers multiple Linux distributions, some of which are
available as both regular and Shielded VM images. When a family is specified
instead of an image, the latest non\-deprecated image associated with that
family is used. It is best practice to use \-\-image\-family when the latest
version of an image is needed.

.TP 2m
\fBimage\-project\fR
The Google Cloud project against which all image and image family references
will be resolved. It is best practice to define image\-project. A full list of
available projects can be generated by running \f5gcloud projects list\fR.

.RS 2m
.IP "\(bu" 2m
If specifying one of our public images, image\-project must be provided.
.IP "\(bu" 2m
If there are several of the same image\-family value in multiple projects,
image\-project must be specified to clarify the image to be used.
.IP "\(bu" 2m
If not specified and either image or image\-family is provided, the current
default project is used.

.RE
.sp
.TP 2m
\fBsize\fR
The size of the disk. The value must be a whole number followed by a size unit
of \f5\fIKB\fR\fR for kilobyte, \f5\fIMB\fR\fR for megabyte, \f5\fIGB\fR\fR for
gigabyte, or \f5\fITB\fR\fR for terabyte. For example, \f5\fI10GB\fR\fR will
produce a 10 gigabyte disk. Disk size must be a multiple of 1 GB. If not
specified, the default image size will be used for the new disk.

.TP 2m
\fBtype\fR
The type of the disk. To get a list of available disk types, run $ gcloud
compute disk\-types list. The default disk type is \f5\fIpd\-standard\fR\fR.

.TP 2m

see. If omitted, a device name of the form \f5persistent\-disk\-N\fR will be
used.

.TP 2m
\fBauto\-delete\fR
If \f5\fIyes\fR\fR, this persistent disk will be automatically deleted when the
instance is deleted. However, if the disk is later detached from the instance,
this option won't apply. The default value for this is \f5\fIyes\fR\fR.

.TP 2m
\fBboot\fR
If \f5\fIyes\fR\fR, indicates that this is a boot disk. The instance will use
the first partition of the disk for its root file system. The default value for
this is \f5\fIno\fR\fR.

.TP 2m
\fBkms\-key\fR
Fully qualified Cloud KMS cryptokey name that will protect the disk.

This can either be the fully qualified path or the name.

The fully qualified Cloud KMS cryptokey name format is:
\f5\fIprojects/<kms\-project>/locations/<kms\-location>/keyRings/<kms\-keyring>/
cryptoKeys/<key\-name>\fR\fR.

If the value is not fully qualified then kms\-location, kms\-keyring, and
optionally kms\-project are required.

See https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer\-managed\-encryption
for more details.

.TP 2m
\fBkms\-project\fR
Project that contains the Cloud KMS cryptokey that will protect the disk.

If the project is not specified then the project where the disk is being created
will be used.

If this flag is set then key\-location, kms\-keyring, and kms\-key are required.

See https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer\-managed\-encryption
for more details.

.TP 2m
\fBkms\-location\fR
Location of the Cloud KMS cryptokey to be used for protecting the disk.

All Cloud KMS cryptokeys are reside in a 'location'. To get a list of possible
locations run 'gcloud kms locations list'. If this flag is set then kms\-keyring
and kms\-key are required. See
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer\-managed\-encryption for
more details.

.TP 2m
\fBkms\-keyring\fR
The keyring which contains the Cloud KMS cryptokey that will protect the disk.

If this flag is set then kms\-location and kms\-key are required.

See https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer\-managed\-encryption

\fBmulti\-writer\fR
If \f5\fIyes\fR\fR, create the disk in multi\-writer mode so that it can be
attached with read\-write access to multiple VMs. Can only be used with zonal
SSD persistent disks. Disks in multi\-writer mode do not support resize and
snapshot operations. The default value is \f5\fIno\fR\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-description\fR=\fIDESCRIPTION\fR
Specifies a textual description for the instance template.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-disk\fR=[\fIauto\-delete\fR=\fIAUTO\-DELETE\fR],[\fIboot\fR=\fIBOOT\fR],[\fIdevice\-name\fR=\fIDEVICE\-NAME\fR],[\fImode\fR=\fIMODE\fR],[\fIname\fR=\fINAME\fR]
Attaches persistent disks to the instances. The disks specified must already
exist.

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fBname\fR
The disk to attach to the instances. When creating more than one instance and
using this property, the only valid mode for attaching the disk is read\-only
(see \fBmode\fR below).

.TP 2m
\fBmode\fR
Specifies the mode of the disk. Supported options are \f5\fIro\fR\fR for
read\-only and \f5\fIrw\fR\fR for read\-write. If omitted, \f5\fIrw\fR\fR is
used as a default. It is an error for mode to be \f5\fIrw\fR\fR when creating
more than one instance because read\-write disks can only be attached to a
single instance.

.TP 2m
\fBboot\fR
If \f5\fIyes\fR\fR, indicates that this is a boot disk. The virtual machines
will use the first partition of the disk for their root file systems. The
default value for this is \f5\fIno\fR\fR.

.TP 2m
\fBdevice\-name\fR
An optional name that indicates the disk name the guest operating system will
see. If omitted, a device name of the form \f5persistent\-disk\-N\fR will be
used.

.TP 2m
\fBauto\-delete\fR
If \f5\fIyes\fR\fR, this persistent disk will be automatically deleted when the
instance is deleted. However, if the disk is later detached from the instance,
this option won't apply. The default value for this is \f5\fIyes\fR\fR.

Attaches a local SSD to the instances.

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fBdevice\-name\fR
Optional. A name that indicates the disk name the guest operating system will
see. Can only be specified if \f5interface\fR is \f5SCSI\fR. If omitted, a
device name of the form \f5\fIlocal\-ssd\-N\fR\fR will be used.

.TP 2m
\fBinterface\fR
Optional. The kind of disk interface exposed to the VM for this SSD. Valid
values are \f5\fISCSI\fR\fR and \f5\fINVME\fR\fR. SCSI is the default and is
supported by more guest operating systems. NVME may provide higher performance.

.RE
.sp
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-machine\-type\fR=\fIMACHINE_TYPE\fR
Specifies the machine type used for the instances. To get a list of available

for all metadata entries is 512 KB.

In images that have Compute Engine tools installed on them, such as the official
images (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images), the following metadata
keys have special meanings:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fBstartup\-script\fR
Specifies a script that will be executed by the instances once they start
running. For convenience, \f5\fI\-\-metadata\-from\-file\fR\fR can be used to
pull the value from a file.

an empty string will assign an ephemeral IP. Mutually exclusive with
no\-address. If neither key is present the instance will get an ephemeral IP.

.TP 2m
\fBnetwork\fR
Specifies the network that the interface will be part of. If subnet is also
specified it must be subnetwork of this network. If neither is specified, this
defaults to the "default" network.

.TP 2m
\fBno\-address\fR
If specified the interface will have no external IP. Mutually exclusive with
address. If neither key is present the instance will get an ephemeral IP.

.TP 2m
\fBnetwork\-tier\fR

select a region.

To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
\f5\fIcompute/region\fR\fR property:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config set compute/region REGION
.RE

A list of regions can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute regions list
.RE

To unset the property, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config unset compute/region
.RE

Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
\f5\fICLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION\fR\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-restart\-on\-failure\fR
The instances will be restarted if they are terminated by Compute Engine. This
does not affect terminations performed by the user. Enabled by default, use
\fB\-\-no\-restart\-on\-failure\fR to disable.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-shielded\-integrity\-monitoring\fR
Enables monitoring and attestation of the boot integrity of the instance. The
attestation is performed against the integrity policy baseline. This baseline is
initially derived from the implicitly trusted boot image when the instance is
created. This baseline can be updated by using
\f5\-\-shielded\-vm\-learn\-integrity\-policy\fR. On Shielded VMs, integrity
monitoring is enabled by default. For information about how to modify Shielded
VM options, see
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/modifying\-shielded\-vm.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-shielded\-secure\-boot\fR
