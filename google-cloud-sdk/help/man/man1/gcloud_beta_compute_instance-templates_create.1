.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(BETA)\fR \fBgcloud beta compute instance\-templates create\fR facilitates
the creation of Google Compute Engine virtual machine instance templates. For
example, running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud beta compute instance\-templates create INSTANCE\-TEMPLATE
.RE

value is 1.

.RE
.sp
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-boot\-disk\-auto\-delete\fR
Automatically delete boot disks when their instances are deleted. Enabled by
default, use \fB\-\-no\-boot\-disk\-auto\-delete\fR to disable.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-boot\-disk\-device\-name\fR=\fIBOOT_DISK_DEVICE_NAME\fR
The name the guest operating system will see for the boot disk. This option can
only be specified if a new boot disk is being created (as opposed to mounting an
existing persistent disk).

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-boot\-disk\-size\fR=\fIBOOT_DISK_SIZE\fR
The size of the boot disk. This option can only be specified if a new boot disk
is being created (as opposed to mounting an existing persistent disk). The value
must be a whole number followed by a size unit of \f5\fIKB\fR\fR for kilobyte,
\f5\fIMB\fR\fR for megabyte, \f5\fIGB\fR\fR for gigabyte, or \f5\fITB\fR\fR for
terabyte. For example, \f5\fI10GB\fR\fR will produce a 10 gigabyte disk. The
minimum size a boot disk can have is 10 GB. Disk size must be a multiple of 1
GB. Limit your boot disk size to 2TB to account for MBR partition table
limitations.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-boot\-disk\-type\fR=\fIBOOT_DISK_TYPE\fR
The type of the boot disk. This option can only be specified if a new boot disk
is being created (as opposed to mounting an existing persistent disk). To get a
list of available disk types, run \f5$ gcloud compute disk\-types list\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-can\-ip\-forward\fR
If provided, allows the instances to send and receive packets with non\-matching
destination or source IP addresses.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-configure\-disk\fR=[\fIPROPERTY\fR=\fIVALUE\fR,...]
This option has effect only when used with \f5\-\-source\-instance\fR. It allows
you to override how the source\-instance's disks are defined in the template.

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fBauto\-delete\fR
If \f5true\fR, this persistent disk will be automatically deleted when the
instance is deleted. However, if the disk is later detached from the instance,
this option won't apply. If not provided, the setting is copied from the source
instance. Allowed values of the flag are: \f5false\fR, \f5no\fR, \f5true\fR, and
\f5yes\fR.

used as a default.

.TP 2m
\fBimage\fR
Specifies the name of the image that the disk will be initialized with. A new
disk will be created based on the given image. To view a list of public images
and projects, run \f5$ gcloud compute images list\fR. It is best practice to use
image when a specific version of an image is needed. If both image and
image\-family flags are omitted a blank disk will be created.

.TP 2m
\fBimage\-family\fR
The family of the image that the disk will be initialized with. When a family is
specified instead of an image, the latest non\-deprecated image associated with
that family is used. It is best practice to use image\-family when the latest
version of an image is needed.

.TP 2m
\fBimage\-project\fR
The project that the image or image family belongs to. It is best practice to
define image\-project.
.RS 2m

compute disk\-types list. The default disk type is \f5\fIpd\-standard\fR\fR.

.TP 2m
\fBdevice\-name\fR
An optional name that indicates the disk name the guest operating system will
see. If omitted, a device name of the form \f5persistent\-disk\-N\fR will be
used.

.TP 2m
\fBauto\-delete\fR
If \f5\fIyes\fR\fR, this persistent disk will be automatically deleted when the
instance is deleted. However, if the disk is later detached from the instance,
this option won't apply. The default value for this is \f5\fIno\fR\fR.

.TP 2m
\fBkms\-key\fR
Fully qualified Cloud KMS cryptokey name that will protect the disk. This can
either be the fully qualified path or the name. The fully qualified Cloud KMS
cryptokey name format is:
\f5\fIprojects/<kms\-project>/locations/<kms\-location>/keyRings/<kms\-keyring>/
cryptoKeys/<key\-name>\fR\fR. If the value is not fully qualified then

https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer\-managed\-encryption for
more details.

.TP 2m
\fBkms\-project\fR
Project that contains the Cloud KMS cryptokey that will protect the disk. If the
project is not specified then the project where the disk is being created will
be used. If this flag is set then key\-location, kms\-keyring, and kms\-key are
required. See
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer\-managed\-encryption for
more details.

.TP 2m
\fBkms\-location\fR
Location of the Cloud KMS cryptokey to be used for protecting the disk. All
Cloud KMS cryptokeys are reside in a 'location'. To get a list of possible
locations run 'gcloud kms locations list'. If this flag is set then kms\-keyring
and kms\-key are required. See
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer\-managed\-encryption for
more details.

.TP 2m
\fBkms\-keyring\fR
The keyring which contains the Cloud KMS cryptokey that will protect the disk.
If this flag is set then kms\-location and kms\-key are required. See
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer\-managed\-encryption for
more details.

.TP 2m
\fBmode\fR
Specifies the mode of the disk. Supported options are \f5\fIro\fR\fR for
read\-only and \f5\fIrw\fR\fR for read\-write. If omitted, \f5\fIrw\fR\fR is
used as a default. It is an error for mode to be \f5\fIrw\fR\fR when creating
more than one instance because read\-write disks can only be attached to a
single instance.

.TP 2m
\fBboot\fR
If \f5\fIyes\fR\fR, indicates that this is a boot disk. The virtual machines
will use the first partition of the disk for their root file systems. The

\f5\fI\-\-boot\-disk\-size\fR\fR can be used to override the boot disk's device
name and size, respectively.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-image\-family\fR=\fIIMAGE_FAMILY\fR
The family of the image that the boot disk will be initialized with. When a
family is specified instead of an image, the latest non\-deprecated image
associated with that family is used. It is best practice to use
\f5\-\-image\-family\fR when the latest version of an image is needed.

By default, \f5\fIdebian\-9\fR\fR is assumed for this flag.

The JSON/YAML file containing the configuration of desired nodes onto which this
instance could be scheduled. These rules filter the nodes according to their
node affinity labels. A node's affinity labels come from the node template of
the group the node is in.

The file should contain a list of a JSON/YAML objects with the following fields:

.TP 2m
\fBkey\fR
Corresponds to the node affinity label keys of the Node resource.
