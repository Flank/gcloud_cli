.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR \fBgcloud alpha compute instance\-groups managed
update\-autoscaling\fR updates autoscaling parameters of specified managed
instance group.

Autoscalers can use one or more policies listed below. Information on using
multiple policies can be found here:
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/autoscaler/multiple\-policies

In contrast to \fBgcloud alpha compute instance\-groups managed
set\-autoscaling\fR, this command \fBonly\fR updates specified fields. For
instance:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha compute instance\-groups managed update\-autoscaling \e
  \-\-mode only\-scale\-out
.RE

would change the \fBmode\fR field of the autoscaler policy, but leave the rest
of the settings intact.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fINAME\fR
Name of the managed instance group to operate on.


.RE
.sp

.SH "FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-cpu\-utilization\-predictive\-method\fR=\fICPU_UTILIZATION_PREDICTIVE_METHOD\fR
Indicates which method of prediction is used for CPU utilization metric, if any.
\fICPU_UTILIZATION_PREDICTIVE_METHOD\fR must be one of:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fBnone\fR
(Default) No predictions are made based on the scaling metric when calculating
the number of VM instances.
.TP 2m
\fBoptimize\-availability\fR
Predictive autoscaling predicts the future values of the scaling metric and
scales a MIG in advance to ensure that new VM instances are ready in time to
cover the predicted peak.
.TP 2m
\fBstandard\fR
Standard predictive autoscaling predicts the future values of the scaling metric
and then scales a MIG to ensure that new VM instances are ready in time to cover
the predicted peak.
.RE
.sp


.TP 2m
\fB\-\-mode\fR=\fIMODE\fR
Set the mode of an autoscaler for a managed instance group.

You can turn off or restrict MIG autoscaler activities without affecting your
autoscaler configuration. The autoscaler configuration persists while the
activities are turned off or restricted, and the activities resume when the
autoscaler is turned on again or when the restrictions are lifted.

\fIMODE\fR must be one of:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fBoff\fR
Turns off autoscaling, while keeping the new configuration.
.TP 2m
\fBon\fR
Permits autoscaling to scale out and in (default for new autoscalers).
.TP 2m
\fBonly\-scale\-out\fR
Permits autoscaling to scale only out and not in.
.TP 2m
\fBonly\-up\fR
(DEPRECATED) Permits autoscaling to scale only out and not in.

.RS 2m
Value `only\-up` is deprecated. Use `\-\-mode only\-scale\-out`
instead.

.TP 2m

At most one of these may be specified:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-clear\-scale\-in\-control\fR
If specified, the scale\-in\-control field will be cleared. Using this flag will
remove any configuration set by \f5\-\-scale\-in\-control\fR flag.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-scale\-in\-control\fR=[\fImax\-scaled\-in\-replicas\fR=\fIMAX\-SCALED\-IN\-REPLICAS\fR],[\fImax\-scaled\-in\-replicas\-percent\fR=\fIMAX\-SCALED\-IN\-REPLICAS\-PERCENT\fR],[\fItime\-window\fR=\fITIME\-WINDOW\fR]
Configuration that allows slower scale in so that even if Autoscaler recommends
an abrupt scale in of a managed instance group, it will be throttled as
specified by the parameters.

.TP 2m
\fBmax\-scaled\-in\-replicas\fR
Maximum allowed number of VMs that can be deducted from the peak recommendation
during the window. Possibly all these VMs can be deleted at once so the
application needs to be prepared to lose that many VMs in one step. Mutually
exclusive with 'max\-scaled\-in\-replicas\-percent'.

.TP 2m
\fBmax\-scaled\-in\-replicas\-percent\fR
Maximum allowed percent of VMs that can be deducted from the peak recommendation
during the window. Possibly all these VMs can be deleted at once so the
application needs to be prepared to lose that many VMs in one step. Mutually
exclusive with 'max\-scaled\-in\-replicas'.

.TP 2m
\fBtime\-window\fR
How long back autoscaling should look when computing recommendations. The
autoscaler will not resize below the maximum allowed deduction subtracted from
the peak size observed in this period. Measured in seconds.

.RE
.sp
.TP 2m

At most one of these may be specified:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-region\fR=\fIREGION\fR
Region of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified, you may be
prompted to select a region.

A list of regions can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute regions list
.RE

Overrides the default \fBcompute/region\fR property value for this command
invocation.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-zone\fR=\fIZONE\fR
Zone of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified, you may be
prompted to select a zone.

A list of zones can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute zones list
.RE

Overrides the default \fBcompute/zone\fR property value for this command
invocation.
