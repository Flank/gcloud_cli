.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR \fBgcloud alpha compute instance\-groups managed
update\-autoscaling\fR updates autoscaling parameters of specified managed
instance group.

Autoscalers can use one or more policies listed below. Information on using
multiple policies can be found here:
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/autoscaler/multiple\-policies

In contrast to \fBgcloud alpha compute instance\-groups managed
set\-autoscaling\fR, this command \fBonly\fR updates specified fields. For
instance:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud alpha compute instance\-groups managed update\-autoscaling \e
  \-\-mode only\-up
.RE

would change the \fBmode\fR field of the autoscaler policy, but leave the rest
of the settings intact.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fINAME\fR
Name of the managed instance group to operate on.

.SH "FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-mode\fR=\fIMODE\fR
Set the mode of an autoscaler for a managed instance group.

You can turn off or restrict MIG autoscaler activities (scaling up, scaling
down) without changing autoscaler configuration and then having to restore it
later. Autoscaler configuration persists while the activities are turned off or
restricted, and the activities pick it up when they are turned on again or when
the restrictions are lifted.

\fIMODE\fR must be one of:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fBoff\fR
to turn off autoscaling, while keeping the new configuration.
.TP 2m
\fBon\fR
to permit autoscaling to scale up and down (default for new autoscalers).
.TP 2m
\fBonly\-up\fR
to permit autoscaling to scale only up and not down.
.RE
.sp


.TP 2m
\fB\-\-scale\-down\-control\fR=[\fImax\-scaled\-down\-replicas\fR=\fIMAX\-SCALED\-DOWN\-REPLICAS\fR],[\fImax\-scaled\-down\-replicas\-percent\fR=\fIMAX\-SCALED\-DOWN\-REPLICAS\-PERCENT\fR],[\fItime\-window\fR=\fITIME\-WINDOW\fR]
Configuration that allows slower scale down so that even if Autoscaler
recommends an abrupt scale down of a managed instance group, it will be
throttled as specified by the parameters.

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fBmax\-scaled\-down\-replicas\fR
Maximum allowed number of VMs that can be deducted from the peak recommendation
during the window. Possibly all these VMs can be deleted at once so user service
needs to be prepared to lose that many VMs in one step. Mutually exclusive with
\'max\-scaled\-down\-replicas\-percent'.

.TP 2m
\fBmax\-scaled\-down\-replicas\-percent\fR
Maximum allowed percent of VMs that can be deducted from the peak recommendation
during the window. Possibly all these VMs can be deleted at once so user service
needs to be prepared to lose that many VMs in one step. Mutually exclusive with
\'max\-scaled\-down\-replicas'.

.TP 2m
\fBtime\-window\fR
How long back autoscaling should look when computing recommendations to include
directives regarding slower scale down. Measured in seconds.

.RE

.TP 2m

At most one of these may be specified:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-region\fR=\fIREGION\fR
Region of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified, you may be
prompted to select a region.

A list of regions can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute regions list
.RE

Overrides the default \fBcompute/region\fR property value for this command
invocation.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-zone\fR=\fIZONE\fR
Zone of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified, you may be
prompted to select a zone.

A list of zones can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute zones list
.RE

Overrides the default \fBcompute/zone\fR property value for this command
invocation.

.SH "NOTES"

This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right project,
you may be trying to access an API with an invitation\-only early access
whitelist. This variant is also available:
