.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(ALPHA)\fR Each task returned from this command will have its schedule time
changed based on the lease duration specified. A task that has been returned by
calling this command will not be returned in a different call before its
schedule time. After the work associated with a task is finished, the lease
holder should call \f5gcloud tasks acknowledge\fR on the task.



.SH "REQUIRED FLAGS"

\fB\-\-lease\-duration\fR=\fILEASE_DURATION\fR
The number of seconds for the desired new lease duration for all tasks leased,
starting from now. The maximum lease duration is 1 week.

time.

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-filter\fR=\fIEXPRESSION\fR
Apply a Boolean filter \fIEXPRESSION\fR to each resource item to be listed. If
the expression evaluates \f5True\fR, then that item is listed. For more details
and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters. This flag
interacts with other flags that are applied in this order: \fB\-\-flatten\fR,
\fB\-\-sort\-by\fR, \fB\-\-filter\fR, \fB\-\-limit\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-limit\fR=\fILIMIT\fR; default=1000
The maximum number of tasks to lease. The maximum that can be requested is 1000.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-sort\-by\fR=[\fIFIELD\fR,...]
Comma\-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The default order
is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending order on that field. This
flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
\fB\-\-flatten\fR, \fB\-\-sort\-by\fR, \fB\-\-filter\fR, \fB\-\-limit\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-uri\fR
Print a list of resource URIs instead of the default output.
