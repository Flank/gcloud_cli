.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fBgcloud compute backend\-services add\-backend\fR is used to add a backend to
a backend service. A backend is a group of tasks that can handle requests sent
to a backend service. Currently, the group of tasks can be one or more Google
Compute Engine virtual machine instances grouped together using an instance
group.

Traffic is first spread evenly across all virtual machines in the group. When
the group is full, traffic is sent to the next nearest group(s) that still have
remaining capacity.

To modify the parameters of a backend after it has been added to the backend
service, use \f5gcloud compute backend\-services update\-backend\fR or \f5gcloud
compute backend\-services edit\fR.

.SH "OPTIONAL FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-balancing\-mode\fR=\fIBALANCING_MODE\fR
Defines the strategy for balancing load. \fIBALANCING_MODE\fR must be one of:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fBCONNECTION\fR
Spreads load based on how many concurrent connections the group can handle.
There are two ways to specify max connections: \fB\-\-max\-connections\fR which
defines the max number of connections for the whole group or
\fB\-\-max\-connections\-per\-instance\fR, which defines the max number of
connections on a per\-instance basis. Available for all services.
.TP 2m
\fBRATE\fR
Spreads load based on how many requests per second (RPS) the group can handle.
There are two ways to specify max RPS: \fB\-\-max\-rate\fR which defines the max
RPS for the whole group or \fB\-\-max\-rate\-per\-instance\fR, which defines the
max RPS on a per\-instance basis. Available only for HTTP\-based protocols.
.TP 2m
\fBUTILIZATION\fR
Relies on the CPU utilization of the instances in the group when balancing load.
Use \fB\-\-max\-utilization\fR to set a maximum target CPU utilization for each
instance. Use \fB\-\-max\-rate\-per\-instance\fR or \fB\-\-max\-rate\fR to
optionally limit based on RPS in addition to CPU. You can optionally also limit
based on connections (for TCP/SSL) in addition to CPU by setting
\fB\-\-max\-connections\fR or \fB\-\-max\-connections\-per\-instance\fR.
Available for all services without \fB\-\-load\-balancing\-scheme INTERNAL\fR.


.RE
.sp
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-capacity\-scaler\fR=\fICAPACITY_SCALER\fR
A setting that applies to all balancing modes. This value is multiplied by the
balancing mode value to set the current max usage of the instance group.
Acceptable values are \f50.0\fR (0%) through \f51.0\fR (100%). Setting this
value to \f50.0\fR (0%) drains the backend service. Note that draining a backend
service only prevents new connections to instances in the group. All existing
connections are allowed to continue until they close by normal means.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-description\fR=\fIDESCRIPTION\fR
An optional, textual description for the backend.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-max\-utilization\fR=\fIMAX_UTILIZATION\fR
The maximum average CPU utilization of the backend service. Acceptable values
are \f50.0\fR (0%) through \f51.0\fR (100%). This flag can only be provided when
the balancing mode is \fBUTILIZATION\fR.

.TP 2m

At most one of these may be specified:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-global\fR
If provided, it is assumed the backend service is global.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-region\fR=\fIREGION\fR
The region of the backend service to operate on. Overrides the default
\fBcompute/region\fR property value for this command invocation.

.RE
.sp
.TP 2m

At most one of these may be specified:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-instance\-group\-region\fR=\fIINSTANCE_GROUP_REGION\fR
The region of the instance group to add to the backend service. If not
specified, you may be prompted to select a region.

To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
\f5\fIcompute/region\fR\fR property:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config set compute/region REGION
.RE

A list of regions can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute regions list
.RE

To unset the property, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config unset compute/region
.RE

Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
\f5\fICLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION\fR\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-instance\-group\-zone\fR=\fIINSTANCE_GROUP_ZONE\fR
The zone of the instance group to add to the backend service. If not specified
and the \f5\fIcompute/zone\fR\fR property isn't set, you may be prompted to
select a zone.

To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
\f5\fIcompute/zone\fR\fR property:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE
.RE

A list of zones can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute zones list
.RE

To unset the property, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config unset compute/zone
.RE

Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
\f5\fICLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE\fR\fR.

.TP 2m

At most one of these may be specified:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-max\-connections\fR=\fIMAX_CONNECTIONS\fR
Maximum concurrent connections that the group can handle. Valid only for TCP/SSL
connections.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-max\-connections\-per\-instance\fR=\fIMAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_INSTANCE\fR
The maximum concurrent connections per instance. Valid only for TCP/SSL
connections.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-max\-rate\fR=\fIMAX_RATE\fR
Maximum number of requests per second that can be sent to the instance group.
Must not be used with Autoscaled Managed Instance Groups. \f5\-\-max\-rate\fR
and \f5\-\-max\-rate\-per\-instance\fR are mutually exclusive. However, one of
them can be set even if \f5\-\-balancing\-mode\fR is set to \f5UTILIZATION\fR.
If either \f5\-\-max\-rate\fR or \f5\-\-max\-rate\-per\-instance\fR is set and
\f5\-\-balancing\-mode\fR is set to \f5RATE\fR, then only that value is
considered when judging capacity. If either \f5\-\-max\-rate\fR or
\f5\-\-max\-rate\-per\-instance\fR is set and \f5\-\-balancing\-mode\fR is set
to \f5UTILIZATION\fR, then instances are judged to be at capacity when either
the \f5UTILIZATION\fR or \f5RATE\fR value is reached.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-max\-rate\-per\-instance\fR=\fIMAX_RATE_PER_INSTANCE\fR
Maximum number of requests per second that can be sent to each instance in the
instance group. \f5\-\-max\-rate\fR and \f5\-\-max\-rate\-per\-instance\fR are
mutually exclusive. However, one of them can be set even if
\f5\-\-balancing\-mode\fR is set to \f5UTILIZATION\fR. If either
\f5\-\-max\-rate\fR or \f5\-\-max\-rate\-per\-instance\fR is set and
\f5\-\-balancing\-mode\fR is set to \f5RATE\fR, then only that value is
considered when judging capacity. If either \f5\-\-max\-rate\fR or
\f5\-\-max\-rate\-per\-instance\fR is set and \f5\-\-balancing\-mode\fR is set
to \f5UTILIZATION\fR, then instances are judged to be at capacity when either
the \f5UTILIZATION\fR or \f5RATE\fR value is reached.
