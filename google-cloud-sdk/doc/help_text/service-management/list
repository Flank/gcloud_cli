NAME
    gcloud service-management list - list services for a project

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud service-management list [--available | --enabled | --produced]
        [--filter=EXPRESSION] [--limit=LIMIT] [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE]
        [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]] [--uri] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (REMOVED) List services for a project.

    The service-management list command has been replaced by endpoints services
    list and services list.

    This command lists the services that are produced, enabled, or available to
    be enabled by a project. You can choose the mode in which the command will
    list services by using exactly one of the --produced, --enabled, or
    --available flags. --enabled is the default.

FLAGS
     At most one of these may be specified:

       --available
          Return the services available to the project to enable. This list
          will include any services that the project has already enabled. Or
          use one of --enabled or --produced.

       --enabled
          (DEFAULT) Return the services which the project has enabled. Or use
          one of --produced or --available.

       --produced
          Return the services that the project has produced. Or use one of
          --enabled or --available.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --uri
        Print a list of resource URIs instead of the default output.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

EXAMPLES
    To list the services the current project produces, run:

        $ gcloud service-management list --produced

    To list the services the current project has enabled for consumption, run:

        $ gcloud service-management list --enabled

    To list the services the current project can enable for consumption, run:

        $ gcloud service-management list --available

NOTES
    This command is an internal implementation detail and may change or
    disappear without notice.
