NAME
    gcloud init - initialize or reinitialize gcloud

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud init [--console-only] [--skip-diagnostics] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud init launches an interactive Getting Started workflow for gcloud. It
    performs the following setup steps:

      o Authorizes gcloud and other SDK tools to access Google Cloud Platform
        using your user account credentials, or lets you select from accounts
        whose credentials are already available.
      o Sets properties in a gcloud configuration, including the current
        project and the default Google Compute Engine region and zone.

    gcloud init can be used for initial setup of gcloud and to create new or
    reinitialize gcloud configurations. More information can be found by
    running gcloud topic configurations.

    Properties set by gcloud init are local and persistent, and are not
    affected by remote changes to the project. For example, the default Compute
    Engine zone in your configuration remains stable, even if you or another
    user changes the project-level default zone in the Cloud Platform Console.

    To sync the configuration, re-run gcloud init

FLAGS
     --console-only
        Prevent the command from launching a browser for authorization.

     --skip-diagnostics
        Do not run diagnostics.

    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.
