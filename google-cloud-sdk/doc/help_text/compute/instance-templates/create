DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute instance-templates create facilitates the creation of Google
    Compute Engine virtual machine instance templates. For example, running:

        $ gcloud compute instance-templates create INSTANCE-TEMPLATE

    will create one instance templates called 'INSTANCE-TEMPLATE'.

    Instance templates are global resources, and can be used to create
    instances in any zone.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the instance template to create.

FLAGS
     --accelerator=[count=COUNT],[type=TYPE]
        Attaches accelerators (e.g. GPUs) to the instances.

         type
            The specific type (e.g. nvidia-tesla-k80 for nVidia Tesla K80) of
            accelerator to attach to the instances. Use 'gcloud compute
            accelerator-types list' to learn about all available accelerator
            types.

         count
            Number of accelerators to attach to each instance. The default
            value is 1.

     --boot-disk-auto-delete
        Automatically delete boot disks when their instances are deleted.
        Enabled by default, use --no-boot-disk-auto-delete to disable.

     --boot-disk-device-name=BOOT_DISK_DEVICE_NAME
        The name the guest operating system will see for the boot disk. This
        option can only be specified if a new boot disk is being created (as
        opposed to mounting an existing persistent disk).

     --boot-disk-size=BOOT_DISK_SIZE
        The size of the boot disk. This option can only be specified if a new
        boot disk is being created (as opposed to mounting an existing
        persistent disk). The value must be a whole number followed by a size
        unit of KB for kilobyte, MB for megabyte, GB for gigabyte, or TB for
        terabyte. For example, 10GB will produce a 10 gigabyte disk. The
        minimum size a boot disk can have is 10 GB. Disk size must be a
        multiple of 1 GB. Limit boot disk size to 2TB to account for MBR
        partition table limitations.

     --boot-disk-type=BOOT_DISK_TYPE
        The type of the boot disk. This option can only be specified if a new
        boot disk is being created (as opposed to mounting an existing
        persistent disk). To get a list of available disk types, run $ gcloud
        compute disk-types list.

     --can-ip-forward
        If provided, allows the instances to send and receive packets with
        non-matching destination or source IP addresses.

     --configure-disk=[PROPERTY=VALUE,...]
        This option has effect only when used with --source-instance. It allows
        you to override how the source-instance's disks are defined in the
        template.

         auto-delete
            If true, this persistent disk will be automatically deleted when
            the instance is deleted. However, if the disk is later detached
            from the instance, this option won't apply. If not provided, the
            setting is copied from the source instance. Allowed values of the
            flag are: false, no, true, and yes.

         device-name
            Name of the device.

         instantiate-from
            Specifies whether to include the disk and which image to use. Valid
            values are: attach-read-only, blank, custom-image, do-not-include,
            source-image, source-image-family

         custom-image
            The custom image to use if custom-image is specified for
            instantiate-from.

     --create-disk=[PROPERTY=VALUE,...]
        Creates and attaches persistent disks to the instances.

         name
            Specifies the name of the disk. This option cannot be specified if
            more than one instance is being created.

         description
            Optional textual description for the disk being created.

         mode
            Specifies the mode of the disk. Supported options are ro for
            read-only and rw for read-write. If omitted, rw is used as a
            default.

         image
            Specifies the name of the image that the disk will be initialized
            with. A new disk will be created based on the given image. To view
            a list of public images and projects, run $ gcloud compute images
            list. It is best practice to use image when a specific version of
            an image is needed. If both image and image-family flags are
            omitted a blank disk will be created.

         image-family
            The family of the image that the disk will be initialized with.
            When a family is specified instead of an image, the latest
            non-deprecated image associated with that family is used. It is
            best practice to use image-family when the latest version of an
            image is needed.

         image-project
            The project that the image or image family belongs to. It is best
            practice to define image-project.
            + If specifying one of our public images, image-project must be
              provided.
            + If there are several of the same image-family value in multiple
              projects, image-project must be specified to clarify the image to
              be used.
            + If not specified and either image or image-family is provided,
              the current default project is used.

         size
            The size of the disk. The value must be a whole number followed by
            a size unit of KB for kilobyte, MB for megabyte, GB for gigabyte,
            or TB for terabyte. For example, 10GB will produce a 10 gigabyte
            disk. Disk size must be a multiple of 1 GB. If not specified, the
            default image size will be used for the new disk.

         type
            The type of the disk. To get a list of available disk types, run $
            gcloud compute disk-types list. The default disk type is
            pd-standard.

         device-name
            An optional name that indicates the disk name the guest operating
            system will see. If omitted, a device name of the form
            persistent-disk-N will be used.

         auto-delete
            If yes, this persistent disk will be automatically deleted when the
            instance is deleted. However, if the disk is later detached from
            the instance, this option won't apply. The default value for this
            is no.

         kms-key
            Fully qualified Cloud KMS cryptokey name that will protect the
            disk. This can either be the fully qualified path or the name. The
            fully qualified Cloud KMS cryptokey name format is:
            projects/<kms-project>/locations/<kms-location>/keyRings/<kms-keyring>/
            cryptoKeys/<key-name>. If the value is not fully qualified then
            kms-location, kms-keyring, and optionally kms-project are required.
            See
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-managed-encryption
            for more details.

         kms-project
            Project that contains the Cloud KMS cryptokey that will protect the
            disk. If the project is not specified then the project where the
            disk is being created will be used. If this flag is set then
            key-location, kms-keyring, and kms-key are required. See
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-managed-encryption
            for more details.

         kms-location
            Location of the Cloud KMS cryptokey to be used for protecting the
            disk. All Cloud KMS cryptokeys are reside in a 'location'. To get a
            list of possible locations run 'gcloud kms locations list'. If this
            flag is set then kms-keyring and kms-key are required. See
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-managed-encryption
            for more details.

         kms-keyring
            The keyring which contains the Cloud KMS cryptokey that will
            protect the disk. If this flag is set then kms-location and kms-key
            are required. See
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-managed-encryption
            for more details.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Specifies a textual description for the instance template.

     --disk=[auto-delete=AUTO-DELETE],[boot=BOOT],[device-name=DEVICE-NAME],[mode=MODE],[name=NAME]
        Attaches persistent disks to the instances. The disks specified must
        already exist.

         name
            The disk to attach to the instances. When creating more than one
            instance and using this property, the only valid mode for attaching
            the disk is read-only (see mode below).

         mode
            Specifies the mode of the disk. Supported options are ro for
            read-only and rw for read-write. If omitted, rw is used as a
            default. It is an error for mode to be rw when creating more than
            one instance because read-write disks can only be attached to a
            single instance.

         boot
            If yes, indicates that this is a boot disk. The virtual machines
            will use the first partition of the disk for their root file
            systems. The default value for this is no.

         device-name
            An optional name that indicates the disk name the guest operating
            system will see. If omitted, a device name of the form
            persistent-disk-N will be used.

         auto-delete
            If yes, this persistent disk will be automatically deleted when the
            instance is deleted. However, if the disk is later detached from
            the instance, this option won't apply. The default value for this
            is yes.

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     --local-ssd=[device-name=DEVICE-NAME],[interface=INTERFACE]
        Attaches a local SSD to the instances.

         device-name
            Optional. A name that indicates the disk name the guest operating
            system will see. Can only be specified if interface is SCSI. If
            omitted, a device name of the form local-ssd-N will be used.

         interface
            Optional. The kind of disk interface exposed to the VM for this
            SSD. Valid values are SCSI and NVME. SCSI is the default and is
            supported by more guest operating systems. NVME may provide higher
            performance.

     --machine-type=MACHINE_TYPE
        Specifies the machine type used for the instances. To get a list of
        available machine types, run 'gcloud compute machine-types list'. If
        unspecified, the default type is n1-standard-1.

     --maintenance-policy=MAINTENANCE_POLICY
        Specifies the behavior of the instances when their host machines
        undergo maintenance. The default is MIGRATE. MAINTENANCE_POLICY must be
        one of:

         MIGRATE
            The instances should be migrated to a new host. This will
            temporarily impact the performance of instances during a migration
            event.
         TERMINATE
            The instances should be terminated.

     --metadata=KEY=VALUE,[KEY=VALUE,...]
        Metadata to be made available to the guest operating system running on
        the instances. Each metadata entry is a key/value pair separated by an
        equals sign. Metadata keys must be unique and less than 128 bytes in
        length. Values must be less than or equal to 32,768 bytes in length.
        Multiple arguments can be passed to this flag, e.g., --metadata
        key-1=value-1,key-2=value-2,key-3=value-3.

        In images that have Compute Engine tools installed on them, such as the
        official images (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images), the
        following metadata keys have special meanings:

         startup-script
            Specifies a script that will be executed by the instances once they
            start running. For convenience, --metadata-from-file can be used to
            pull the value from a file.

         startup-script-url
            Same as startup-script except that the script contents are pulled
            from a publicly-accessible location on the web.

     --metadata-from-file=KEY=LOCAL_FILE_PATH,[...]
        Same as --metadata except that the value for the entry will be read
        from a local file. This is useful for values that are too large such as
        startup-script contents.

     --min-cpu-platform=PLATFORM
        When specified, the VM will be scheduled on host with specified CPU
        architecture or a newer one. To list available CPU platforms in given
        zone, run:

            $ gcloud compute zones describe ZONE \
              --format="value(availableCpuPlatforms)"

        Default setting is "AUTOMATIC".

        CPU platform selection is available only in selected zones.

        You can find more information on-line:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/specify-min-cpu-platform

     --network=NETWORK
        Specifies the network that the instances will be part of. If --subnet
        is also specified subnet must be a subnetwork of network specified by
        --network. If neither is specified, this defaults to the "default"
        network.

     --network-interface=[PROPERTY=VALUE,...]
        Adds a network interface to the instance. Mutually exclusive with any
        of these flags: --address, --network, --network-tier, --subnet,
        --private-network-ip. This flag can be repeated to specify multiple
        network interfaces.

        The following keys are allowed:
         address
            Assigns the given external address to the instance that is created.
            Specifying an empty string will assign an ephemeral IP. Mutually
            exclusive with no-address. If neither key is present the instance
            will get an ephemeral IP.

         network
            Specifies the network that the interface will be part of. If subnet
            is also specified it must be subnetwork of this network. If neither
            is specified, this defaults to the "default" network.

         no-address
            If specified the interface will have no external IP. Mutually
            exclusive with address. If neither key is present the instance will
            get an ephemeral IP.

         network-tier
            Specifies the network tier of the interface. NETWORK_TIER must be
            one of: PREMIUM, STANDARD. The default value is PREMIUM.

         subnet
            Specifies the subnet that the interface will be part of. If network
            key is also specified this must be a subnetwork of the specified
            network.

         aliases
            Specifies the IP alias ranges to allocate for this interface. If
            there are multiple IP alias ranges, they are separated by
            semicolons.

            For example:

                --aliases="10.128.1.0/24;range1:/32"

            Each IP alias range consists of a range name and an CIDR netmask
            (e.g. /24) separated by a colon, or just the netmask. The range
            name is the name of the range within the network interface's subnet
            from which to allocate an IP alias range. If unspecified, it
            defaults to the primary IP range of the subnet. The IP allocator
            will pick an available range with the specified netmask and
            allocate it to this network interface.

     --network-tier=NETWORK_TIER
        Specifies the network tier that will be used to configure the instance.
        NETWORK_TIER must be one of: PREMIUM, STANDARD. The default value is
        PREMIUM.

     --preemptible
        If provided, instances will be preemptible and time-limited. Instances
        may be preempted to free up resources for standard VM instances, and
        will only be able to run for a limited amount of time. Preemptible
        instances can not be restarted and will not migrate.

     --region=REGION
        Region of the subnetwork to attach. If not specified, you may be
        prompted to select a region.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     --restart-on-failure
        The instances will be restarted if they are terminated by Compute
        Engine. This does not affect terminations performed by the user.
        Enabled by default, use --no-restart-on-failure to disable.

     --shielded-integrity-monitoring
        Enables monitoring and attestation of the boot integrity of the
        instance. The attestation is performed against the integrity policy
        baseline. This baseline is initially derived from the implicitly
        trusted boot image when the instance is created. This baseline can be
        updated by using --shielded-vm-learn-integrity-policy.

     --shielded-secure-boot
        The instance will boot with secure boot enabled.

     --shielded-vtpm
        The instance will boot with the TPM (Trusted Platform Module) enabled.
        A TPM is a hardware module that can be used for different security
        operations such as remote attestation, encryption and sealing of keys.

     --source-instance=SOURCE_INSTANCE
        The name of the source instance that the instance template will be
        created from.

        You can override machine type and labels. Values of other flags will be
        ignored and values from the source instance will be used instead.

     --source-instance-zone=SOURCE_INSTANCE_ZONE
        Zone of the instance to operate on. Overrides the default compute/zone
        property value for this command invocation.

     --subnet=SUBNET
        Specifies the subnet that the instances will be part of. If --network
        is also specified subnet must be a subnetwork of network specified by
        --network.

     --tags=TAG,[TAG,...]
        Specifies a list of tags to apply to the instance. These tags allow
        network firewall rules and routes to be applied to specified VM
        instances. See gcloud compute firewall-rules create(1) for more
        details.

        To read more about configuring network tags, read this guide:
        https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/add-remove-network-tags

        To list instances with their respective status and tags, run:

            $ gcloud compute instances list \
                --format='table(name,status,tags.list())'

        To list instances tagged with a specific tag, tag1, run:

            $ gcloud compute instances list --filter='tags:tag1'

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --address=ADDRESS
          Assigns the given external IP address to the instance that is
          created. This option can only be used when creating a single
          instance.

       --no-address
          If provided, the instances will not be assigned external IP
          addresses.

     Key resource - The Cloud KMS (Key Management Service) cryptokey that will
     be used to protect the disk. The arguments in this group can be used to
     specify the attributes of this resource.

       --boot-disk-kms-key=BOOT_DISK_KMS_KEY
          ID of the key or fully qualified identifier for the key. This flag
          must be specified if any of the other arguments in this group are
          specified.

       --boot-disk-kms-keyring=BOOT_DISK_KMS_KEYRING
          The KMS keyring of the key.

       --boot-disk-kms-location=BOOT_DISK_KMS_LOCATION
          The Cloud location for the key.

       --boot-disk-kms-project=BOOT_DISK_KMS_PROJECT
          The Cloud project for the key.

     Custom machine type extensions.

       --custom-cpu=CUSTOM_CPU
          A whole number value indicating how many cores are desired in the
          custom machine type. This flag must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --custom-memory=CUSTOM_MEMORY
          A whole number value indicating how much memory is desired in the
          custom machine type. A size unit should be provided (eg. 3072MB or
          9GB) - if no units are specified, GB is assumed. This flag must be
          specified if any of the other arguments in this group are specified.

       --custom-extensions
          Use the extended custom machine type.

       --custom-vm-type=CUSTOM_VM_TYPE
          Specifies VM type. n1 - VMs with CPU platforms Skylake and older, n2
          - VMs with CPU platform Cascade Lake. n2 offers flexible sizing from
          2 to 80 vCPUs, and 1 to 640GBs of memory. It also features a number
          of performance enhancements including exposing a more accurate NUMA
          topology to the guest OS. The default is n1.

     --image-project=IMAGE_PROJECT
        The project against which all image and image family references will be
        resolved. It is best practice to define image-project.
        * If specifying one of our public images, image-project must be
          provided.
        * If there are several of the same image-family value in multiple
          projects, image-project must be specified to clarify the image to be
          used.
        * If not specified and either image or image-family is provided, the
          current default project is used.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --image=IMAGE
          Specifies the boot image for the instances. For each instance, a new
          boot disk will be created from the given image. Each boot disk will
          have the same name as the instance. To view a list of public images
          and projects, run $ gcloud compute images list. It is best practice
          to use --image when a specific version of an image is needed.

          When using this option, --boot-disk-device-name and --boot-disk-size
          can be used to override the boot disk's device name and size,
          respectively.

       --image-family=IMAGE_FAMILY
          The family of the image that the boot disk will be initialized with.
          When a family is specified instead of an image, the latest
          non-deprecated image associated with that family is used. It is best
          practice to use --image-family when the latest version of an image is
          needed.

          By default, debian-9 is assumed for this flag.

     Sole Tenancy. At most one of these may be specified:

       --node=NODE
          The name of the node to schedule this instance on.

       --node-affinity-file=NODE_AFFINITY_FILE
          The JSON/YAML file containing the configuration of desired nodes onto
          which this instance could be scheduled. These rules filter the nodes
          according to their node affinity labels. A node's affinity labels
          come from the node template of the group the node is in.

          The file should contain a list of a JSON/YAML objects with the
          following fields:

       key
          Corresponds to the node affinity label keys of the Node resource.
       operator
          Specifies the node selection type. Must be one of: IN: Requires
          Compute Engine to seek for matched nodes. NOT_IN: Requires Compute
          Engine to avoid certain nodes.
       values
          Optional. A list of values which correspond to the node affinity
          label values of the Node resource.

       --node-group=NODE_GROUP
          The name of the node group to schedule this instance on.

     Specifies the reservation for instances created from this template.

       --reservation=RESERVATION
          The name of the reservation, required when
          --reservation-affinity=specific.

       --reservation-affinity=RESERVATION_AFFINITY; default="any"
          The type of reservation for instances created from this template.
          RESERVATION_AFFINITY must be one of: any, none, specific.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --scopes=[SCOPE,...]
          If not provided, the instance will be assigned the default scopes,
          described below.

          SCOPE can be either the full URI of the scope or an alias. default
          scopes are assigned to all instances. Available aliases are:

       --no-scopes
          Create instance without scopes

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --service-account=SERVICE_ACCOUNT
          A service account is an identity attached to the instance. Its access
          tokens can be accessed through the instance metadata server and are
          used to authenticate applications on the instance. The account can be
          set using an email address corresponding to the required service
          account. You can explicitly specify the Compute Engine default
          service account using the 'default' alias.

          If not provided, the instance will get project's default service
          account.

       --no-service-account
          Create instance without service account
