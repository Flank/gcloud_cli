DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute instance-templates create-with-container creates a Google
    Compute Engine virtual machine instance template that runs a container
    image. For example:

        $ gcloud compute instance-templates create-with-container \
            instance-template-1              \
            --container-image=gcr.io/google-containers/busybox

    creates an instance template that runs the 'busybox' image. The created
    instance template will have the name 'instance-template-1'

    For more examples, refer to the EXAMPLES section below.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the instance template to create.

FLAGS
     --boot-disk-auto-delete
        Automatically delete boot disks when their instances are deleted.
        Enabled by default, use --no-boot-disk-auto-delete to disable.

     --boot-disk-device-name=BOOT_DISK_DEVICE_NAME
        The name the guest operating system will see for the boot disk. This
        option can only be specified if a new boot disk is being created (as
        opposed to mounting an existing persistent disk).

     --boot-disk-size=BOOT_DISK_SIZE
        The size of the boot disk. This option can only be specified if a new
        boot disk is being created (as opposed to mounting an existing
        persistent disk). The value must be a whole number followed by a size
        unit of KB for kilobyte, MB for megabyte, GB for gigabyte, or TB for
        terabyte. For example, 10GB will produce a 10 gigabyte disk. The
        minimum size a boot disk can have is 10 GB. Disk size must be a
        multiple of 1 GB. Limit your boot disk size to 2TB to account for MBR
        partition table limitations.

     --boot-disk-type=BOOT_DISK_TYPE
        The type of the boot disk. This option can only be specified if a new
        boot disk is being created (as opposed to mounting an existing
        persistent disk). To get a list of available disk types, run $ gcloud
        compute disk-types list.

     --can-ip-forward
        If provided, allows the instances to send and receive packets with
        non-matching destination or source IP addresses.

     --container-arg=CONTAINER_ARG
        Argument to append to container entrypoint or to override container
        CMD. Each argument must have a separate flag. Arguments are appended in
        the order of flags. Example:

        Assuming the default entry point of your container (or an entry point
        overridden with --container-command flag) is a Bourne shell-compatible
        executable, in order to execute 'ls -l' command in the container, you
        could use:

        --container-arg="-c" --container-arg="ls -l"

        Caveat: due to the nature of the argument parsing, it's impossible to
        provide the flag value that starts with a dash (-) without the = sign
        (that is, --container-arg "-c" will not work correctly).

        Default: None. (no arguments appended)

     --container-command=CONTAINER_COMMAND
        Specifies what executable to run when the container starts (overrides
        default entrypoint), eg. nc.

        Default: None (default container entrypoint is used)

     --container-env=[KEY=VALUE, ...,...]
        Declare environment variables KEY with value VALUE passed to container.
        Only the last value of KEY is taken when KEY is repeated more than
        once.

        Values, declared with --container-env flag override those with the same
        KEY from file, provided in --container-env-file.

     --container-env-file=CONTAINER_ENV_FILE
        Declare environment variables in a file. Values, declared with
        --container-env flag override those with the same KEY from file.

        File with environment variables in format used by docker (almost). This
        means:
        * Lines are in format KEY=VALUE.
        * Values must contain equality signs.
        * Variables without values are not supported (this is different from
          docker format).
        * If # is first non-whitespace character in a line the line is
          ignored as a comment.
        * Lines with nothing but whitespace are ignored.

     --container-image=CONTAINER_IMAGE
        Full container image name, which should be pulled onto VM instance, eg.
        docker.io/tomcat.

     --container-mount-disk=[mode=MODE],[mount-path=MOUNT-PATH],[name=NAME],[partition=PARTITION]
        Mounts a disk to the specified mount path in the container. Multiple '
        flags are allowed. Must be used with --disk or --create-disk.

         name
            Name of the disk. If exactly one additional disk is attached to the
            instance using --disk or --create-disk, specifying disk name here
            is optional. The name of the single additional disk will be used by
            default.

         mount-path
            Path on container to mount to. Mount paths with spaces and commas
            (and other special characters) are not supported by this command.

         partition
            Optional. The partition of the disk to mount. Multiple partitions
            of a disk may be mounted. May not be used with --create-disk.

         mode
            Volume mount mode: rw (read/write) or ro (read-only). Defaults to
            rw. Fails if the disk mode is ro and volume mount mode is rw.

     --container-mount-host-path=[host-path=HOSTPATH,mount-path=MOUNTPATH[,mode=MODE],...]
        Mounts a volume by using host-path.

         host-path
            Path on host to mount from.

         mount-path
            Path on container to mount to. Mount paths with spaces and commas
            (and other special characters) are not supported by this command.

         mode
            Volume mount mode: rw (read/write) or ro (read-only).

            Default: rw.

     --container-mount-tmpfs=[mount-path=MOUNTPATH,...]
        Mounts empty tmpfs into container at MOUNTPATH.

         mount-path
            Path on container to mount to. Mount paths with spaces and commas
            (and other special characters) are not supported by this command.

     --container-privileged
        Specify whether to run container in privileged mode.

        Default: --no-container-privileged.

     --container-restart-policy=POLICY; default="always"
        Specify whether to restart a container on exit. POLICY must be one of:
        never, on-failure, always.

     --container-stdin
        Keep container STDIN open even if not attached.

        Default: --no-container-stdin.

     --container-tty
        Allocate a pseudo-TTY for the container.

        Default: --no-container-tty.

     --create-disk=[PROPERTY=VALUE,...]
        Creates and attaches persistent disks to the instances.

         name
            Specifies the name of the disk. This option cannot be specified if
            more than one instance is being created. Must specify this option
            if attaching the disk to a container with --container-mount-disk.

         description
            Optional textual description for the disk being created.

         mode
            Specifies the mode of the disk. Supported options are ro for
            read-only and rw for read-write. If omitted, rw is used as a
            default. It is an error to create a disk in ro mode if attaching it
            to a container with --container-mount-disk.

         image
            Specifies the name of the image that the disk will be initialized
            with. A new disk will be created based on the given image. To view
            a list of public images and projects, run $ gcloud compute images
            list. It is best practice to use image when a specific version of
            an image is needed. If both image and image-family flags are
            omitted a blank disk will be created.

         image-family
            The family of the image that the disk will be initialized with.
            When a family is specified instead of an image, the latest
            non-deprecated image associated with that family is used. It is
            best practice to use image-family when the latest version of an
            image is needed.

         image-project
            The project that the image or image family belongs to. It is best
            practice to define image-project.
            + If specifying one of our public images, image-project must be
              provided.
            + If there are several of the same image-family value in multiple
              projects, image-project must be specified to clarify the image to
              be used.
            + If not specified and either image or image-family is provided,
              the current default project is used.

         size
            The size of the disk. The value must be a whole number followed by
            a size unit of KB for kilobyte, MB for megabyte, GB for gigabyte,
            or TB for terabyte. For example, 10GB will produce a 10 gigabyte
            disk. Disk size must be a multiple of 1 GB. If not specified, the
            default image size will be used for the new disk.

         type
            The type of the disk. To get a list of available disk types, run $
            gcloud compute disk-types list. The default disk type is
            pd-standard.

         device-name
            An optional name that indicates the disk name the guest operating
            system will see. Must be the same as name if used with
            --container-mount-disk. If omitted, a device name of the form
            persistent-disk-N will be used. If omitted and used with
            --container-mount-disk (where the name of the container mount disk
            is the same as in this flag), a device name equal to disk name will
            be used.

         auto-delete
            If yes, this persistent disk will be automatically deleted when the
            instance is deleted. However, if the disk is later detached from
            the instance, this option won't apply. The default value for this
            is no.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Specifies a textual description for the instance template.

     --disk=[auto-delete=AUTO-DELETE],[boot=BOOT],[device-name=DEVICE-NAME],[mode=MODE],[name=NAME]
        Attaches persistent disks to the instances. The disks specified must
        already exist.

         name
            The disk to attach to the instances. When creating more than one
            instance and using this property, the only valid mode for attaching
            the disk is read-only (see mode below).

         mode
            Specifies the mode of the disk. Supported options are ro for
            read-only and rw for read-write. If omitted, rw is used as a
            default. It is an error for mode to be rw when creating more than
            one instance because read-write disks can only be attached to a
            single instance.

         boot
            If yes, indicates that this is a boot disk. The virtual machines
            will use the first partition of the disk for their root file
            systems. The default value for this is no.

         device-name
            An optional name that indicates the disk name the guest operating
            system will see. Must be the same as name if used with
            --container-mount-disk. If omitted, a device name of the form
            persistent-disk-N will be used. If omitted and used with
            --container-mount-disk (where the name of the container mount disk
            is the same as in this flag), a device name equal to disk name will
            be used.

         auto-delete
            If yes, this persistent disk will be automatically deleted when the
            instance is deleted. However, if the disk is later detached from
            the instance, this option won't apply. The default value for this
            is yes.

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     --machine-type=MACHINE_TYPE
        Specifies the machine type used for the instances. To get a list of
        available machine types, run 'gcloud compute machine-types list'. If
        unspecified, the default type is n1-standard-1.

     --maintenance-policy=MAINTENANCE_POLICY
        Specifies the behavior of the instances when their host machines
        undergo maintenance. The default is MIGRATE. MAINTENANCE_POLICY must be
        one of:

         MIGRATE
            The instances should be migrated to a new host. This will
            temporarily impact the performance of instances during a migration
            event.
         TERMINATE
            The instances should be terminated.

     --metadata=KEY=VALUE,[KEY=VALUE,...]
        Metadata to be made available to the guest operating system running on
        the instances. Each metadata entry is a key/value pair separated by an
        equals sign. Metadata keys must be unique and less than 128 bytes in
        length. Values must be less than or equal to 32,768 bytes in length.
        Multiple arguments can be passed to this flag, e.g., --metadata
        key-1=value-1,key-2=value-2,key-3=value-3.

        In images that have Compute Engine tools installed on them, such as the
        official images (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images), the
        following metadata keys have special meanings:

         startup-script
            Specifies a script that will be executed by the instances once they
            start running. For convenience, --metadata-from-file can be used to
            pull the value from a file.

         startup-script-url
            Same as startup-script except that the script contents are pulled
            from a publicly-accessible location on the web.

     --metadata-from-file=KEY=LOCAL_FILE_PATH,[...]
        Same as --metadata except that the value for the entry will be read
        from a local file. This is useful for values that are too large such as
        startup-script contents.

     --min-cpu-platform=PLATFORM
        When specified, the VM will be scheduled on host with specified CPU
        architecture or a newer one. To list available CPU platforms in given
        zone, run:

            $ gcloud compute zones describe ZONE \
              --format="value(availableCpuPlatforms)"

        Default setting is "AUTOMATIC".

        CPU platform selection is available only in selected zones.

        You can find more information on-line:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/specify-min-cpu-platform

     --network=NETWORK
        Specifies the network that the instances will be part of. If --subnet
        is also specified subnet must be a subnetwork of network specified by
        --network. If neither is specified, this defaults to the "default"
        network.

     --network-interface=[PROPERTY=VALUE,...]
        Adds a network interface to the instance. Mutually exclusive with any
        of these flags: --address, --network, --network-tier, --subnet,
        --private-network-ip. This flag can be repeated to specify multiple
        network interfaces.

        The following keys are allowed:
         address
            Assigns the given external address to the instance that is created.
            Specifying an empty string will assign an ephemeral IP. Mutually
            exclusive with no-address. If neither key is present the instance
            will get an ephemeral IP.

         network
            Specifies the network that the interface will be part of. If subnet
            is also specified it must be subnetwork of this network. If neither
            is specified, this defaults to the "default" network.

         no-address
            If specified the interface will have no external IP. Mutually
            exclusive with address. If neither key is present the instance will
            get an ephemeral IP.

         network-tier
            Specifies the network tier of the interface. NETWORK_TIER must be
            one of: PREMIUM, STANDARD. The default value is PREMIUM.

         subnet
            Specifies the subnet that the interface will be part of. If network
            key is also specified this must be a subnetwork of the specified
            network.

         aliases
            Specifies the IP alias ranges to allocate for this interface. If
            there are multiple IP alias ranges, they are separated by
            semicolons.

            For example:

                --aliases="10.128.1.0/24;range1:/32"

            Each IP alias range consists of a range name and an CIDR netmask
            (e.g. /24) separated by a colon, or just the netmask. The range
            name is the name of the range within the network interface's subnet
            from which to allocate an IP alias range. If unspecified, it
            defaults to the primary IP range of the subnet. The IP allocator
            will pick an available range with the specified netmask and
            allocate it to this network interface.

     --network-tier=NETWORK_TIER
        Specifies the network tier that will be used to configure the instance.
        NETWORK_TIER must be one of: PREMIUM, STANDARD. The default value is
        PREMIUM.

     --preemptible
        If provided, instances will be preemptible and time-limited. Instances
        may be preempted to free up resources for standard VM instances, and
        will only be able to run for a limited amount of time. Preemptible
        instances can not be restarted and will not migrate.

     --region=REGION
        Region of the instance template to create. If not specified, you may be
        prompted to select a region.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     --restart-on-failure
        The instances will be restarted if they are terminated by Compute
        Engine. This does not affect terminations performed by the user.
        Enabled by default, use --no-restart-on-failure to disable.

     --subnet=SUBNET
        Specifies the subnet that the instances will be part of. If --network
        is also specified subnet must be a subnetwork of network specified by
        --network.

     --tags=TAG,[TAG,...]
        Specifies a list of tags to apply to the instance. These tags allow
        network firewall rules and routes to be applied to specified VM
        instances. See gcloud compute firewall-rules create(1) for more
        details.

        To read more about configuring network tags, read this guide:
        https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/add-remove-network-tags

        To list instances with their respective status and tags, run:

            $ gcloud compute instances list \
                --format='table(name,status,tags.list())'

        To list instances tagged with a specific tag, tag1, run:

            $ gcloud compute instances list --filter='tags:tag1'

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --address=ADDRESS
          Assigns the given external IP address to the instance that is
          created. This option can only be used when creating a single
          instance.

       --no-address
          If provided, the instances will not be assigned external IP
          addresses.

     Custom machine type extensions.

       --custom-cpu=CUSTOM_CPU
          A whole number value indicating how many cores are desired in the
          custom machine type. This flag must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --custom-memory=CUSTOM_MEMORY
          A whole number value indicating how much memory is desired in the
          custom machine type. A size unit should be provided (eg. 3072MB or
          9GB) - if no units are specified, GB is assumed. This flag must be
          specified if any of the other arguments in this group are specified.

       --custom-extensions
          Use the extended custom machine type.

     --image-project=IMAGE_PROJECT
        The project against which all image and image family references will be
        resolved. It is best practice to define image-project.
        * If specifying one of our public images, image-project must be
          provided.
        * If there are several of the same image-family value in multiple
          projects, image-project must be specified to clarify the image to be
          used.
        * If not specified and either image or image-family is provided, the
          current default project is used.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --image=IMAGE
          Specifies the boot image for the instances. For each instance, a new
          boot disk will be created from the given image. Each boot disk will
          have the same name as the instance. To view a list of public images
          and projects, run $ gcloud compute images list. It is best practice
          to use --image when a specific version of an image is needed.

          When using this option, --boot-disk-device-name and --boot-disk-size
          can be used to override the boot disk's device name and size,
          respectively.

       --image-family=IMAGE_FAMILY
          The family of the image that the boot disk will be initialized with.
          When a family is specified instead of an image, the latest
          non-deprecated image associated with that family is used. It is best
          practice to use --image-family when the latest version of an image is
          needed.

          By default, debian-9 is assumed for this flag.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --scopes=[SCOPE,...]
          If not provided, the instance will be assigned the default scopes,
          described below.

          SCOPE can be either the full URI of the scope or an alias. default
          scopes are assigned to all instances. Available aliases are:

          manage your Google SQL Service instances.

       --no-scopes
          Create instance without scopes

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --service-account=SERVICE_ACCOUNT
          A service account is an identity attached to the instance. Its access
          tokens can be accessed through the instance metadata server and are
          used to authenticate applications on the instance. The account can be
          set using an email address corresponding to the required service
          account. You can explicitly specify the Compute Engine default
          service account using the 'default' alias.

          If not provided, the instance will get project's default service
          account.

       --no-service-account
          Create instance without service account

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

EXAMPLES
    To create a template named 'instance-template-1' that runs the
    gcr.io/google-containers/busybox image and executes 'echo "Hello world"' as
    a command, run:

        $ gcloud compute instance-templates create-with-container \
            instance-template-1             \
            --container-image=gcr.io/google-containers/busybox             \
            --container-command='echo "Hello world"'

    To create a template running gcr.io/google-containers/busybox in privileged
    mode, run:

        $ gcloud compute instance-templates create-with-container \
            instance-template-1             \
            --container-image=gcr.io/google-containers/busybox             \
            --container-privileged

NOTES
    These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instance-templates create-with-container
        $ gcloud beta compute instance-templates create-with-container
