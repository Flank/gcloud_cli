NAME
    gcloud compute instances delete - delete Google Compute Engine virtual
        machine instances

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute instances delete INSTANCE_NAMES [INSTANCE_NAMES ...]
        [--zone=ZONE] [--delete-disks=DISK_TYPE | --keep-disks=DISK_TYPE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute instances delete deletes one or more Google Compute Engine
    virtual machine instances.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAMES [INSTANCE_NAMES ...]
        Names of the instances to delete.

FLAGS
     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the instances to delete. If not specified, you may be prompted
        to select a zone. gcloud will attempt to identify the zone by searching
        for resources in your project. If the zone cannot be determined, you
        will then be prompted with all Google Cloud Platform zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --delete-disks=DISK_TYPE
          The types of disks to delete with instance deletion regardless of the
          disks' auto-delete configuration. When this flag is provided, the
          auto-delete bits on the attached disks are modified accordingly
          before the instance deletion requests are issued. For more
          information on disk auto-deletion, see
          https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/persistent-disks#updateautodelete.
          DISK_TYPE must be one of:

           all
              All disk types.
           boot
              The first partition is reserved for the root filesystem.
           data
              A non-boot disk.

       --keep-disks=DISK_TYPE
          The types of disks to not delete with instance deletion regardless of
          the disks' auto-delete configuration. When this flag is provided, the
          auto-delete bits on the attached disks are modified accordingly
          before the instance deletion requests are issued. For more
          information on disk auto-deletion, see
          https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/persistent-disks#updateautodelete.
          DISK_TYPE must be one of:

           all
              All disk types.
           boot
              The first partition is reserved for the root filesystem.
           data
              A non-boot disk.
