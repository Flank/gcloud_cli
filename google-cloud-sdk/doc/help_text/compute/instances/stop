NAME
    gcloud compute instances stop - stop a virtual machine instance

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute instances stop INSTANCE_NAMES [INSTANCE_NAMES ...] [--async]
        [--zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute instances stop is used stop a Google Compute Engine virtual
    machine. Stopping a VM performs a clean shutdown, much like invoking the
    shutdown functionality of a workstation or laptop. Stopping a VM with a
    local SSD is not supported and will result in an API error.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAMES [INSTANCE_NAMES ...]
        Names of the instances to operate on.

FLAGS
     --async
        Display information about the operation in progress, without waiting
        for the operation to complete.

     --zone=ZONE
        The zone of the instances to operate on. If not specified, you may be
        prompted to select a zone. gcloud will attempt to identify the zone by
        searching for resources in your project. If the zone cannot be
        determined, you will then be prompted with all Google Cloud Platform
        zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instances stop
        $ gcloud beta compute instances stop
