DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute instances update-container updates Compute Engine virtual
    machines that runs a Docker image. For example:

        $ gcloud compute instances update-container instance-1 \
            --zone us-central1-a         \
            --container-image=gcr.io/google-containers/busybox

    updates an instance called instance-1, in the us-central1-a zone, to run
    the 'busybox' image.

    For more examples, refer to the EXAMPLES section below.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAME
        Name of the instance to update. For details on valid instance names,
        refer to the criteria documented under the field 'name' at:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances

FLAGS
     --container-image=CONTAINER_IMAGE
        Sets container image in the declaration to the specified value.

        Empty string is not allowed.

     --container-mount-disk=[mode=MODE],[mount-path=MOUNT-PATH],[name=NAME],[partition=PARTITION]
        Mounts a disk to the container by using mount-path or updates how the
        volume is mounted if the same mount path has already been declared. The
        disk must already be attached to the instance with a device-name that
        matches the disk name. Multiple flags are allowed.

         name
            Name of the disk. Can be omitted if exactly one additional disk is
            attached to the instance. The name of the single additional disk
            will be used by default.

         mount-path
            Path on container to mount to. Mount paths with spaces and commas
            (and other special characters) are not supported by this command.

         partition
            Optional. The partition of the disk to mount. Multiple partitions
            of a disk may be mounted.

         mode
            Volume mount mode: rw (read/write) or ro (read-only). Defaults to
            rw. Fails if the disk mode is ro and volume mount mode is rw.

     --container-privileged
        Sets permission to run container to the specified value.

     --container-restart-policy=POLICY
        Sets container restart policy to the specified value. POLICY must be
        one of: never, on-failure, always.

     --container-stdin
        Sets configuration whether to keep container STDIN always open to the
        specified value.

     --container-tty
        Sets configuration whether to allocate a pseudo-TTY for the container
        to the specified value.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the instance to update. If not specified, the user may be
        prompted to select a zone. gcloud will attempt to identify the zone by
        searching for resources in the user's project. If the zone cannot be
        determined, the user will then be prompted with all Google Cloud
        Platform zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, the user can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --clear-container-args
          Removes the list of arguments from container declaration.

          Cannot be used in the same command with --container-arg.

       --container-arg=CONTAINER_ARG
          Completely replaces the list of arguments with the new list. Each
          argument must have a separate --container-arg flag. Arguments are
          appended the new list in the order of flags.

          Cannot be used in the same command with --clear-container-arg.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --clear-container-command
          Removes command from container declaration.

          Cannot be used in the same command with --container-command.

       --container-command=CONTAINER_COMMAND
          Sets command in the declaration to the specified value. Empty string
          is not allowed.

          Cannot be used in the same command with --clear-container-command.

     --container-env=[KEY=VALUE, ...,...]
        Update environment variables KEY with value VALUE passed to container.
        * Sets KEY to the specified value.
        * Adds KEY = VALUE, if KEY is not yet declared.
        * Only the last value of KEY is taken when KEY is repeated more
    than once.

    Values, declared with --container-env flag override those with the same KEY
    from file, provided in --container-env-file.

     --container-env-file=CONTAINER_ENV_FILE
        Update environment variables from a file. Same update rules as for
        --container-env apply. Values, declared with --container-env flag
        override those with the same KEY from file.

        File with environment variables declarations in format used by docker
        (almost). This means:
        * Lines are in format KEY=VALUE
        * Values must contain equality signs.
        * Variables without values are not supported (this is different from
    docker format).
      o If # is first non-whitespace character in a line the line is ignored
    as a comment.

     --remove-container-env=[KEY,...]
        Removes environment variables KEY from container declaration Does
        nothing, if a variable is not present.

     --container-mount-host-path=[host-path=HOSTPATH,mount-path=MOUNTPATH[,mode=MODE],...]
        Mounts a volume by using host-path.
        * Adds a volume, if mount-path is not yet declared.
        * Replaces a volume, if mount-path is declared.
    All parameters (host-path, mount-path, mode) are completely replaced.

         host-path
            Path on host to mount from.

         mount-path
            Path on container to mount to. Mount paths with spaces and commas
            (and other special characters) are not supported by this command.

         mode
            Volume mount mode: rw (read/write) or ro (read-only).

            Default: rw.

     --container-mount-tmpfs=[mount-path=MOUNTPATH,...]
        Mounts empty tmpfs into container at MOUNTPATH.

         mount-path
            Path on container to mount to. Mount paths with spaces and commas
            (and other special characters) are not supported by this command.

     --remove-container-mounts=[MOUNTPATH[,MOUNTPATH,...],...]
        Removes volume mounts (host-path, tmpfs, disk) with mountPath:
        MOUNTPATH from container declaration.

        Does nothing, if a volume mount is not declared.

EXAMPLES
    To run the gcr.io/google-containers/busybox image on an instance named
    'instance-1' that executes 'echo "Hello world"' as a run command, run:

        $ gcloud compute instances update-container instance-1         \
            --container-image=gcr.io/google-containers/busybox         \
            --container-command='echo "Hello world"'

    To run the gcr.io/google-containers/busybox image in privileged mode, run:

        $ gcloud compute instances update-container instance-1         \
            --container-image=gcr.io/google-containers/busybox         \
            --container-privileged

NOTES
    These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instances update-container
        $ gcloud beta compute instances update-container
