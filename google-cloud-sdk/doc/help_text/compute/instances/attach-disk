NAME
    gcloud compute instances attach-disk - attach a disk to an instance

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute instances attach-disk INSTANCE_NAME --disk=DISK
        [--csek-key-file=FILE] [--device-name=DEVICE_NAME]
        [--mode=MODE; default="rw"] [--zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute instances attach-disk is used to attach a disk to an
    instance. For example,

        $ gcloud compute instances attach-disk example-instance \
            --disk DISK --zone us-central1-a

    attaches the disk named 'DISK' to the instance named 'example-instance' in
    zone us-central1-a.

    After you create and attach a new disk to an instance, you must format and
    mount
    (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/add-persistent-disk#formatting)
    the disk so that the operating system can use the available storage space.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAME
        The name of the instance to operate on.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --disk=DISK
        The name of the disk to attach to the instance.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --csek-key-file=FILE
        Path to a Customer-Supplied Encryption Key (CSEK) key file, mapping
        Google Compute Engine resources to user managed keys to be used when
        creating, mounting, or snapshotting disks.

        If you pass - as value of the flag the CSEK will be read from stdin.
        See
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-supplied-encryption
        for more details.

     --device-name=DEVICE_NAME
        An optional name that indicates the disk name the guest operating
        system will see. (Note: Device name does not correspond to mounted
        volume name)

     --mode=MODE; default="rw"
        Specifies the mode of the disk. MODE must be one of:

         ro
            Read-only.
         rw
            Read-write. It is an error to attach a disk in read-write mode to
            more than one instance.

     --zone=ZONE
        The zone of the instance to operate on. If not specified, you may be
        prompted to select a zone. gcloud will attempt to identify the zone by
        searching for resources in your project. If the zone cannot be
        determined, you will then be prompted with all Google Cloud Platform
        zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instances attach-disk
        $ gcloud beta compute instances attach-disk
