NAME
    gcloud compute instances move - move an instance and its attached
        persistent disks between zones

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute instances move INSTANCE_NAME
        --destination-zone=DESTINATION_ZONE [--async] [--zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute instances move facilitates moving a Google Compute Engine
    virtual machine from one zone to another. Moving a virtual machine may
    incur downtime if the guest OS must be shutdown in order to quiesce disk
    volumes prior to snapshotting.

    For example, running:

        $ gcloud compute instances move example-instance-1 \
           --zone us-central1-b --destination-zone us-central1-f

    will move the instance called example-instance-1 with its all attached
    persistent disks, currently running in us-central1-b, to us-central1-f.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAME
        Name of the instance to operate on.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --destination-zone=DESTINATION_ZONE
        The zone to move the instance to.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Display information about the operation in progress, without waiting
        for the operation to complete.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the instance to operate on. If not specified, you may be
        prompted to select a zone. gcloud will attempt to identify the zone by
        searching for resources in your project. If the zone cannot be
        determined, you will then be prompted with all Google Cloud Platform
        zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instances move
        $ gcloud beta compute instances move
