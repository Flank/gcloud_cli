NAME
    gcloud compute target-https-proxies create - create a target HTTPS proxy

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute target-https-proxies create NAME
        --ssl-certificates=SSL_CERTIFICATE,[SSL_CERTIFICATE,...]
        --url-map=URL_MAP [--description=DESCRIPTION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute target-https-proxies create is used to create target HTTPS
    proxies. A target HTTPS proxy is referenced by one or more forwarding rules
    which define which packets the proxy is responsible for routing. The target
    HTTPS proxy points to a URL map that defines the rules for routing the
    requests. The URL map's job is to map URLs to backend services which handle
    the actual requests. The target HTTPS proxy also points to at most 10 SSL
    certificates used for server-side authentication.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        The name of the target HTTPS proxy to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --ssl-certificates=SSL_CERTIFICATE,[SSL_CERTIFICATE,...]
        References to at most 10 SSL certificate resources that are used for
        server-side authentication. The first SSL certificate in this list is
        considered the primary SSL certificate associated with the load
        balancer. The SSL certificate must exist and cannot be deleted while
        referenced by a target HTTPS proxy.

     --url-map=URL_MAP
        A reference to a URL map resource that defines the mapping of URLs to
        backend services. The URL map must exist and cannot be deleted while
        referenced by a target HTTPS proxy.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional, textual description for the target HTTPS proxy.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.
