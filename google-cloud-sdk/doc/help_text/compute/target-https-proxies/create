NAME
    gcloud compute target-https-proxies create - create a target HTTPS proxy

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute target-https-proxies create NAME
        --ssl-certificates=SSL_CERTIFICATE,[...] --url-map=URL_MAP
        [--description=DESCRIPTION]
        [--quic-override=QUIC_OVERRIDE; default="NONE"]
        [--ssl-policy=SSL_POLICY] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute target-https-proxies create is used to create target HTTPS
    proxies. A target HTTPS proxy is referenced by one or more forwarding rules
    which define which packets the proxy is responsible for routing. The target
    HTTPS proxy points to a URL map that defines the rules for routing the
    requests. The URL map's job is to map URLs to backend services which handle
    the actual requests. The target HTTPS proxy also points to at most 10 SSL
    certificates used for server-side authentication. The target HTTPS proxy
    can be associated with at most one SSL policy.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the target HTTPS proxy to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --ssl-certificates=SSL_CERTIFICATE,[...]
        References to at most 10 SSL certificate resources that are used for
        server-side authentication. The first SSL certificate in this list is
        considered the primary SSL certificate associated with the load
        balancer. The SSL certificate must exist and cannot be deleted while
        referenced by a target HTTPS proxy.

     --url-map=URL_MAP
        A reference to a URL map resource that defines the mapping of URLs to
        backend services. The URL map must exist and cannot be deleted while
        referenced by a target HTTPS proxy.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional, textual description for the target HTTPS proxy.

     --quic-override=QUIC_OVERRIDE; default="NONE"
        Controls whether load balancer may negotiate QUIC with clients. QUIC is
        a new transport which reduces latency compared to that of TCP. See
        https://www.chromium.org/quic for more details. QUIC_OVERRIDE must be
        one of:

         DISABLE
            Disallows load balancer to negotiate QUIC with clients.
         ENABLE
            Allows load balancer to negotiate QUIC with clients.
         NONE
            Allows Google to control when QUIC is rolled out.

     --ssl-policy=SSL_POLICY
        A reference to an SSL policy resource that defines the server-side
        support for SSL features and affects the connections between clients
        and the HTTPS proxy load balancer. The SSL policy must exist and cannot
        be deleted while referenced by a target HTTPS proxy.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud alpha compute target-https-proxies create
        $ gcloud beta compute target-https-proxies create
