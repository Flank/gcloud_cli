NAME
    gcloud compute target-https-proxies update - update a target HTTPS proxy

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute target-https-proxies update NAME
        [--ssl-certificates=SSL_CERTIFICATE,[SSL_CERTIFICATE,...]]
        [--url-map=URL_MAP] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute target-https-proxies update is used to change the SSL
    certificate and/or URL map of existing target HTTPS proxies. A target HTTPS
    proxy is referenced by one or more forwarding rules which define which
    packets the proxy is responsible for routing. The target HTTPS proxy in
    turn points to a URL map that defines the rules for routing the requests.
    The URL map's job is to map URLs to backend services which handle the
    actual requests. The target HTTPS proxy also points to at most 10 SSL
    certificates used for server-side authentication.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        The name of the target HTTPS proxy to update.

FLAGS
     --ssl-certificates=SSL_CERTIFICATE,[SSL_CERTIFICATE,...]
        References to at most 10 SSL certificate resources that are used for
        server-side authentication. The first SSL certificate in this list is
        considered the primary SSL certificate associated with the load
        balancer. The SSL certificate must exist and cannot be deleted while
        referenced by a target HTTPS proxy.

     --url-map=URL_MAP
        A reference to a URL map resource that defines the mapping of URLs to
        backend services. The URL map must exist and cannot be deleted while
        referenced by a target HTTPS proxy.
