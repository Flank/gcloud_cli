SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute networks update NAME
        [--bgp-routing-mode=MODE | --switch-to-custom-subnet-mode]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute networks update is used to update Google Compute Engine
    networks.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the network to operate on.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --bgp-routing-mode=MODE
          The target BGP routing mode for this network. MODE must be one of:

           global
              Cloud Routers in this network advertise subnetworks from all
              regions to their BGP peers, and program instances in all regions
              with the router's best learned BGP routes.
           regional
              Cloud Routers in this network advertise subnetworks from their
              local region only to their BGP peers, and program instances in
              their local region only with the router's best learned BGP
              routes.

       --switch-to-custom-subnet-mode
          Switch to custom subnet mode. This action cannot be undone.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.
