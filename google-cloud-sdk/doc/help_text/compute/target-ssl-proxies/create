SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute target-ssl-proxies create NAME
        --backend-service=BACKEND_SERVICE

        [--description=DESCRIPTION]
        [--proxy-header=PROXY_HEADER; default="NONE"] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute target-ssl-proxies create is used to create target SSL
    proxies. A target SSL proxy is referenced by one or more forwarding rules
    which define which packets the proxy is responsible for routing. The target
    SSL proxy points to a backend service which handle the actual requests. The
    target SSL proxy also points to at most 10 SSL certificates used for
    server-side authentication.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        The name of the target SSL proxy to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --backend-service=BACKEND_SERVICE
        A backend service that will be used for connections to the target SSL
        proxy.

     --ssl-certificates=SSL_CERTIFICATE,[SSL_CERTIFICATE,...]
        References to at most 10 SSL certificate resources that are used for
        server-side authentication. The first SSL certificate in this list is
        considered the primary SSL certificate associated with the load
        balancer. The SSL certificate must exist and cannot be deleted while
        referenced by a target SSL proxy.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional, textual description for the target SSL proxy.

     --proxy-header=PROXY_HEADER; default="NONE"
