NAME
    gcloud compute project-info set-usage-bucket - set the usage reporting
        bucket for a project

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute project-info set-usage-bucket
        (--bucket=BUCKET | --no-bucket) [--prefix=PREFIX]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute project-info set-usage-bucket is used to configure usage
    reporting for projects.

    Setting usage reporting will cause a log of usage per resource to be
    written to a specified Google Cloud Storage bucket daily. For example,

        $ gcloud compute project-info set-usage-bucket \
            --bucket gs://my-bucket

    will cause logs of the form usage_gce_YYYYMMDD.csv to be written daily to
    the bucket my-bucket. To disable this feature, issue the command:

        $ gcloud compute project-info set-usage-bucket --no-bucket

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --bucket=BUCKET
          The URI of a Google Cloud Storage bucket where the usage report
          object should be stored. The Google Service Account for performing
          usage reporting is granted write access to this bucket. The user
          running this command must be an owner of the bucket.

          To clear the usage bucket, use --no-bucket.

       --no-bucket
          Unsets the bucket. This disables usage report storage.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --prefix=PREFIX
        An optional prefix for the name of the usage report object stored in
        the bucket. If not supplied, then this defaults to usage. The report is
        stored as a CSV file named PREFIX_gce_YYYYMMDD.csv where YYYYMMDD is
        the day of the usage according to Pacific Time. The prefix should
        conform to Google Cloud Storage object naming conventions. This flag
        must not be provided when clearing the usage bucket.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud alpha compute project-info set-usage-bucket
        $ gcloud beta compute project-info set-usage-bucket
