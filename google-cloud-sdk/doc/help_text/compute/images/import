NAME
    gcloud compute images import - import an image into Compute Engine

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute images import IMAGE_NAME (--data-disk | --os=OS)
        (--source-file=SOURCE_FILE | --source-image=SOURCE_IMAGE) [--async]
        [--no-guest-environment] [--log-location=LOG_LOCATION]
        [--network=NETWORK] [--subnet=SUBNET] [--timeout=TIMEOUT; default="2h"]
        [--zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute images import imports Virtual Disk images, such as VMWare
    VMDK files and VHD files, into Compute Engine.

    Importing images involves three steps:
      o Upload the virtual disk file to Cloud Storage.
      o Import the image to Compute Engine.
      o Translate the image to make a bootable image.
    This command performs all three of these steps as required, depending on
    the input arguments specified.

    This command uses the --os flag to choose the appropriate translation. You
    can omit the translation step using the --data-disk flag.

    If you exported your disk from Compute Engine then you don't need to
    re-import it. Instead, use gcloud compute images create to create more
    images from the disk.

    Files stored on Cloud Storage and images in Compute Engine incur charges.
    See
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/importing-virtual-disks#resource_cleanup.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     IMAGE_NAME
        Name of the disk image to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --data-disk
          Specifies that the disk has no bootable OS installed on it. Imports
          the disk without making it bootable or installing Google tools on it.

       --os=OS
          Specifies the OS of the disk image being imported. OS must be one of:
          centos-6, centos-7, debian-8, debian-9, rhel-6, rhel-6-byol, rhel-7,
          rhel-7-byol, ubuntu-1404, ubuntu-1604, windows-10-byol,
          windows-2008r2, windows-2008r2-byol, windows-2012, windows-2012-byol,
          windows-2012r2, windows-2012r2-byol, windows-2016, windows-2016-byol,
          windows-2019, windows-2019-byol, windows-7-byol,
          windows-8-1-x64-byol.

     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --source-file=SOURCE_FILE
          A local file, or the Cloud Storage URI of the virtual disk file to
          import. For example: gs://my-bucket/my-image.vmdk or
          ./my-local-image.vmdk

       --source-image=SOURCE_IMAGE
          An existing Compute Engine image from which to import.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --guest-environment
        Installs the guest environment on the image. See
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/guest-environment. Enabled
        by default, use --no-guest-environment to disable.

     --log-location=LOG_LOCATION
        Directory in Cloud Storage to hold build logs. If not set,
        gs://<project num>.cloudbuild-logs.googleusercontent.com/ is created
        and used.

     --network=NETWORK
        Name of the network in your project to use for the image import. The
        network must have access to Cloud Storage. If not specified, the
        network named default is used.

     --subnet=SUBNET
        Name of the subnetwork in your project to use for the image import. If
        the network resource is in legacy mode, do not provide this property.
        If the network is in auto subnet mode, providing the subnetwork is
        optional. If the network is in custom subnet mode, then this field
        should be specified. Region or zone should be specified if this field
        is specified.

     --timeout=TIMEOUT; default="2h"
        Maximum time a build can last before it fails as "TIMEOUT". For
        example, specifying 2h fails the process after 2 hours. See $ gcloud
        topic datetimes for information about duration formats.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the image to import. The zone in which to do the work of
        importing the image. Overrides the default compute/zone property value
        for this command invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

EXAMPLES
    To import a centos-7 VMDK file, run:

        $ gcloud compute images import myimage-name --os=centos-7 \
            --source-file=mysourcefile

    To import a data disk without operating system, run:

        $ gcloud compute images import myimage-name --data-disk \
            --source-file=mysourcefile

NOTES
    These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud alpha compute images import
        $ gcloud beta compute images import
