NAME
    gcloud compute images import - import an image into Google Compute Engine

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute images import IMAGE_NAME (--data-disk | --os=OS)
        (--source-file=SOURCE_FILE | --source-image=SOURCE_IMAGE) [--async]
        [--log-location=LOG_LOCATION] [--timeout=TIMEOUT; default="2h"]
        [--zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute images import imports Virtual Disk images, such as VMWare
    VMDK files and VHD files, into Google Compute Engine.

    Importing images involves 3 steps:
      o Upload the virtual disk file to Google Cloud Storage.
      o Import the image to Google Compute Engine.
      o Translate the image to make a bootable image.
    This command will perform all three of these steps as necessary, depending
    on the input arguments specified by the user.

    This command uses the --os flag to choose the appropriate translation. You
    can omit the translation step using the --data-disk flag.

    If you exported your disk from Google Compute Engine then you do not need
    to re-import it. Instead, use the create command to create further images
    from it.

    Files stored on Cloud Storage and images in Compute Engine incur charges.
    See
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/importing-virtual-disks#resource_cleanup.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     IMAGE_NAME
        Name of the disk image to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --data-disk
          Specifies that the disk has no bootable OS installed on it. Imports
          the disk without making it bootable or installing Google tools on it.

       --os=OS
          Specifies the OS of the image being imported. OS must be one of:
          centos-6, centos-7, debian-8, debian-9, rhel-6, rhel-6-byol, rhel-7,
          rhel-7-byol, ubuntu-1404, ubuntu-1604, windows-2008r2,
          windows-2012r2, windows-2016.

     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --source-file=SOURCE_FILE
          A local file, or the Google Cloud Storage URI of the virtual disk
          file to import. For example: gs://my-bucket/my-image.vmdk or
          ./my-local-image.vmdk

       --source-image=SOURCE_IMAGE
          An existing Compute Engine image from which to import.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Display information about the operation in progress, without waiting
        for the operation to complete.

     --log-location=LOG_LOCATION
        Directory in Google Cloud Storage to hold build logs. If not set,
        gs://<project num>.cloudbuild-logs.googleusercontent.com/ will be
        created and used.

     --timeout=TIMEOUT; default="2h"
        Maximum time a build can last before it is failed as "TIMEOUT". For
        example, specifying 2h will fail the process after 2 hours. See $
        gcloud topic datetimes for information on duration formats.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the image to import. The zone in which to do the work of
        importing the image. Overrides the default compute/zone property value
        for this command invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

NOTES
    These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud alpha compute images import
        $ gcloud beta compute images import
