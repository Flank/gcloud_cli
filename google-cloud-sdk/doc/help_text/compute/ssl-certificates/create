NAME
    gcloud compute ssl-certificates create - create a Compute Engine SSL
        certificate

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute ssl-certificates create NAME
        (--domains=DOMAIN,[DOMAIN,...]
          | --certificate=LOCAL_FILE_PATH --private-key=LOCAL_FILE_PATH)
        [--description=DESCRIPTION] [--global | --region=REGION]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute ssl-certificates create creates SSL certificates, which you
    can use in a target HTTPS or target SSL proxy. An SSL certificate resource
    consists of a certificate and private key. The private key is encrypted
    before it is stored.

    You can create either a managed or a self-managed SslCertificate. A managed
    SslCertificate will be provisioned and renewed for you, when you specify
    the --domains flag. A self-managed certificate is created by passing the
    certificate obtained from Certificate Authority through --certificate and
    --private-key flags.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the SSL certificate to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Flags for managed or self-managed certificate. Exactly one of these must
     be specified:

       --domains=DOMAIN,[DOMAIN,...]
          List of domains to create a managed certificate for.

       Flags for self-managed certificate

         --certificate=LOCAL_FILE_PATH
            Path to a local certificate file to create a self-managed
            certificate. The certificate must be in PEM format. The certificate
            chain must be no greater than 5 certs long. The chain must include
            at least one intermediate cert. This flag must be specified if any
            of the other arguments in this group are specified.

         --private-key=LOCAL_FILE_PATH
            Path to a local private key file. The private key must be in PEM
            format and must use RSA or ECDSA encryption. This flag must be
            specified if any of the other arguments in this group are
            specified.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional, textual description for the SSL certificate.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --global
          If set, the SSL certificate is global.

       --region=REGION
          Region of the SSL certificate to create. If not specified, you may be
          prompted to select a region.

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/region property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/region

          Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To create a certificate 'my-cert' from a certificate placed under path
    'foo/cert' and a private key placed under path 'foo/pk', run:

        $ gcloud compute ssl-certificates create my-cert \
          --certificate=foo/cert --private-key=foo/pk

NOTES
    These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud alpha compute ssl-certificates create
        $ gcloud beta compute ssl-certificates create
