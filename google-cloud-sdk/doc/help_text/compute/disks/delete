NAME
    gcloud compute disks delete - delete Google Compute Engine persistent disks

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute disks delete DISK_NAME [DISK_NAME ...] [--zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute disks delete deletes one or more Google Compute Engine
    persistent disks. Disks can be deleted only if they are not being used by
    any virtual machine instances.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     DISK_NAME [DISK_NAME ...]
        Names of the disks to delete.

FLAGS
     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the disks to delete. If not specified and the compute/zone
        property isn't set, you may be prompted to select a zone.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud alpha compute disks delete
        $ gcloud beta compute disks delete
