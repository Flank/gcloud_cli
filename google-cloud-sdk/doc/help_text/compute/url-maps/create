NAME
    gcloud compute url-maps create - create a URL map

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute url-maps create URL_MAP_NAME
        (--default-backend-bucket=DEFAULT_BACKEND_BUCKET
          | --default-service=DEFAULT_SERVICE) [--description=DESCRIPTION]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute url-maps create is used to create URL maps which map HTTP
    and HTTPS request URLs to backend services and backend buckets. Mappings
    are done using a longest-match strategy.

    There are two components to a mapping: a host rule and a path matcher. A
    host rule maps one or more hosts to a path matcher. A path matcher maps
    request paths to backend services or backend buckets. For example, a host
    rule can map the hosts .google.com and google.com to a path matcher called
    www. The www path matcher in turn can map the path /search/ to the search
    backend service, the path /static/ to the static backend bucket and
    everything else to a default backend service or default backend bucket.

    Host rules and patch matchers can be added to the URL map after the map is
    created by using gcloud compute url-maps edit or by using gcloud compute
    url-maps add-path-matcher and gcloud compute url-maps add-host-rule.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     URL_MAP_NAME
        Name of the URL map to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --default-backend-bucket=DEFAULT_BACKEND_BUCKET
          A backend bucket that will be used for requests for which this URL
          map has no mappings. Exactly one of --default-service or
          --default-backend-bucket is required.

       --default-service=DEFAULT_SERVICE
          A backend service that will be used for requests for which this URL
          map has no mappings. Exactly one of --default-service or
          --default-backend-bucket is required.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional, textual description for the URL map.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.
