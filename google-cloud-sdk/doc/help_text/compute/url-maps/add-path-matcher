NAME
    gcloud compute url-maps add-path-matcher - add a path matcher to a URL map

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute url-maps add-path-matcher URL_MAP_NAME
        --path-matcher-name=PATH_MATCHER_NAME
        (--default-backend-bucket=DEFAULT_BACKEND_BUCKET
          | --default-service=DEFAULT_SERVICE)
        [--backend-bucket-path-rules=PATH=BUCKET,[PATH=BUCKET,...]]
        [--backend-service-path-rules=PATH=SERVICE,[...]]
        [--delete-orphaned-path-matcher] [--description=DESCRIPTION]
        [--path-rules=PATH=SERVICE,[...]]
        [--existing-host=EXISTING_HOST | --new-hosts=NEW_HOST,[NEW_HOST,...]]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute url-maps add-path-matcher is used to add a path matcher to a
    URL map. A path matcher maps HTTP request paths to backend services or
    backend buckets. Each path matcher must be referenced by at least one host
    rule. This command can create a new host rule through the --new-hosts flag
    or it can reconfigure an existing host rule to point to the newly added
    path matcher using --existing-host. In the latter case, if a path matcher
    is orphaned as a result of the operation, this command will fail unless
    --delete-orphaned-path-matcher is provided.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     URL_MAP_NAME
        The name of the URL map to operate on.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --path-matcher-name=PATH_MATCHER_NAME
        The name to assign to the path matcher.

     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --default-backend-bucket=DEFAULT_BACKEND_BUCKET
          A backend bucket that will be used for requests that the path matcher
          cannot match. Exactly one of --default-service or
          --default-backend-bucket is required.

       --default-service=DEFAULT_SERVICE
          A backend service that will be used for requests that the path
          matcher cannot match. Exactly one of --default-service or
          --default-backend-bucket is required.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --backend-bucket-path-rules=PATH=BUCKET,[PATH=BUCKET,...]
        Rules for mapping request paths to backend buckets.

     --backend-service-path-rules=PATH=SERVICE,[...]
        Rules for mapping request paths to services.

     --delete-orphaned-path-matcher
        If provided and a path matcher is orphaned as a result of this command,
        the command removes the orphaned path matcher instead of failing.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional, textual description for the path matcher.

     --path-rules=PATH=SERVICE,[...]
        Rules for mapping request paths to services.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --existing-host=EXISTING_HOST
          An existing host rule to tie the new path matcher to. Although host
          rules can contain more than one host, only a single host is needed to
          uniquely identify the host rule.

       --new-hosts=NEW_HOST,[NEW_HOST,...]
          If specified, a new host rule with the given hosts is created and the
          path matcher is tied to the new host rule.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To create a rule for mapping the path /search/* to the hypothetical
    search-service, /static/* to the static-bucket backend bucket and /images/*
    to the images-service under the hosts example.com and *.example.com, run:

        $ gcloud compute url-maps add-path-matcher MY-URL-MAP \
            --path-matcher-name MY-MATCHER \
            --default-service MY-DEFAULT-SERVICE \
            --backend-service-path-rules \
            '/search/*=search_service,/images/*=images-service' \
            --backend-bucket-path-rules '/static/*=static-bucket' \
            --new-hosts example.com '*.example.com'

    Note that a default service or default backend bucket must be provided to
    handle paths for which there is no mapping.

NOTES
    These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud alpha compute url-maps add-path-matcher
        $ gcloud beta compute url-maps add-path-matcher
