SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute instance-groups managed resize NAME --size=SIZE
        [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute instance-groups managed resize resize a managed instance
    group to a provided size.

    If you resize down, the Instance Group Manager service deletes instances
    from the group until the group reaches the desired size. To understand in
    what order instances will be deleted, see the API documentation.

    If you resize up, the service adds instances to the group using the current
    instance template until the group reaches the desired size.
