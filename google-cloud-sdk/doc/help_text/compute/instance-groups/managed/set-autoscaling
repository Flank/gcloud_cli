DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute instance-groups managed set-autoscaling sets autoscaling
    parameters of specified managed instance group.

    Autoscalers can use one or more policies listed below. Information on using
    multiple policies can be found here:
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/autoscaler/multiple-policies

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the managed instance group to operate on.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --max-num-replicas=MAX_NUM_REPLICAS
        Maximum number of replicas Autoscaler will set.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --cool-down-period=COOL_DOWN_PERIOD
        The time period that the autoscaler should wait before it starts
        collecting information from a new instance. This prevents the
        autoscaler from collecting information when the instance is
        initializing, during which the collected usage would not be reliable.
        The default is 60s. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on
        duration formats.

     --custom-metric-utilization=[metric=METRIC],[utilization-target=UTILIZATION-TARGET],[utilization-target-type=UTILIZATION-TARGET-TYPE]
        Adds a target metric value for the Autoscaler to use.

         metric
            Protocol-free URL of a Google Cloud Monitoring metric.

         utilization-target
            Value of the metric Autoscaler will aim to maintain (greater than
            0.0).

         utilization-target-type
            How target is expressed. Valid values: DELTA_PER_MINUTE,
            DELTA_PER_SECOND, GAUGE.
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Notes about Autoscaler.

     --min-num-replicas=MIN_NUM_REPLICAS
        Minimum number of replicas Autoscaler will set.

     --mode=MODE
        Set the mode of an autoscaler for a managed instance group.

        You can turn off or restrict MIG autoscaler activities without
        affecting your autoscaler configuration. The autoscaler configuration
        persists while the activities are turned off or restricted, and the
        activities resume when the autoscaler is turned on again or when the
        restrictions are lifted.

        MODE must be one of:

         off
            Turns off autoscaling, while keeping the new configuration.
         on
            Permits autoscaling to scale out and in (default for new
            autoscalers).
         only-scale-out
            Permits autoscaling to scale only out and not in.
         only-up
            (DEPRECATED) Permits autoscaling to scale only out and not in.

                Value `only-up` is deprecated. Use `--mode only-scale-out`
                instead.

     --scale-based-on-cpu
        Autoscaler will be based on CPU utilization.

     --scale-based-on-load-balancing
        Use autoscaling based on load balancing utilization.

     --scale-in-control=[max-scaled-in-replicas=MAX-SCALED-IN-REPLICAS],[max-scaled-in-replicas-percent=MAX-SCALED-IN-REPLICAS-PERCENT],[time-window=TIME-WINDOW]
        Configuration that allows slower scale in so that even if Autoscaler
        recommends an abrupt scale in of a managed instance group, it will be
        throttled as specified by the parameters.

         max-scaled-in-replicas
            Maximum allowed number of VMs that can be deducted from the peak
            recommendation during the window. Possibly all these VMs can be
            deleted at once so the application needs to be prepared to lose
            that many VMs in one step. Mutually exclusive with
            'max-scaled-in-replicas-percent'.

         max-scaled-in-replicas-percent
            Maximum allowed percent of VMs that can be deducted from the peak
            recommendation during the window. Possibly all these VMs can be
            deleted at once so the application needs to be prepared to lose
            that many VMs in one step. Mutually exclusive with
            'max-scaled-in-replicas'.

         time-window
            How long back autoscaling should look when computing
            recommendations. The autoscaler will not resize below the maximum
            allowed deduction subtracted from the peak size observed in this
            period. Measured in seconds.

     --target-cpu-utilization=TARGET_CPU_UTILIZATION
        Autoscaler will aim to maintain CPU utilization at target level (0.0 to
        1.0).

     --target-load-balancing-utilization=TARGET_LOAD_BALANCING_UTILIZATION
        Autoscaler will aim to maintain the load balancing utilization level
        (greater than 0.0).

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified,
          you may be prompted to select a region.

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified,
          you may be prompted to select a zone.

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
          invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
