NAME
    gcloud compute instance-groups managed update-autoscaling - update
        autoscaling parameters of a managed instance group

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute instance-groups managed update-autoscaling NAME
        [--mode=MODE] [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute instance-groups managed update-autoscaling updates
    autoscaling parameters of specified managed instance group.

    Autoscalers can use one or more policies listed below. Information on using
    multiple policies can be found here:
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/autoscaler/multiple-policies

    In contrast to gcloud compute instance-groups managed set-autoscaling, this
    command only updates specified fields. For instance:

        $ gcloud compute instance-groups managed update-autoscaling \
          --mode only-scale-out

    would change the mode field of the autoscaler policy, but leave the rest of
    the settings intact.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the managed instance group to operate on.

FLAGS
     --mode=MODE
        Set the mode of an autoscaler for a managed instance group.

        You can turn off or restrict MIG autoscaler activities without
        affecting your autoscaler configuration. The autoscaler configuration
        persists while the activities are turned off or restricted, and the
        activities resume when the autoscaler is turned on again or when the
        restrictions are lifted.

        MODE must be one of:

         off
            Turns off autoscaling, while keeping the new configuration.
         on
            Permits autoscaling to scale out and in (default for new
            autoscalers).
         only-scale-out
            Permits autoscaling to scale only out and not in.
         only-up
            (DEPRECATED) Permits autoscaling to scale only out and not in.

                Value `only-up` is deprecated. Use `--mode only-scale-out`
                instead.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified,
          you may be prompted to select a region.

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified,
          you may be prompted to select a zone.

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
          invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To update an existing instance group:

        $ gcloud compute instance-groups managed update-autoscaling \
          --mode=only-scale-out

NOTES
    These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed update-autoscaling
        $ gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed update-autoscaling
