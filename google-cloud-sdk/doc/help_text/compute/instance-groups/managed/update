    gcloud compute instance-groups managed update - update Google Compute
        Engine managed instance groups

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute instance-groups managed update NAME
        [--instance-redistribution-type=TYPE]
        [--clear-autohealing
          | --initial-delay=INITIAL_DELAY --health-check=HEALTH_CHECK
          | --http-health-check=HTTP_HEALTH_CHECK
          | --https-health-check=HTTPS_HEALTH_CHECK]
        [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute instance-groups managed update allows you to specify or
    modify AutoHealingPolicy for an existing managed instance group.

    When updating the AutoHealingPolicy, you may specify the health check,
    initial delay, or both. If the field is unspecified, its value won't be
    modified. If --health-check is specified, the health check will be used to
    monitor the health of your application. Whenever the health check signal
    for the instance becomes UNHEALTHY, the autohealing action (RECREATE) on an
    instance will be performed.

    If no health check is specified, the instance autohealing will be triggered
    by the instance status only (i.e. the autohealing action (RECREATE) on an
    instance will be performed if instance.status is not RUNNING).

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the managed instance group to update.

FLAGS
     --instance-redistribution-type=TYPE
        Specifies the type of the instance redistribution policy. An instance
        redistribution type lets you enable or disable automatic instance
        redistribution across zones to meet the target distribution. The target
        distribution is a state of a regional managed instance group where all
        instances are spread out evenly across all target zones.

        An instance redistribution type can be specified only for a
        non-autoscaled regional managed instance group. By default it is set to
        PROACTIVE.

        The following types are available:

        * NONE - The managed instance group does not redistribute instances
          across zones.

        * PROACTIVE - The managed instance group proactively redistributes
          instances to meet its target distribution.

    TYPE must be one of: NONE, PROACTIVE.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --clear-autohealing
          Clears all autohealing policy fields for the managed instance group.

       --initial-delay=INITIAL_DELAY
          Specifies the length of time during which the instance is known to be
          initializing and should not be autohealed even if unhealthy. This
          value cannot be greater than 1 hour. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for
          information on duration formats.

       At most one of these may be specified:

         --health-check=HEALTH_CHECK
            Name of the health check to operate on.

         --http-health-check=HTTP_HEALTH_CHECK
            (DEPRECATED) HTTP health check object used for autohealing
            instances in this group.

            HttpHealthCheck is deprecated. Use --health-check instead.

         --https-health-check=HTTPS_HEALTH_CHECK
            (DEPRECATED) HTTPS health check object used for autohealing
            instances in this group.

            HttpsHealthCheck is deprecated. Use --health-check instead.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the managed instance group to update. If not specified, you
          may be prompted to select a region.

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the managed instance group to update. If not specified, you
          may be prompted to select a zone.

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
          invocation.
