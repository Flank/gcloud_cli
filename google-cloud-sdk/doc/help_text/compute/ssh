NAME
    gcloud compute ssh - SSH into a virtual machine instance

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute ssh [USER@]INSTANCE [--command=COMMAND]
        [--container=CONTAINER] [--dry-run] [--force-key-file-overwrite]
        [--internal-ip] [--plain] [--ssh-flag=SSH_FLAG]
        [--ssh-key-file=SSH_KEY_FILE]
        [--strict-host-key-checking=STRICT_HOST_KEY_CHECKING] [--zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...] [-- SSH_ARGS ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute ssh is a thin wrapper around the ssh(1) command that takes
    care of authentication and the translation of the instance name into an IP
    address.

    Note, this command does not work for Windows VMs. To connect to a Windows
    instance using a command-line method, refer to this guide:
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/connecting-to-instance#windows_cli

    The default network comes preconfigured to allow ssh access to all VMs. If
    the default network was edited, or if not using the default network, you
    may need to explicitly enable ssh access by adding a firewall-rule:

        $ gcloud compute firewall-rules create --network=NETWORK           \
              default-allow-ssh --allow tcp:22

    gcloud compute ssh ensures that the user's public SSH key is present in the
    project's metadata. If the user does not have a public SSH key, one is
    generated using ssh-keygen(1) (if the --quiet flag is given, the generated
    key will have an empty passphrase).

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     [USER@]INSTANCE
        Specifies the instance to SSH into.

        USER specifies the username with which to SSH. If omitted, $USER from
        the environment is selected.

        INSTANCE specifies the name of the virtual machine instance to SSH
        into.

     [-- SSH_ARGS ...]
        Flags and positionals passed to the underlying ssh implementation.

        The '--' argument must be specified between gcloud specific args on the
        left and SSH_ARGS on the right. Example:

            $ gcloud compute ssh example-instance --zone us-central1-a -- -vvv \
            -L 80:%INSTANCE%:80

FLAGS
     --command=COMMAND
        A command to run on the virtual machine.

        Runs the command on the target instance and then exits.

     --container=CONTAINER
        The name or ID of a container inside of the virtual machine instance to
        connect to. This only applies to virtual machines that are using a
        Google Container-Optimized virtual machine image. For more information,
        see https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/containers.

     --dry-run
        Print the equivalent scp/ssh command that would be run to stdout,
        instead of executing it.

     --force-key-file-overwrite
        If enabled, the gcloud command-line tool will regenerate and overwrite
        the files associated with a broken SSH key without asking for
        confirmation in both interactive and non-interactive environments.

        If disabled, the files associated with a broken SSH key will not be
        regenerated and will fail in both interactive and non-interactive
        environments.

     --internal-ip
        Connect to instances using their internal IP addresses rather than
        their external IP addresses. Use this to connect from one instance to
        another on the same VPC network, over a VPN connection, or between two
        peered VPC networks.

        For this connection to work, you must configure your networks and
        firewall to allow SSH connections to the internal IP address of the
        instance to which you want to connect.

        To learn how to use this flag, see
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/connecting-advanced#sshbetweeninstances.

     --plain
        Suppress the automatic addition of ssh(1)/scp(1) flags. This flag is
        useful if you want to take care of authentication yourself or use
        specific ssh/scp features.

     --ssh-flag=SSH_FLAG
        Additional flags to be passed to ssh(1). It is recommended that flags
        be passed using an assignment operator and quotes. This flag will
        replace occurences of %USER% and %INSTANCE% with their dereferenced
        values. Example:

            $ gcloud compute ssh example-instance --zone us-central1-a \
                --ssh-flag="-vvv" --ssh-flag="-L 80:%INSTANCE%:80"

        is equivalent to passing the flags --vvv and -L 80:162.222.181.197:80
        to ssh(1) if the external IP address of 'example-instance' is
        162.222.181.197.

     --ssh-key-file=SSH_KEY_FILE
        The path to the SSH key file. By default, this is
        ~/.ssh/google_compute_engine.

     --strict-host-key-checking=STRICT_HOST_KEY_CHECKING
        Override the default behavior of StrictHostKeyChecking for the
        connection. By default, StrictHostKeyChecking is set to 'no' the first
        time you connect to an instance, and will be set to 'yes' for all
        subsequent connections. STRICT_HOST_KEY_CHECKING must be one of: yes,
        no, ask.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the instance to connect to. If not specified and the
        compute/zone property isn't set, you may be prompted to select a zone.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To SSH into 'example-instance' in zone us-central1-a, run:

        $ gcloud compute ssh example-instance --zone us-central1-a

    You can also run a command on the virtual machine. For example, to get a
    snapshot of the guest's process tree, run:

        $ gcloud compute ssh example-instance --zone us-central1-a \
            --command "ps -ejH"

    If you are using the Google Container-Optimized virtual machine image, you
    can SSH into one of your containers with:

        $ gcloud compute ssh example-instance --zone us-central1-a \
            --container CONTAINER

NOTES
    These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud alpha compute ssh
        $ gcloud beta compute ssh
