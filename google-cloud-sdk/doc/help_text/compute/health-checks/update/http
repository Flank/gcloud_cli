DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute health-checks update http is used to update an existing HTTP
    health check. Only arguments passed in will be updated on the health check.
    Other attributes will remain unaffected.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the HTTP health check to update.

FLAGS
     --check-interval=CHECK_INTERVAL
        How often to perform a health check for an instance. For example,
        specifying 10s will run the check every 10 seconds. See $ gcloud topic
        datetimes for information on duration formats.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        A textual description for the HTTP health check. Pass in an empty
        string to unset.

     --healthy-threshold=HEALTHY_THRESHOLD
        The number of consecutive successful health checks before an unhealthy
        instance is marked as healthy.

     --host=HOST
        The value of the host header used in this HTTP health check request. By
        default, this is empty and Google Compute Engine automatically sets the
        host header in health requests to the same external IP address as the
        forwarding rule associated with the target pool. Setting this to an
        empty string will clear any existing host value.

     --proxy-header=PROXY_HEADER
        The type of proxy protocol header to be sent to the backend.
        PROXY_HEADER must be one of:

         NONE
            No proxy header is added.
         PROXY_V1
            Adds the header "PROXY UNKNOWN\r\n".

     --request-path=REQUEST_PATH
        The request path that this health check monitors. For example,
        /healthcheck.

     --response=RESPONSE
        When empty, status code of the response determines health. When not
        empty, presence of specified string in first 1024 characters of
        response body determines health. Only ASCII characters allowed.

     --timeout=TIMEOUT
        If Google Compute Engine doesn't receive a healthy response from the
        instance by the time specified by the value of this flag, the health
        check request is considered a failure. For example, specifying 10s will
        cause the check to wait for 10 seconds before considering the request a
        failure. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on duration
        formats.

     --unhealthy-threshold=UNHEALTHY_THRESHOLD
        The number of consecutive health check failures before a healthy
        instance is marked as unhealthy.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --global
          If set, the HTTP health check is global.

       --region=REGION
          Region of the HTTP health check to update. If not specified, you may
          be prompted to select a region.

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/region property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/region

          Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     These flags configure the port that the health check monitors. If both
     --port and --port-name are specified, --port takes precedence.

       --port=PORT
          The TCP port number that this health check monitors.

       --port-name=PORT_NAME
          The port name that this health check monitors. By default, this is
          empty. Setting this to an empty string will clear any existing
          port-name value.

       --use-serving-port
          If given, use the "serving port" for health checks:

          + When health checking network endpoints in a Network Endpoint
            Group, use the port specified with each endpoint.
          + When health checking other backends, use the port or named port
            of the backend service.
