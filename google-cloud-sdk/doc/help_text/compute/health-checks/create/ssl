NAME
    gcloud compute health-checks create ssl - create a SSL health check to
        monitor load balanced instances

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute health-checks create ssl NAME
        [--check-interval=CHECK_INTERVAL; default="5s"]
        [--description=DESCRIPTION]
        [--healthy-threshold=HEALTHY_THRESHOLD; default=2]
        [--proxy-header=PROXY_HEADER; default="NONE"] [--request=REQUEST]
        [--response=RESPONSE] [--timeout=TIMEOUT; default="5s"]
        [--unhealthy-threshold=UNHEALTHY_THRESHOLD; default=2]
        [--port=PORT; default=80 --port-name=PORT_NAME] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute health-checks create ssl is used to create a SSL health
    check. SSL health checks monitor instances in a load balancer controlled by
    a target pool. All arguments to the command are optional except for the
    name of the health check. For more information on load balancing, see
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing-and-autoscaling/

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the SSL health check to create.

FLAGS
     --check-interval=CHECK_INTERVAL; default="5s"
        How often to perform a health check for an instance. For example,
        specifying 10s will run the check every 10 seconds. The default value
        is 5s. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on duration
        formats.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional string description for the SSL health check.

     --healthy-threshold=HEALTHY_THRESHOLD; default=2
        The number of consecutive successful health checks before an unhealthy
        instance is marked as healthy. The default is 2.

     --proxy-header=PROXY_HEADER; default="NONE"
        The type of proxy protocol header to be sent to the backend.
        PROXY_HEADER must be one of:

         NONE
            No proxy header is added.
         PROXY_V1
            Adds the header "PROXY UNKNOWN\r\n".

     --request=REQUEST
        An optional string of up to 1024 characters to send once the health
        check TCP connection has been established. The health checker then
        looks for a reply of the string provided in the --response field.

        If --response is not configured, the health checker does not wait for a
        response and regards the probe as successful if the TCP or SSL
        handshake was successful.

     --response=RESPONSE
        An optional string of up to 1024 characters that the health checker
        expects to receive from the instance. If the response is not received
        exactly, the health check probe fails. If --response is configured, but
        not --request, the health checker will wait for a response anyway.
        Unless your system automatically sends out a message in response to a
        successful handshake, only configure --response to match an explicit
        --request.

     --timeout=TIMEOUT; default="5s"
        If Google Compute Engine doesn't receive a healthy response from the
        instance by the time specified by the value of this flag, the health
        check request is considered a failure. For example, specifying 10s will
        cause the check to wait for 10 seconds before considering the request a
        failure. The default value is 5s. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for
        information on duration formats.

     --unhealthy-threshold=UNHEALTHY_THRESHOLD; default=2
        The number of consecutive health check failures before a healthy
        instance is marked as unhealthy. The default is 2.

     These flags configure the port that the health check monitors. If none is
     specified, the default port of 80 is used; if both --port and --port-name
     are specified, --port takes precedence.

       --port=PORT; default=80
          The TCP port number that this health check monitors.

       --port-name=PORT_NAME
          The port name that this health check monitors. By default, this is
          empty.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.
