NAME
    gcloud compute target-http-proxies update - update a target HTTP proxy

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute target-http-proxies update NAME --url-map=URL_MAP
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute target-http-proxies update is used to change the URL map of
    existing target HTTP proxies. A target HTTP proxy is referenced by one or
    more forwarding rules which specify the network traffic that the proxy is
    responsible for routing. The target HTTP proxy points to a URL map that
    defines the rules for routing the requests. The URL map's job is to map
    URLs to backend services which handle the actual requests.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the target HTTP proxy to update.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --url-map=URL_MAP
        A reference to a URL map resource that defines the mapping of URLs to
        backend services. The URL map must exist and cannot be deleted while
        referenced by a target HTTP proxy.

    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
