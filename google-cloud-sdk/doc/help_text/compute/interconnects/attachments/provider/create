DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute interconnects attachments provider create is used to create
    partner provider interconnect attachments. An interconnect attachment binds
    the underlying connectivity of an Interconnect to a path into and out of
    the customer's cloud network. Partner provider attachments can only be
    created by approved network partners.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the interconnect attachment to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --bandwidth=BANDWIDTH
        Provisioned capacity of the attachment in bits/s. BANDWIDTH must be one
        of:

     --interconnect=INTERCONNECT
        The interconnect for the interconnect attachment

     --pairing-key=PAIRING_KEY
        Value of the pairing-key from the target partner attachment provided by
        the customer.

     Partner metadata. This must be specified.

       --partner-interconnect-name=PARTNER_INTERCONNECT_NAME
          Plain text name of the Interconnect this attachment is connected to,
          as displayed in the Partner's portal. For instance "Chicago 1". This
          flag must be specified if any of the other arguments in this group
          are specified.

       --partner-name=PARTNER_NAME
          Plain text name of the Partner providing this attachment. This value
          may be validated to match approved Partner values. This flag must be
          specified if any of the other arguments in this group are specified.

       --partner-portal-url=PARTNER_PORTAL_URL
          URL of the Partner's portal for this Attachment. The Partner may wish
          to customize this to be a deep-link to the specific resource on the
          Partner portal. This value may be validated to match approved Partner
          values. This flag must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --candidate-subnets=[SUBNET,...]
        Up to 16 candidate prefixes that can be used to restrict the allocation
        of cloudRouterIpAddress and customerRouterIpAddress for this
        attachment. All prefixes must be within link-local address space.
        Google will attempt to select an unused /29 from the supplied candidate
        subnet(s), or all of link-local space if no subnets supplied. Google
        will not re-use a /29 already in-use by your project, even if it's
        contained in one of the candidate subnets. The request will fail if all
        /29s within the candidate subnets are in use at Google's edge.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Human-readable plain-text description of attachment.

     --partner-asn=PARTNER_ASN
        BGP ASN of the partner. This should only be supplied by layer 3
        providers that have configured BGP on behalf of the customer.

     --region=REGION
        Region of the interconnect attachment to create. If not specified, you
        may be prompted to select a region.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     --vlan=VLAN
        Desired VLAN for this attachment, in the range 2-4094. If not supplied,
        Google will automatically select a VLAN.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is an internal implementation detail and may change or
    disappear without notice.
