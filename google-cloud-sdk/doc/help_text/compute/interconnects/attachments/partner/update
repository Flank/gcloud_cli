SYNOPSIS

        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute interconnects attachments partner update is used to update
    partner interconnect attachments. A partner interconnect attachment binds
    the underlying connectivity of a provider's Interconnect to a path into and
    out of the customer's cloud network.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the interconnect attachment to patch.

FLAGS
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Human-readable plain-text description of attachment.

     --enable-admin
        Administrative status of the interconnect attachment. When this is
        enabled, the attachment is operational and will carry traffic. Use
        --no-enable-admin to disable it.

     --region=REGION
        Region of the interconnect attachment to patch. If not specified, you
        may be prompted to select a region.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.
