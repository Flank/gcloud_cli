SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute interconnects attachments dedicated update NAME
        [--description=DESCRIPTION] [--enable-admin] [--region=REGION]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute interconnects attachments dedicated update is used to update
    interconnect attachments. An interconnect attachment is what binds the
    underlying connectivity of an interconnect to a path into and out of the
    customer's cloud network.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the interconnect attachment to patch.

FLAGS
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Human-readable plain-text description of attachment.

     --enable-admin
        Administrative status of the interconnect attachment. When this is
        enabled, the attachment is operational and will carry traffic. Use
        --no-enable-admin to disable it.

     --region=REGION
        Region of the interconnect attachment to patch. If not specified, you
        may be prompted to select a region.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.
