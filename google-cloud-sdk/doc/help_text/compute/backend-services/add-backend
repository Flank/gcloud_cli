DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute backend-services add-backend is used to add a backend to a
    backend service. A backend is a group of tasks that can handle requests
    sent to a backend service. Currently, the group of tasks can be one or more
    Google Compute Engine virtual machine instances grouped together using an
    instance group.

    Traffic is first spread evenly across all virtual machines in the group.
    When the group is full, traffic is sent to the next nearest group(s) that
    still have remaining capacity.

    To modify the parameters of a backend after it has been added to the
    backend service, use gcloud compute backend-services update-backend or
    gcloud compute backend-services edit.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME
        Name of the backend service to operate on.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --instance-group=INSTANCE_GROUP
        Name of the instance group to add to the backend service.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --balancing-mode=BALANCING_MODE
        Defines the strategy for balancing load. BALANCING_MODE must be one of:

         CONNECTION
            Spreads load based on how many concurrent connections the group can
            handle. There are two ways to specify max connections:
            --max-connections which defines the max number of connections for
            the whole group or --max-connections-per-instance, which defines
            the max number of connections on a per-instance basis. Available
            for all services.
         RATE
            Spreads load based on how many requests per second (RPS) the group
            can handle. There are two ways to specify max RPS: --max-rate which
            defines the max RPS for the whole group or --max-rate-per-instance,
            which defines the max RPS on a per-instance basis. Available only
            for HTTP-based protocols.
         UTILIZATION
            Relies on the CPU utilization of the instances in the group when
            balancing load. Use --max-utilization to set a maximum target CPU
            utilization for each instance. Use --max-rate-per-instance or
            --max-rate to optionally limit based on RPS in addition to CPU. You
            can optionally also limit based on connections (for TCP/SSL) in
            addition to CPU by setting --max-connections or
            --max-connections-per-instance. Available for all services without
            --load-balancing-scheme INTERNAL.

     --capacity-scaler=CAPACITY_SCALER
        A setting that applies to all balancing modes. This value is multiplied
        by the balancing mode value to set the current max usage of the
        instance group. Acceptable values are 0.0 (0%) through 1.0 (100%).
        Setting this value to 0.0 (0%) drains the backend service. Note that
        draining a backend service only prevents new connections to instances
        in the group. All existing connections are allowed to continue until
        they close by normal means.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional, textual description for the backend.

     --max-utilization=MAX_UTILIZATION
        The maximum average CPU utilization of the backend service. Acceptable
        values are 0.0 (0%) through 1.0 (100%). This flag can only be provided
        when the balancing mode is UTILIZATION.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --global
          If provided, it is assumed the backend service is global.

       --region=REGION
          The region of the backend service to operate on. Overrides the
          default compute/region property value for this command invocation.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --instance-group-region=INSTANCE_GROUP_REGION
          The region of the instance group to add to the backend service. If
          not specified, you may be prompted to select a region.

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/region property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/region

          Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

       --instance-group-zone=INSTANCE_GROUP_ZONE
          The zone of the instance group to add to the backend service. If not
          specified and the compute/zone property isn't set, you may be
          prompted to select a zone.

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/zone property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

          Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --max-connections=MAX_CONNECTIONS
          Maximum concurrent connections that the group can handle. Valid only
          for TCP/SSL connections.

       --max-connections-per-instance=MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_INSTANCE
          The maximum concurrent connections per instance. Valid only for
          TCP/SSL connections.

       --max-rate=MAX_RATE
          Maximum number of requests per second that can be sent to the
          instance group. Must not be used with Autoscaled Managed Instance
          Groups. --max-rate and --max-rate-per-instance are mutually
          exclusive. However, one of them can be set even if --balancing-mode
          is set to UTILIZATION. If either --max-rate or
          --max-rate-per-instance is set and --balancing-mode is set to RATE,
          then only that value is considered when judging capacity. If either
          --max-rate or --max-rate-per-instance is set and --balancing-mode is
          set to UTILIZATION, then instances are judged to be at capacity when
          either the UTILIZATION or RATE value is reached.

       --max-rate-per-instance=MAX_RATE_PER_INSTANCE
          Maximum number of requests per second that can be sent to each
          instance in the instance group. --max-rate and
          --max-rate-per-instance are mutually exclusive. However, one of them
          can be set even if --balancing-mode is set to UTILIZATION. If either
          --max-rate or --max-rate-per-instance is set and --balancing-mode is
          set to RATE, then only that value is considered when judging
          capacity. If either --max-rate or --max-rate-per-instance is set and
          --balancing-mode is set to UTILIZATION, then instances are judged to
          be at capacity when either the UTILIZATION or RATE value is reached.
