NAME
    gcloud compute connect-to-serial-port - connect to the serial port of an
        instance

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud compute connect-to-serial-port [USER@]INSTANCE [--dry-run]
        [--extra-args=KEY=VALUE,[KEY=VALUE,...]] [--force-key-file-overwrite]
        [--port=PORT; default=1] [--ssh-key-file=SSH_KEY_FILE] [--zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud compute connect-to-serial-port allows users to connect to, and
    interact with, a VM's virtual serial port using ssh as the secure,
    authenticated transport protocol.

    The user must first enable serial port access to a given VM by setting the
    'serial-port-enable=true' metadata key-value pair. Setting
    'serial-port-enable' on the project-level metadata enables serial port
    access to all VMs in the project.

    This command uses the same SSH key pair as the gcloud compute ssh command
    and also ensures that the user's public SSH key is present in the project's
    metadata. If the user does not have a public SSH key, one is generated
    using ssh-keygen.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     [USER@]INSTANCE
        Specifies the user/instance for the serial port connection.

        USER specifies the username to authenticate as. If omitted, the current
        OS user is selected.

FLAGS
     --dry-run
        If provided, the ssh command is printed to standard out rather than
        being executed.

     --extra-args=KEY=VALUE,[KEY=VALUE,...]
        Optional arguments can be passed to the serial port connection by
        passing key-value pairs to this flag, such as max-connections=N or
        replay-lines=N. See
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/interacting-with-serial-console
        for additional options.

     --force-key-file-overwrite
        If enabled, the gcloud command-line tool will regenerate and overwrite
        the files associated with a broken SSH key without asking for
        confirmation in both interactive and non-interactive environments.

        If disabled, the files associated with a broken SSH key will not be
        regenerated and will fail in both interactive and non-interactive
        environments.

     --port=PORT; default=1
        The number of the requested serial port. Can be 1-4, default is 1.

        Instances can support up to four serial ports. By default, this command
        will connect to the first serial port. Setting this flag will connect
        to the requested serial port.

     --ssh-key-file=SSH_KEY_FILE
        The path to the SSH key file. By default, this is
        ~/.ssh/google_compute_engine.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the instance to connect to. If not specified and the
        compute/zone property isn't set, you may be prompted to select a zone.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
