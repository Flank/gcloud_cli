NAME
    gcloud iam roles undelete - undelete a custom role from an organization or
        a project

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud iam roles undelete ROLE_ID
        (--organization=ORGANIZATION | --project=PROJECT_ID)
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    This command undeletes a role. Roles that have been deleted for certain
    long time can't be undeleted.

    This command can fail for the following reasons:
      o The role specified does not exist.
      o The active user does not have permission to access the given role.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     ROLE_ID
        The id of the custom role to undelete. For example: CustomRole. You
        must also specify the --organization or --project flag.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --organization=ORGANIZATION
          The organization of the role you want to undelete.

       --project=PROJECT_ID
          The project of the role you want to undelete.

          The Google Cloud Platform project ID to use for this invocation. If
          omitted, then the current project is assumed; the current project can
          be listed using gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)' and
          can be set using gcloud config set project PROJECTID.

          --project and its fallback core/project property play two roles in
          the invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate
          on. It also specifies the project for API enablement check, quota,
          and billing. To specify a different project for quota and billing,
          use --billing-project or billing/quota_project property.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

        $ gcloud iam roles undelete roles/ProjectUpdater \
            --organization=1234567

    To undelete the role ProjectUpdater of the project myproject, run:

        $ gcloud iam roles undelete roles/ProjectUpdater --project=myproject
