NAME
    gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding - add IAM policy binding
        for a service account

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding SERVICE_ACCOUNT
        --member=MEMBER --role=ROLE [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    This command adds a policy binding to the IAM policy of a service account,
    given an IAM_ACCOUNT and the binding.

    When managing IAM roles, you can treat a service account either as a
    resource or as an identity. This command is to add iam policy bindings to a
    service account resource. There are other gcloud commands to manage IAM
    policies for other types of resources. For example, to manage IAM policies
    on a project, use the $ gcloud projects commands.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     SERVICE_ACCOUNT
        The service account whose policy to add bindings to. The account should
        be formatted either as a numeric service account ID or as an email,
        like this: 123456789876543212345 or my-iam-account@somedomain.com.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --member=MEMBER
        The member to add the binding for. Should be of the form
        user|group|serviceAccount:email or domain:domain.

        Examples: user:test-user@gmail.com, group:admins@example.com,
        serviceAccount:my-sa@test-123.iam.gserviceaccount.com, or
        domain:example.com.

        Can also be one of the following special values:
        * allUsers - anyone who is on the internet, with or without a Google
          account.
        * allAuthenticatedUsers - anyone who is authenticated with a Google
          account or a service account.

     --role=ROLE
        Define the role of the member.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    The following command will add an IAM policy binding for the role of
    'roles/editor' for the user 'test-user@gmail.com' on a service account with
    identifier 'my-iam-account@somedomain.com'

        $ gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding \
            my-iam-account@somedomain.com \
            --member='user:test-user@gmail.com' --role='roles/editor'

    For a service account 'my-sa' linked to project 'test-123', the following
    command will add an IAM policy binding for the role of 'roles/editor' to
    the given service account:

        $ gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding test-123 \
            --member='serviceAccount:my-sa@test-123.iam.gserviceaccount.com'\
         --role='roles/editor'

    The following command will add an IAM policy binding for the role of
    'roles/editor' for all authenticated users on a service account with
    identifier 'my-iam-account@somedomain.com':

        $ gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding \
            my-iam-account@somedomain.com --member='allAuthenticatedUsers' \
            --role='roles/editor'

    policy role and member types.
