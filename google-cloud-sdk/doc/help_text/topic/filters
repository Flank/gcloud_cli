NAME
    gcloud topic filters - resource filters supplementary help

DESCRIPTION
    Most gcloud commands return a list of resources on success. By default they
    are pretty-printed on the standard output. The
    --format=NAME[ATTRIBUTES](PROJECTION) and --filter=EXPRESSION flags along
    with projections can be used to format and change the default output to a
    more meaningful result.

    Use the --format flag to change the default output format of a command. For
    details run $ gcloud topic formats.

    Use the --filter flag to select resources to be listed. Resource filters
    are described in detail below.

    Use resource-keys to reach resource items through a unique path of names
    from the root. For details run $ gcloud topic resource-keys.

    Use projections to list a subset of resource keys in a resource. For
    details run $ gcloud topic projections.

    Note: To refer to a list of fields you can sort, filter, and format by for
    each resource, you can run a list command with the format set to text or
    json. For example, $ gcloud compute instances list --limit=1 --format=text.

    To work through an interactive tutorial about using the filter and format
    flags instead, see:
    https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/open?git_repo=https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-shell-tutorials&page=editor&tutorial=cloudsdk/tutorial.md

    Note: Depending on the specific server API, filtering may be done entirely
    by the client, entirely by the server, or by a combination of both.

  Filter Expressions
    A filter expression is a Boolean function that selects the resources to
    print from a list of resources. Expressions are composed of terms connected
    by logic operators.

     LogicOperator
        Expressions containing both AND and OR must be parenthesized to
        disambiguate precedence.

         NOT term-1
            True if term-1 is False, otherwise False.

         term-1 AND term-2
            True if both term-1 and term-2 are true.

         term-1 OR term-2
            True if at least one of term-1 or term-2 is true.

         term-1 term-2
            Term conjunction (implicit AND) is True if both term-1 and term-2
            are true. Conjunction has lower precedence than OR.

     Terms
        A term is a key operator value tuple, where key is a dotted name that
        evaluates to the value of a resource attribute, and value may be:

         number
            integer or floating point numeric constant
         unquoted literal
            character sequence terminated by space, ( or )
         quoted literal
            "..." or '...' Most filter expressions need to be quoted in shell
            commands. If you use '...' shell quotes then use "..." filter
            string literal quotes and vice versa.

     Operator Terms
         key : simple-pattern
            : operator evaluation is changing for consistency across Google
            APIs. The current default is deprecated and will be dropped
            shortly. A warning will be displayed when a --filter expression
            would return different matches using both the deprecated and new
            implementations.

            The current deprecated default is True if key contains
            simple-pattern. The match is case insensitive. It allows one * that
            matches any sequence of 0 or more characters. If * is specified
            then the match is anchored, meaning all characters from the
            beginning and end of the value must match.

            The new implementation is True if simple-pattern matches any word
            in key. Words are locale specific but typically consist of
            alpha-numeric characters. Non-word characters that do not appear in
            simple-pattern are ignored. The matching is anchored and case
            insensitive. An optional trailing * does a word prefix match.

            Use key:* to test if key is defined and -key:* to test if key is
            undefined.

         key :( simple-pattern ... )
            True if key matches any simple-pattern in the (space, tab, newline,
            comma) separated list.

         key = value
            True if key is equal to value. Equivalent to :, with the exception
            that the trailing * prefix match is not supported.

         key =( value ... )
            True if key is equal to any value in the (space, tab, newline, ,)
            separated list.

         key != value
            True if key is not value. Equivalent to -key=value and NOT
            key=value.

         key < value
            True if key is less than value. If both key and value are numeric
            then numeric comparison is used, otherwise lexicographic string
            comparison is used.

         key <= value
            True if key is less than or equal to value. If both key and value
            are numeric then numeric comparison is used, otherwise
            lexicographic string comparison is used.

         key >= value
            True if key is greater than or equal to value. If both key and
            value are numeric then numeric comparison is used, otherwise
            lexicographic string comparison is used.

         key > value
            True if key is greater than value. If both key and value are
            numeric then numeric comparison is used, otherwise lexicographic
            string comparison is used.

         key ~ value
            True if key matches the RE (regular expression) pattern value.

         key !~ value
            True if key does not match the RE (regular expression) pattern
            value.
