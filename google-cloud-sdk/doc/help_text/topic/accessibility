NAME
    gcloud topic accessibility - reference for Accessibility features

DESCRIPTION
    The accessibility/screen_reader property when set to true will change some
    behavior to make gcloud more screen reader friendly. Currently the
    following changes are implemented:

      o For progress trackers, instead of unicode spinners, the phrase
        'working' will be displayed on stderr, every second while gcloud is
        working.
      o For progress bars, progress will be displayed as a percentage,
        outputted to stderr.
      o Boxed tables will be drawn with ascii characters instead of unicode
        characters. Boxed tables are the default outputs of many list commands.
        Also consider using the --format flag to define your own format.

    To turn this on, run:

        $ gcloud config set accessibility/screen_reader true

    Accessibiliy support is still in early stages. Please report any issues
    that you would like fixed using gcloud feedback.
