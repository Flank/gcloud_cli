NAME
    gcloud topic gcloudignore - reference for .gcloudignore files

DESCRIPTION
    Several commands in gcloud involve uploading the contents of a directory to
    Google Cloud Platform to host or build. In many cases, you will not want to
    upload certain files (i.e., "ignore" them).

    If there is a file called .gcloudignore in the top-level directory to
    upload, the files that it specifies (see "SYNTAX") will be ignored.

    If a .gitignore file is present in the top-level directory to upload and
    there isn't a .gcloudignore file, gcloud will generate a Git-compatible
    .gcloudignore file that respects your .gitignore-ed files (see "ADVANCED
    TOPICS" for details). The global .gitignore is not respected.

    The following gcloud commands respect the .gcloudignore file:

      o gcloud beta functions deploy
      o gcloud container builds submit
      o gcloud beta debug source upload

    To globally disable .gcloudignore parsing (including default file-ignore
    behavior), run:

        $ gcloud config set gcloudignore/enabled false

SYNTAX
    The syntax of .gcloudignore borrows heavily from that of .gitignore; see
    https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore or man gitignore for a full reference.

    Each line in a .gcloudignore is one of the following:

      o pattern: a pattern specifies file names to ignore (or explicitly
        include) in the upload. If multiple patterns match the file name, the
        last matching pattern takes precedence.
      o comment: comments begin with # and are ignored (see "ADVANCED TOPICS"
        for an exception). If you want to include a # at the beginning of a
        pattern, you must escape it: \#.
      o blank line: A blank line is ignored and useful for readability.

    Some example patterns follow; see the full reference
    (https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore or man gitignore) for details.

    To ignore any file named foo, and any file in the root of the upload
    directory named bar:

        foo
        /bar

    To ignore any file starting with foo, ending with bar, or starting with baz
    and ending with qux:

        foo*
        *bar
        baz*qux

    To explicitly include any file named foo (useful if foo was excluded
    earlier in the file) and ignore a file named !bar:

        !foo
        \!bar

    To ignore any directory foo and all its contents (though not a file foo),
    any file baz, and the directory qux and all its contents:

        foo/
        **/baz
        qux/**

  ADVANCED TOPICS
    In order to support Git-related files, there is a special comment syntax:

        #!include:.gitignore

    This will include the contents of a .gitignore-style file at that path at
    that point in the file. It does not recurse (that is, the included file
    cannot #!include another file) and cannot be anywhere but the top-level
    directory to be uploaded.

EXAMPLES
    This .gcloudignore would prevent the upload of the node_modules/ directory
    and any files ending in ~:

        node_modules/
        *~

    This .gcloudignore (similar to the one generated when Git files are
    present) would prevent the upload of the .gcloudignore file, the .git
    directory, and any files in ignored in the .gitignore file:

        .gcloudignore
        # If you would like to upload your .git directory, .gitignore file or
        # files from your .gitignore file, remove the corresponding line below:
        .git
        .gitignore
        #!include:.gitignore
