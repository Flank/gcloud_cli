NAME
    gcloud topic uninstall - supplementary help for uninstalling Cloud SDK

DESCRIPTION
Uninstalling Google Cloud SDK

    Note: For installations completed using an OS package (such as apt-get,
    yum, etc.), uninstall Cloud SDK via the OS package manager.

    Note: For Windows installations, execute the uninstaller.exe found under
    your Cloud SDK directory.

    To completely remove Cloud SDK, follow these instructions:

      o Locate your installation directory by running:

        $ gcloud info --format='value(installation.sdk_root)'

      o Locate your user config directory (typically ~/.config/gcloud on
        MacOS and Linux) by running:

        $ gcloud info --format='value(config.paths.global_config_dir)'

      o Delete both these directories.

      o Additionally, remove lines sourcing completion.bash.inc and
        paths.bash.inc in your .bashrc or equivalent shell init file, if you
        added them during installation.
