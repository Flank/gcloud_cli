DESCRIPTION
    Client certificate authorization supplementary help.

    Device Certificate Authorization (DCA) enables Context-aware access to
    identify devices by their X.509 certificates. DCA for Google Cloud Platform
    APIs is the second in a series of releases that provides administrators the
    capability to protect access to their Google Cloud Platform resources with
    device certificates. This feature builds on top of the existing
    Context-aware access suite (Endpoint Verification, Access Context Manager,
    and VPC Service Controls) and ensures that only users on trusted devices
    with a Google-generated certificate are able to access Google Cloud
    Platform APIs. This provides a stronger signal of device identity (device
    certificate verification), and protects users from credential theft to
    accidental loss by only granting access when credentials and the original
    device certificate are presented.

    To use this feature, organizations can follow the instructions below to
    install an endpoint verification agent to devices:

      o Automatically deploy endpoint verification
        (https://support.google.com/a/answer/9007320#)
        * Via Chrome Policy for the extension
        * 3rd party image/software distribution tools for the Native Helper
          on macOS and Windows
      o Let users install endpoint verification themselves from the Chrome
        Webstore (https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9018161#install)
        * Users would also be prompted to install the Native Helper as well

    Run $ gcloud config set context_aware/use_client_certificate True so that
    the gcloud CLI will load the certificate and send it to services. Some
    services do not support client certificate authorization yet. When the
    gcloud CLI sends requests to such services, the client certificate will be
    ignored.

    The following is the list of services which support client certificate
    authorization in the installed version of the gcloud CLI.

      SERVICE     VERSION  NOTES
       ---        ---      ---
      pubsub      v1
      spanner     v1
      ---         ---      ---
      iap_tunnel  v4       tunnel connection between gcloud and IAP tunnel
                           service

    See https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/topic/client-certificate
    for the support list for the latest version of the gcloud CLI. Please
    upgrade the gcloud command-line tool if necessary.

    Note: iap_tunnel is a special service gcloud CLI uses to create the IAP
    tunnel. For example, gcloud compute start-iap-tunnel can start a tunnel to
    Cloud Identity-Aware Proxy through which another process can create a
    connection (e.g. SSH, RDP) to a Google Compute Engine instance. Client
    certificate authorization is supported in tunnel creation.
