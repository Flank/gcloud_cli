NAME
    gcloud topic offline-help - setting up gcloud command offline help

DESCRIPTION
    There are many ways to access gcloud command help. Only the first requires
    online access:

      o Browse https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/ for the most
        recent Cloud SDK release online documents.

      o Add the --help flag to any command. This will render a man style
        document in a terminal pager. The document is always up to date with
        the command because it is generated by collating help text from the
        command itself.

      o Use the gcloud beta interactive shell which has as-you-type help.
        Like --help, the interactive help documents are always up to date with
        the gcloud installation.

      o Generate HTML documents in a local directory and point your browser
        to the generated index.html for offline browsing. Hover over a
        navigation item to focus the menu, hover to the left to expand it
        again. More details on this below.

      o Generate and install man(1) style documents on a local host. More
        details on this below.

    All of these methods have the same content, all generated from a Cloud SDK
    gcloud installation. The last two are user maintained and can become out of
    date. Either use them for one time offline access, or make them part of
    your Cloud SDK installation/update routine.

  Generating offline HTML documents
    To generate HTML documents for offline browsing:

        # Select an empty directory where the HTML and supporting *.css* and
        # *.js* files will be generated.
        HTML_DIR=<some-local-directory>

        # Generate the HTML in $HTML_DIR.
        # Should take ~1 min, 10 min or more on slower systems.
        gcloud meta generate-help-docs --html-dir=$HTML_DIR

    Then enter this URL in the browser address/search bar, where $HTML_DIR must
    be the actual path name of the directory:

        file://$HTML_DIR/index.html

  Generating offline manpage documents
    To generate man page documents for the man(1) command:

        # Select an empty directory where the man page files will be generated.
        MANPAGE_DIR=<some-local-directory>

        # Generate the man pages in $MANPAGE_DIR.
        # Should take ~1 min, 10 min or more on slower systems.
        gcloud meta generate-help-docs --manpage-dir=$MANPAGE_DIR

        # Append $MANPAGE_DIR to the MANPATH environment variable:
        export MANPATH=$MANPATH:$MANPAGE_dir

    Then run the man command on gcloud manpages:

        man gcloud info
