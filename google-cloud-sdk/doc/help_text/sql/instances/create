DESCRIPTION
    Creates a new Cloud SQL instance.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE
        Cloud SQL instance ID.

FLAGS
     --activation-policy=ACTIVATION_POLICY
        Activation policy for this instance. This specifies when the instance
        should be activated and is applicable only when the instance state is
        RUNNABLE. The default is on-demand. More information on activation
        policies can be found here:
        https://cloud.google.com/sql/faq#activation_policy. ACTIVATION_POLICY
        must be one of: always, never, on-demand.

     --[no-]assign-ip
        Assign an IPv4 external address to this instance. This setting is
        enabled by default when creating a new instance, but can be disabled to
        use private IP connectivity. Use --assign-ip to enable and
        --no-assign-ip to disable.

     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --authorized-gae-apps=APP,[APP,...]
        First Generation instances only. List of project IDs for App Engine
        applications running in the Standard environment that can access this
        instance.

     --authorized-networks=NETWORK,[NETWORK,...]
        The list of external networks that are allowed to connect to the
        instance. Specified in CIDR notation, also known as 'slash' notation
        (e.g. 192.168.100.0/24).

     --availability-type=AVAILABILITY_TYPE
        Specifies level of availability. AVAILABILITY_TYPE must be one of:

         regional
            Provides high availability and is recommended for production
            instances; instance automatically fails over to another zone within
            your selected region.
         zonal
            Provides no failover capability. This is the default.

     --backup
        Enables daily backup. Enabled by default, use --no-backup to disable.

     --backup-start-time=BACKUP_START_TIME
        Start time of daily backups, specified in the 24 hour format - HH:MM,
        in the UTC timezone.

     --cpu=CPU
        Whole number value indicating how many cores are desired in the
        machine. Both --cpu and --memory must be specified if a custom machine
        type is desired, and the --tier flag must be omitted.

     --database-flags=FLAG=VALUE,[FLAG=VALUE,...]
        Comma-separated list of database flags to set on the instance. Use an
        equals sign to separate flag name and value. Flags without values, like
        skip_grant_tables, can be written out without a value after, e.g.,
        skip_grant_tables=. Use on/off for booleans. View the Instance Resource
        API for allowed flags. (e.g., --database-flags
        max_allowed_packet=55555,skip_grant_tables=,log_output=1)

     --database-version=DATABASE_VERSION
        The database engine type and version. If left unspecified, the API
        defaults will be used. DATABASE_VERSION must be one of: MYSQL_5_5,
        MYSQL_5_6, MYSQL_5_7, POSTGRES_9_6, POSTGRES_11.

     --enable-bin-log
        Specified if binary log should be enabled. If backup configuration is
        disabled, binary log must be disabled as well.

     --failover-replica-name=FAILOVER_REPLICA_NAME
        Also create a failover replica with the specified name.

     --follow-gae-app=FOLLOW_GAE_APP
        First Generation instances only. The App Engine app this instance
        should follow. It must be in the same region as the instance.

     --maintenance-release-channel=MAINTENANCE_RELEASE_CHANNEL
        Which channel's updates to apply during the maintenance window. If not
        specified, Cloud SQL chooses the timing of updates to your instance.
        MAINTENANCE_RELEASE_CHANNEL must be one of:

         preview
            Preview updates release prior to production updates. You may wish
            to use the preview channel for dev/test applications so that you
            can preview their compatibility with your application prior to the
            production release.
         production
            Production updates are stable and recommended for applications in
            production.

     --maintenance-window-day=MAINTENANCE_WINDOW_DAY
        Day of week for maintenance window, in UTC time zone.
        MAINTENANCE_WINDOW_DAY must be one of: SUN, MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI,
        SAT.

     --maintenance-window-hour=MAINTENANCE_WINDOW_HOUR
        Hour of day for maintenance window, in UTC time zone.

     --master-instance-name=MASTER_INSTANCE_NAME
        Name of the instance which will act as master in the replication setup.
        The newly created instance will be a read replica of the specified
        master instance.

     --memory=MEMORY
        Whole number value indicating how much memory is desired in the
        machine. A size unit should be provided (eg. 3072MiB or 9GiB) - if no
        units are specified, GiB is assumed. Both --cpu and --memory must be
        specified if a custom machine type is desired, and the --tier flag must
        be omitted.

     --pricing-plan=PRICING_PLAN, -p PRICING_PLAN; default="PER_USE"
        First Generation instances only. The pricing plan for this instance.
        PRICING_PLAN must be one of: PER_USE, PACKAGE.

     --replica-type=REPLICA_TYPE
        The type of replica to create. REPLICA_TYPE must be one of: READ,
        FAILOVER.

     --replication=REPLICATION
        Type of replication this instance uses. The default is synchronous.
        REPLICATION must be one of: synchronous, asynchronous.

     --require-ssl
        Specified if users connecting over IP must use SSL.

     --root-password=ROOT_PASSWORD
        Root Cloud SQL user's password.

     --storage-auto-increase
        Storage size can be increased, but it cannot be decreased; storage
        increases are permanent for the life of the instance. With this setting
        enabled, a spike in storage requirements can result in permanently
        increased storage costs for your instance. However, if an instance runs
        out of available space, it can result in the instance going offline,
        dropping existing connections. This setting is enabled by default.

     --storage-size=STORAGE_SIZE
        Amount of storage allocated to the instance. Must be an integer number
        of GB. The default is 10GB. Information on storage limits can be found
        here: https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/quotas#storage_limits

     --storage-type=STORAGE_TYPE
        The storage type for the instance. The default is SSD. STORAGE_TYPE
        must be one of: SSD, HDD.

     --tier=TIER, -t TIER
        The tier for this instance. For Second Generation instances, TIER is
        the instance's machine type (e.g., db-n1-standard-1). For PostgreSQL
        instances, only shared-core machine types (e.g., db-f1-micro) apply. A
        complete list of tiers is available here:
        https://cloud.google.com/sql/pricing.

        IMPORTANT: First Generation instances are deprecated. If you're
        considering any First Generation tiers, we recommend using Second
        Generation instead.

     Key resource - The Cloud KMS (Key Management Service) cryptokey that will
     be used to protect the instance. The 'Compute Engine Service Agent'
     service account must hold permission 'Cloud KMS CryptoKey
     Encrypter/Decrypter'. The arguments in this group can be used to specify
     the attributes of this resource.

       --disk-encryption-key=DISK_ENCRYPTION_KEY
          ID of the key or fully qualified identifier for the key. This flag
          must be specified if any of the other arguments in this group are
          specified.

       --disk-encryption-key-keyring=DISK_ENCRYPTION_KEY_KEYRING
          The KMS keyring of the key.

       --disk-encryption-key-location=DISK_ENCRYPTION_KEY_LOCATION
          The Cloud location for the key.

       --disk-encryption-key-project=DISK_ENCRYPTION_KEY_PROJECT
          The Cloud project for the key.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --region=REGION; default="us-central"
          Regional location (e.g. asia-east1, us-east1). See the full list of
          regions at https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/instance-locations.

       At most one of these may be specified:

         --gce-zone=GCE_ZONE
            (DEPRECATED) Preferred Compute Engine zone (e.g. us-central1-a,
            us-central1-b, etc.).

            Flag --gce-zone is deprecated and will be removed by release
            255.0.0. Use --zone instead.

         --zone=ZONE
            Preferred Compute Engine zone (e.g. us-central1-a, us-central1-b,
            etc.).
