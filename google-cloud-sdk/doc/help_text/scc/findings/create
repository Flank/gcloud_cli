          positional must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
          group are specified.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION
          (Optional) If the full resource name isn't provided e.g.
          organizations/123, then provide the organization id which is the
          suffix of the organization. Example: organizations/123, the id is
          123.

       --source=SOURCE
          (Optional) If the full resource name isn't provided e.g.
          organizations/123/sources/456, then provide the source id which is
          the suffix of the source. Example: organizations/123/sources/456, the
          id is 456.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --category=CATEGORY
        Taxonomy group within findings from a given source. Example:

        is for.

OPTIONAL FLAGS

        well formed URL.

     --source-properties=[SOURCE_PROPERTIES,...]

        must be between 1 and 255 characters, and must start with a letter and

            --source=5678 --state=ACTIVE \
            --resource-name='//cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/v1/projec\
        ts/example-project'

    Create an ACTIVE my-finding with category: XSS_SCRIPTING under organization
    123456 and source 5678:

        $ gcloud scc findings create my-finding --organization=123456 \
            --source=5678 --state=ACTIVE --category='XSS_SCRIPTING'
