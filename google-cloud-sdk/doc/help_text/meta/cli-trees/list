NAME
    gcloud meta cli-trees list - list the installed gcloud interactive CLI
        trees

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud meta cli-trees list [--directory=DIRECTORY] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    This command lists all CLI trees found in the Cloud SDK installation and
    config directories. Duplicates may be listed; commands that load the trees
    search the configuration directory first.

    A CLI tree is a module or JSON file that describes a command and its
    subcommands, flags, arguments, help text and TAB completers. gcloud
    interactive uses CLI trees for typeahead, command line completion, and
    as-you-type documentation.

    Most CLI tree files are cached in the cli subdirectory of the gcloud
    installation root directory. The cache is automatically updated by the
    Cloud SDK installers and the gcloud components command group.

FLAGS
     --directory=DIRECTORY
        Insert this directory into the list of directories to search.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

NOTES
    This command is an internal implementation detail and may change or
    disappear without notice.
