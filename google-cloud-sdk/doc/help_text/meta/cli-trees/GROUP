NAME
    gcloud meta cli-trees - CLI trees manager

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud meta cli-trees COMMAND [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    The gcloud meta cli-trees group generates, updates and lists static CLI
    trees.

    A CLI tree is a module or JSON file that describes a command and its
    subcommands, flags, arguments, help text and TAB completers. $ gcloud
    interactive uses CLI trees for typeahead, command line completion, and
    as-you-type documentation, $ gcloud uses its CLI tree for static
    completion, and $ gcloud search help uses the gcloud CLI tree to search
    help text.

    Packaged CLI tree files are installed in the cli/data subdirectory of the
    gcloud installation root directory. These trees are updated by $ gcloud
    components install and $ gcloud components update. Other CLI trees are
    generated on demand and cached in the per project cli config directory.
    Each CLI tree is version-stamped to its command version and is updated when
    the command changes.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

    COMMAND is one of the following:

     list
        List the installed gcloud interactive CLI trees.

     update
        Updates gcloud CLI command trees in the installation directory.

NOTES
    This command is an internal implementation detail and may change or
    disappear without notice.
