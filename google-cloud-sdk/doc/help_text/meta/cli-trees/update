NAME
    gcloud meta cli-trees update - updates gcloud CLI command trees in the
        installation directory

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud meta cli-trees update [--commands=[COMMAND,...]]
        [--directory=DIRECTORY] [--force] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    A CLI tree is a module or JSON file that describes a command and its
    subcommands, flags, arguments, help text and TAB completers. gcloud
    interactive uses CLI trees for typeahead, command line completion, and
    as-you-type documentation.

    Most CLI tree files are cached in the cli subdirectory of the gcloud
    installation root directory. The cache is automatically updated by the
    Cloud SDK installers and the gcloud components command group.

    These CLIs are currently supported: bq, gcloud, gsutil, kubectl.

FLAGS
     --commands=[COMMAND,...]
        Update only the commands in this list.

     --directory=DIRECTORY
        Update this directory instead of the default installation directory.

     --force
        Force existing CLI trees to be out of date. This causes them to be
        regenerated.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is an internal implementation detail and may change or
    disappear without notice.
