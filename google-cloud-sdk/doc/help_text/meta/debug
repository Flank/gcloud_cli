NAME
    gcloud meta debug - run an interactive debug console with the Cloud SDK
        libraries loaded

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud meta debug [--mode=MODE; default="python"] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    This command runs an interactive console with the Cloud SDK libraries
    loaded.

    It's useful for:

      o Manually testing out an API.
      o Exploring available Cloud SDK core libraries.
      o Debugging specific problems.

    It comes with many utilities pre-loaded in the environment:

      o All API clients loaded with one command (LoadApis()). Then, for
        instance, appengine refers to the App Engine API client.
      o Many common Cloud SDK imports pre-imported (e.g. core.util.files,
        console_io, properties).

    Use dir() to explore them all.

FLAGS
     --mode=MODE; default="python"

        python.
