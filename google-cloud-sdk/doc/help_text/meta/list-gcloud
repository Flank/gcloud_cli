NAME
    gcloud meta list-gcloud - list the gcloud CLI command tree with flag,
        positional and help details

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud meta list-gcloud [--branch=COMMAND_PATH] [--completions]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    List the gcloud CLI command tree with flag, positional and help details.

FLAGS
     --branch=COMMAND_PATH
        The branch of the CLI subtree to generate as a dotted command path.
        Mainly used to generate test data. For example, for the gcloud compute
        instances branch use "compute.instances".

     --completions
        List the static completion CLI tree. This is a stripped down variant of
        the CLI tree that only contains the subcommand and flag name
        dictionaries. The tree is written as a Python source file (~1MiB) that
        loads fast (~30ms) as a .pyc file.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

NOTES
    This command is an internal implementation detail and may change or
    disappear without notice.
