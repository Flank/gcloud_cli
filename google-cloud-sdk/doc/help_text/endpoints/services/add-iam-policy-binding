    'test-user@gmail.com' on a service with identifier 'my-service'

        $ gcloud endpoints services add-iam-policy-binding my-service \
            --member='user:test-user@gmail.com' \
            --role='roles/servicemanagement.serviceConsumer'

    For a service account 'my-sa' linked to project 'test-123', the following
