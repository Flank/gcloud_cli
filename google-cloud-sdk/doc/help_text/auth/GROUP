SYNOPSIS
    gcloud auth GROUP | COMMAND [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION

    Cloud SDK (gcloud) to access Google Cloud Platform. Typically, when

    activate-service-account is recommended.

    For more information on authorization and credential types, see:

    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
