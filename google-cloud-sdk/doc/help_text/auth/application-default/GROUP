NAME
    gcloud auth application-default - manage your active Application Default
        Credentials

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud auth application-default COMMAND [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Application Default Credentials (ADC) provide a method to get credentials
    used in calling Google APIs. The gcloud auth application-default command
    group allows you to manage active credentials on your machine that are used
    for local application development.

    These credentials are only used by Google client libraries in your own
    application.

    More information on ADC and how they work can be found here:
    https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

COMMANDS
    COMMAND is one of the following:

     login
        Acquire new user credentials to use for Application Default
        Credentials.

     print-access-token
        Print an access token for your current Application Default Credentials.

     revoke
        Revoke previously generated Application Default Credentials.

EXAMPLES
    To create a service account and have your application use it for API
    access, run:

        $ gcloud iam service-accounts create my-account
        $ gcloud iam service-accounts keys create key.json
          --iam-account=my-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
        $ export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=key.json
        $ ./my_application.sh

    To temporarily use your own user credentials, run:

        $ gcloud auth application-default login

    This will take you through a web flow to acquire new user credentials.

NOTES
    This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta auth application-default
