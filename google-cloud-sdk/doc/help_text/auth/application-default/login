NAME
    gcloud auth application-default login - acquire new user credentials to use
        for Application Default Credentials

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud auth application-default login [--client-id-file=CLIENT_ID_FILE]
        [--no-launch-browser] [--scopes=SCOPES,[SCOPES,...]]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Obtains user access credentials via a web flow and puts them in the
    well-known location for Application Default Credentials to use them as a
    proxy for a service account.

    This command is useful when you are developing code that would normally use
    a service account but need to run the code in a local development
    environment where it's easier to provide user credentials. The credentials
    will apply to all API calls that make use of the Application Default
    Credentials client library. Moreover, the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
    environment variable which is set depending on the code's environment
    cannot be set once this command is run. To manually set this variable,
    refer to instructions at
    https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials#calling.

    API enablement and quotas are managed by the master Application Default
    Credentials project. In the case of errors related to the API not being
    enabled or quota limitations, use the --client-id-file flag. You can create
    the client-id-file at https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials.

    This command has no effect on the user account(s) set up by the gcloud auth
    login command.

    Any credentials previously generated by gcloud auth application-default
    login will be overwritten.

FLAGS
     --client-id-file=CLIENT_ID_FILE
        A file containing your own client id to use to login.

     --launch-browser
        Launch a browser for authorization. If not enabled or DISPLAY variable
        is not set, prints a URL to standard output to be copied. Enabled by
        default, use --no-launch-browser to disable.

     --scopes=SCOPES,[SCOPES,...]
        The names of the scopes to authorize for. By default
        https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email,
        https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform scopes are used. The
        list of possible scopes can be found at:
        https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/googlescopes.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    If you want your local application to temporarily use your own user
    credentials for API access, run:

        $ gcloud auth application-default login

    If you'd like to login by passing in a file containing your own client id,
    run:

        $ gcloud auth application-default login \
            --client-id-file=clientid.json

NOTES
    This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta auth application-default login
