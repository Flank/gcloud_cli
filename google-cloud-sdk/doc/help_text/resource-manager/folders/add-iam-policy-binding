NAME
    gcloud resource-manager folders add-iam-policy-binding - add IAM policy
        binding for a folder

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud resource-manager folders add-iam-policy-binding FOLDER
        --member=MEMBER --role=ROLE
        [--condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          | --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Adds a policy binding to the IAM policy of a folder, given a folder ID and
    the binding. One binding consists of a member, a role, and an optional
    condition.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Folder resource - The ID of the folder to add the IAM binding. This
     represents a Cloud resource. This must be specified.

       FOLDER
          ID of the folder or fully qualified identifier for the folder.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --member=MEMBER
        The member to add the binding for. Should be of the form
        user|group|serviceAccount:email or domain:domain.

        Examples: user:test-user@gmail.com, group:admins@example.com,
        serviceAccount:test123@example.domain.com, or
        domain:example.domain.com.

        Can also be one of the following special values:
        * allUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone who is on the
          internet, with or without a Google account.
        * allAuthenticatedUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone
          who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account.

     --role=ROLE
        Define the role of the member.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     At most one of these may be specified:

       --condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          Condition of the binding to be added. When condition is explicitly
          specified as None (e.g. --condition=None), a binding without a
          condition is added. When --condition is specified and is not a None
          condition, --role cannot be a primitive role. Primitive roles are
          roles/editor, roles/owner, and roles/viewer.

       expression
          (Required) Expression of the condition which evaluates to True or
          False. This uses a subset of Common Expression Language syntax.

       title
          (Required) Title for the expression, i.e. a short string describing
          its purpose.

       description
          (Optional) Description for the expression. This is a longer text
          which describes the expression.

          NOTE: An unsatisfied condition will not allow access via this
          binding.

       --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE
          Path to a local JSON or YAML file that defines the condition. To see
          available fields, see the help for --condition.
