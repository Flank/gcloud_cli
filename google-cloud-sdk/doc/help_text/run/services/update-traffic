DESCRIPTION
    Adjust the trafic assignments for a Cloud Run service.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Service resource - Service to update the configuration of. The arguments
     in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource.

       [SERVICE]
          ID of the service or fully qualified identifier for the service.

       --namespace=NAMESPACE
          Specific to Cloud Run for Anthos: Kubernetes namespace for the
          service.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --platform=PLATFORM
        Target platform for running commands. Alternatively, set the property
        [run/platform]. If not specified, the user will be prompted to choose a
        platform. PLATFORM must be one of:

         managed
            Fully managed version of Cloud Run. Use with the --region flag or
            set the [run/region] property to specify a Cloud Run region.
         gke
            Cloud Run for Anthos on Google Cloud. Use with the --cluster and
            --cluster-location flags or set the [run/cluster] and
            [run/cluster_location] properties to specify a cluster in a given
            zone.
         kubernetes
            Use a Knative-compatible kubernetes cluster. Use with the
            --kubeconfig and --context flags to specify a kubeconfig file and
            the context for connecting.

     Arguments to locate resources, depending on the platform used. At most one
     of these may be specified:

       Only applicable if connecting to Cloud Run (fully managed). Specify
       --platform=managed to use:

         --region=REGION
            Region in which the resource can be found. Alternatively, set the
            property [run/region].

       Only applicable if connecting to Cloud Run for Anthos deployed on Google
       Cloud. Specify --platform=gke to use:

         Cluster resource - Kubernetes Engine cluster to connect to. The
         arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
         resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group
         but can be set in other ways. To set the [project] attribute: provide
         the argument [--cluster] on the command line with a fully specified
         name; set the property [run/cluster] with a fully specified name;
         specify the cluster from a list of available clusters with a fully
         specified name; provide the argument [--project] on the command line;
         set the property [core/project].

           --cluster=CLUSTER
              ID of the cluster or fully qualified identifier for the cluster.

           --cluster-location=CLUSTER_LOCATION
              Zone in which the cluster is located. Alternatively, set the
              property [run/cluster_location].

       Only applicable if connecting to Cloud Run for Anthos deployed on
       VMware. Specify --platform=kubernetes to use:

         --context=CONTEXT
            The name of the context in your kubectl config file to use for
            connecting.

         --kubeconfig=KUBECONFIG
            The absolute path to your kubectl config file. If not specified,
            the colon- or semicolon-delimited list of paths specified by
            $KUBECONFIG will be used. If $KUBECONFIG is unset, this defaults to
            ~/.kube/config.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --to-latest
          True to assign 100 percent of traffic to the 'latest' revision of
          this service. Note that when a new revision is created, it will
          become the 'latest' and traffic will be directed to it. Defaults to
          False. Synonymous with '--to-revisions=LATEST=100'.

       --to-revisions=[REVISION-NAME=PERCENTAGE,...]
          Comma separated list of traffic assignments in the form
          REVISION-NAME=PERCENTAGE. REVISION-NAME must be the name for a
          revision for the service as returned by 'gcloud beta run list
          revisions'. PERCENTAGE must be an integer percentage between 0 and
          100 inclusive. Ex service-nw9hs=10,service-nw9hs=20 Up to 100 percent
          of traffic may be assigned. If 100 percent of traffic is assigned,
          the Service traffic is updated as specified. If under 100 percent of
          traffic is assigned, the Service traffic is updated as specified for
          revisions with assignments and traffic is scaled up or down down
          proportionally as needed for revision that are currently serving
          traffic but that do not have new assignments. For example assume
          revision-1 is serving 40 percent of traffic and revision-2 is serving
          60 percent. If revision-1 is assigned 45 percent of traffic and no
          assignment is made for revision-2, the service is updated with
          revsion-1 assigned 45 percent of traffic and revision-2 scaled down
          to 55 percent. You can use "LATEST" as a special revision name to
          always put the given percentage of traffic on the latest ready
          revision.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To assign 10% of traffic to revision myservice-s5sxn and 90% of traffic to
    revision myservice-cp9kw run:

        $ gcloud run services update-traffic myservice \
          --to-revisions=myservice-s5sxn=10,myservice-cp9kw=90

    To increase the traffic to revision myservice-s5sxn to 20% and by reducing
    the traffic to revision myservice-cp9kw to 80% run:

        $ gcloud run services update-traffic myservice \
          --to-revisions=myservice-s5sxn=20

    To rollback to revision myservice-cp9kw run:

        $ gcloud run services update-traffic myservice \
          --to-revisions=myservice-cp9kw=100

    To assign 100% of traffic to the current or future LATEST revision run:

        $ gcloud run services update-traffic myservice --to-latest

    You can also refer to the current or future LATEST revision in
    --to-revisions by the string "LATEST". For example, to set 10% of traffic
    to always float to the latest revision:

        $ gcloud run services update-traffic myservice \
          --to-revisions=LATEST=10

NOTES
    These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud alpha run services update-traffic
        $ gcloud beta run services update-traffic
