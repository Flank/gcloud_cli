NAME
    gcloud config get-value - print the value of a Cloud SDK property

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud config get-value SECTION/PROPERTY [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud config get-value prints the property value from your active
    configuration only.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     SECTION/PROPERTY
        The property to be fetched. Note that SECTION/ is optional while
        referring to properties in the core section.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

AVAILABLE PROPERTIES
     core
         account
            Account gcloud should use for authentication. Run gcloud auth list
            to see your currently available accounts.

         custom_ca_certs_file
            Absolute path to a custom CA cert file.

         default_regional_backend_service
            If True, backend services in gcloud compute backend-services will
            be regional by default. Setting the --global flag is required for
            global backend services.

         disable_color
            If True, color will not be used when printing messages in the
            terminal.

         disable_prompts
            If True, the default answer will be assumed for all user prompts.
            However, for any prompts that require user input, an error will be
            raised. This is equivalent to either using the global --quiet flag
            or setting the environment variable CLOUDSDK_CORE_DISABLE_PROMPTS
            to 1. Setting this property is useful when scripting with gcloud.

         disable_usage_reporting
            If True, anonymous statistics on SDK usage will not be collected.
            This value is set by default based on your choices during
            installation, but can be changed at any time. For more information,
            see: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/usage-statistics

         log_http
            If True, log HTTP requests and responses to the logs. To see logs
            in the terminal, adjust verbosity settings. Otherwise, logs are
            available in their respective log files.

         max_log_days
            Maximum number of days to retain log files before deleting. If set
            to 0, turns off log garbage collection and does not delete log
            files. If unset, the default is 30 days.

         pass_credentials_to_gsutil
            If True, pass the configured Cloud SDK authentication to gsutil.

         project
            Project ID of the Cloud Platform project to operate on by default.
            This can be overridden by using the global --project flag.

         show_structured_logs
            Control when JSON-structured log messages for the current verbosity
            level (and above) will be written to standard error. If this
            property is disabled, logs are formatted as text by default.

            Valid values are:
            + never - Log messages as text
            + always - Always log messages as JSON
            + log - Only log messages as JSON if stderr is a file
            + terminal - Only log messages as JSON if stderr is a terminal

    If unset, default is never.

         trace_token
            Token used to route traces of service requests for investigation of
            issues. This token will be provided by Google support.

         user_output_enabled
            True, by default. If False, messages to the user and command output
            on both standard output and standard error will be suppressed.

         verbosity
            Default logging verbosity for gcloud commands. This is the
            equivalent of using the global --verbosity flag. Supported
            verbosity levels: debug, info, warning, error, and none.

     app
         cloud_build_timeout
            Timeout, in seconds, to wait for Docker builds to complete during
            deployments. All Docker builds now use the Cloud Build API.

         promote_by_default
            If True, when deploying a new version of a service, that version
            will be promoted to receive all traffic for the service. This
            property can be overridden via the --promote-by-default or
            --no-promote-by-default flags.

         stop_previous_version
            If True, when deploying a new version of a service, the previously
            deployed version is stopped. If False, older versions must be
            stopped manually.

         use_runtime_builders
            If set, opt in/out to a new code path for building applications
            using pre-fabricated runtimes that can be updated independently of
            client tooling. If not set, the default path for each runtime is
            used.

     auth
         disable_credentials
            If True, gcloud will not attempt to load any credentials or
            authenticate any requests. This is useful when behind a proxy that
            adds authentication to requests.

     billing
         quota_project
            Project that will be charged quota for the operations performed in
            gcloud. When unset, the default is [CURRENT_PROJECT]; this will
            charge quota against the currently set project for operations
            performed on it. Additionally, some existing APIs will continue to
            use a shared project for quota by default, when this property is
            unset.

            If you need to operate on one project, but need quota against a
            different project, you can use this property to specify the
            alternate project.

     builds
         timeout
            Timeout, in seconds, to wait for builds to complete.

     component_manager
         additional_repositories
            Comma separated list of additional repositories to check for
            components. This property is automatically managed by the gcloud
            components repositories commands.

         disable_update_check
            If True, Cloud SDK will not automatically check for updates.

     composer
         location
            Composer location to use. Each Composer location constitutes an
            independent resource namespace constrained to deploying
            environments into Compute Engine regions inside this location. This
            parameter corresponds to the /locations/<location> segment of the
            Composer resource URIs being referenced.

     compute
         region
            Default region to use when working with regional Compute Engine
            resources. When a --region flag is required but not provided, the
            command will fall back to this value, if set. To see valid choices,
            run gcloud compute regions list.

         use_new_list_usable_subnets_api
            If True, use the new API for listing usable subnets which only
            returns subnets in the current project.

         zone
            Default zone to use when working with zonal Compute Engine
            resources. When a --zone flag is required but not provided, the
            command will fall back to this value, if set. To see valid choices,
            run gcloud compute zones list.

     container
         build_timeout
            Timeout, in seconds, to wait for container builds to complete.

         cluster
            Name of the cluster to use by default when working with Kubernetes
            Engine.

         new_scopes_behavior
            If True, use new scopes behavior and do not add compute-rw,
            storage-ro, service-control, or service-management scopes. The
            former two (compute-rw and storage-ro) only apply to clusters at
            Kubernetes v1.9 and below; starting v1.10, compute-rw and
            storage-ro are not added by default. Any of these scopes may be
            added explicitly using --scopes. Using new scopes behavior will be
            the default in a future release. Additionally, if this property is
            set to True, using --[no-]enable-cloud-endpoints is not allowed.
            This property is ignored in alpha and beta, since these tracks
            always use the new behavior. See --scopes help for more info.

         use_application_default_credentials
            If True, use application default credentials to authenticate to the
            cluster API server.

         use_client_certificate
            If True, use the cluster's client certificate to authenticate to
            the cluster API server.

     dataproc
         region
            Cloud Dataproc region to use. Each Cloud Dataproc region
            constitutes an independent resource namespace constrained to
            deploying instances into Compute Engine zones inside the region.
            The default value of global is a special multi-region namespace
            which is capable of deploying instances into all Compute Engine
            zones globally, and is disjoint from other Cloud Dataproc regions.

     deployment_manager
         glob_imports
            Enable import path globbing. Uses glob patterns to match multiple
            imports in a config file.

     filestore
         location
            Default location to use when working with Cloud Filestore
            locations. When a --location flag is required but not provided, the
            command will fall back to this value, if set.

     functions
         region
            Default region to use when working with Cloud Functions resources.
            When a --region flag is required but not provided, the command will
            fall back to this value, if set. To see valid choices, run gcloud
            beta functions regions list.

     gcloudignore
         enabled
            If True, do not upload .gcloudignore files (see $ gcloud topic
            gcloudignore). If False, turn off the gcloudignore mechanism
            entirely and upload all files.

     interactive
         bottom_bindings_line
            If True, display the bottom key bindings line.

         bottom_status_line
            If True, display the bottom status line.

         completion_menu_lines
            Number of lines in the completion menu.

         context
            Command context string.

         fixed_prompt_position
            If True, display the prompt at the same position.

         help_lines
            Maximum number of help snippet lines.

         hidden
            If True, expose hidden commands/flags.

         justify_bottom_lines
            If True, left- and right-justify bottom toolbar lines.

         manpage_generator
            If True, use the manpage CLI tree generator for unsupported
            commands.

         multi_column_completion_menu
            If True, display the completions as a multi-column menu.

         prompt
            Command prompt string.

         show_help
            If True, show help as command args are being entered.

         suggest
            If True, add command line suggestions based on history.

     ml_engine
         local_python
            Full path to the Python interpreter to use for Cloud ML Engine
            local predict/train jobs. If not specified, the default path is the
            one to the Python interpreter found on system PATH.

         polling_interval
            Interval (in seconds) at which to poll logs from your Cloud ML
            Engine jobs. Note that making it much faster than the default (60)
            will quickly use all of your quota.

     proxy
         address
            Hostname or IP address of proxy server.

         password
            Password to use when connecting, if the proxy requires
            authentication.

         port
            Port to use when connected to the proxy server.

         rdns
            If True, DNS queries will not be performed locally, and instead,
            handed to the proxy to resolve. This is default behavior.

         type
            Type of proxy being used. Supported proxy types are: [http,
            http_no_tunnel, socks4, socks5].

         username
            Username to use when connecting, if the proxy requires
            authentication.

     redis
         region
            Default region to use when working with Cloud Memorystore for Redis
            resources. When a region is required but not provided by a flag,
            the command will fall back to this value, if set.

     spanner
         instance
            Default instance to use when working with Cloud Spanner resources.
            When an instance is required but not provided by a flag, the
            command will fall back to this value, if set.
