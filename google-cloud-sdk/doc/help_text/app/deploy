NAME
    gcloud app deploy - deploy the local code and/or configuration of your app
        to App Engine

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud app deploy [DEPLOYABLES ...] [--bucket=BUCKET]
        [--image-url=IMAGE_URL] [--no-promote] [--no-stop-previous-version]
        [--version=VERSION, -v VERSION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    This command is used to deploy both code and configuration to the App
    Engine server. As an input it takes one or more DEPLOYABLES that should be
    uploaded. A DEPLOYABLE can be a service's .yaml file or a configuration's
    .yaml file (for more information about configuration files specific to your
    App Engine environment, refer to
    https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/configuration-files
    or
    https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/python/configuration-files).
    Note, for Java Standard apps, you must add the path to the
    appengine-web.xml file inside the WEB-INF directory. gcloud app deploy
    skips files specified in the .gcloudignore file (see gcloud topic
    gcloudignore for more information).

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     [DEPLOYABLES ...]
        The yaml files for the services or configurations you want to deploy.
        If not given, defaults to app.yaml in the current directory. If that is
        not found, attempts to automatically generate necessary configuration
        files (such as app.yaml) in the current directory.

FLAGS
     --bucket=BUCKET
        The Google Cloud Storage bucket used to stage files associated with the
        deployment. If this argument is not specified, the application's
        default code bucket is used.

     --image-url=IMAGE_URL
        Deploy with a specific Docker image. Docker url must be from one of the
        valid gcr hostnames.

     --promote
        Promote the deployed version to receive all traffic. Overrides the
        default app/promote_by_default property value for this command
        invocation. Use --no-promote to disable.

     --stop-previous-version
        Stop the previously running version when deploying a new version that
        receives all traffic. Overrides the default app/stop_previous_version
        property value for this command invocation. Use
        --no-stop-previous-version to disable.

     --version=VERSION, -v VERSION
        The version of the app that will be created or replaced by this
        deployment. If you do not specify a version, one will be generated for
        you.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To deploy a single service, run:

        $ gcloud app deploy ~/my_app/app.yaml

    To deploy an App Engine Standard Java service, run:

        $ gcloud app deploy ~/my_app/WEB-INF/appengine-web.xml

    By default, the service is deployed the current project configured via:

        $ gcloud config set core/project PROJECT

    To override this value for a single deployment, use the --project flag:

        $ gcloud app deploy ~/my_app/app.yaml --project=PROJECT

    To deploy multiple services, run:

        $ gcloud app deploy ~/my_app/app.yaml ~/my_app/another_service.yaml

    To change the default --promote behavior for your current environment, run:

        $ gcloud config set app/promote_by_default false

NOTES
    This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta app deploy
