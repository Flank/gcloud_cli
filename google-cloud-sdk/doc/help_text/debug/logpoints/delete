NAME
    gcloud debug logpoints delete - delete debug logpoints

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud debug logpoints delete [ID ...] [--all-users] [--include-inactive]
        [--location=LOCATION-REGEXP] [--target=(ID|DESCRIPTION_REGEXP)]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    This command deletes logpoints from a Cloud Debugger debug target. It will
    ask for confirmation before deleting any logpoints. To suppress
    confirmation, use the global --quiet option.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     [ID ...]
        Zero or more logpoint resource identifiers. The specified logpoints
        will be deleted.

FLAGS
     --all-users
        If set, any location regexp will match logpoints from all users, rather
        than only logpoints created by the current user. This flag is not
        required when specifying the exact ID of a logpoint created by another
        user.

     --include-inactive
        If set, any location regexp will also match inactive logpoints, rather
        than only logpoints which have not expired. This flag is not required
        when specifying the exact ID of an inactive logpoint.

     --location=LOCATION-REGEXP
        A regular expression to match against logpoint locations. All logpoints
        matching this value will be deleted. You may specify --location
        multiple times.

        EXAMPLE:

            gcloud debug logpoints delete \
                --location foo.py:[1-3] --location bar.py:4

     --target=(ID|DESCRIPTION_REGEXP)
        The debug target. It may be a target ID or name obtained from 'debug
        targets list', or it may be a regular expression uniquely specifying a
        debuggee based on its description or name. For App Engine projects, if
        not specified, the default target is the most recent deployment of the
        default module and version.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
