NAME
    gcloud debug snapshots delete - delete debug snapshots

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud debug snapshots delete [ID ...] [--all-users] [--include-inactive]
        [--location=LOCATION-REGEXP] [--target=(ID|DESCRIPTION_REGEXP)]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    This command deletes snapshots from a Cloud Debugger debug target. It will
    ask for confirmation before deleting any snapshots. To suppress
    confirmation, use the global --quiet option.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     [ID ...]
        Zero or more snapshot resource identifiers. The specified snapshots
        will be deleted.

FLAGS
     --all-users
        If set, matching snapshots from all users will be deleted, rather than
        only snapshots created by the current user.

     --include-inactive
        If set, also delete snapshots which have been completed. By default,
        only pending snapshots will be deleted.

     --location=LOCATION-REGEXP
        A regular expression to match against snapshot locations. All snapshots
        matching this value will be deleted. You may specify --location
        multiple times.

        EXAMPLE:

            gcloud debug snapshots delete \
                --location foo.py:[1-3] --location bar.py:4

     --target=(ID|DESCRIPTION_REGEXP)
        The debug target. It may be a target ID or name obtained from 'debug
        targets list', or it may be a regular expression uniquely specifying a
        debuggee based on its description or name. For App Engine projects, if
        not specified, the default target is the most recent deployment of the
        default module and version.
