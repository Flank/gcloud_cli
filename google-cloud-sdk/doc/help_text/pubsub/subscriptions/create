DESCRIPTION
    Creates one or more Cloud Pub/Sub subscriptions for a given topic. The new

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Subscription resource - One or more subscriptions to create. This
     represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the [project]
     attribute: provide the argument [subscription] on the command line with a
     fully specified name; provide the argument [--project] on the command
     line; set the property [core/project]. This must be specified.

       SUBSCRIPTION [SUBSCRIPTION ...]
          IDs of the subscriptions or fully qualified identifiers for the
          subscriptions.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Topic resource - Name of the topic from which this subscription is
     receiving messages. Each subscription is attached to a single topic. The
     arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. This must be specified.

       --topic=TOPIC
          ID of the topic or fully qualified identifier for the topic. This
          flag must be specified if any of the other arguments in this group
          are specified.

       --topic-project=TOPIC_PROJECT
          The Cloud project for the topic.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --ack-deadline=ACK_DEADLINE
        The number of seconds the system will wait for a subscriber to
        acknowledge receiving a message before re-attempting delivery.

     --push-endpoint=PUSH_ENDPOINT
        A URL to use as the endpoint for this subscription. This will also
        automatically set the subscription type to PUSH.
