DESCRIPTION
    Updates an existing Cloud Pub/Sub subscription.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Subscription resource - Name of the subscription to update. This
     represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the [project]
     attribute: provide the argument [subscription] on the command line with a
     fully specified name; provide the argument [--project] on the command
     line; set the property [core/project]. This must be specified.

       SUBSCRIPTION
          ID of the subscription or fully qualified identifier for the
          subscription.

FLAGS
     --ack-deadline=ACK_DEADLINE
        The number of seconds the system will wait for a subscriber to
        acknowledge receiving a message before re-attempting delivery.

     --expiration-period=EXPIRATION_PERIOD
        The subscription will expire if it is inactive for the given period.
        Valid values are strings of the form INTEGER[UNIT], where UNIT is one
        of "s", "m", "h", and "d" for seconds, minutes, hours, and days,
        respectively. If the unit is omitted, seconds is assumed. This flag
        additionally accepts the special value "never" to indicate that the
        subscription will never expire.

     --message-retention-duration=MESSAGE_RETENTION_DURATION
        How long to retain unacknowledged messages in the subscription's
        backlog, from the moment a message is published. If
        --retain-acked-messages is true, this also configures the retention of
        acknowledged messages. Specify "default" to use the default value.
        Valid values are strings of the form INTEGER[UNIT], where UNIT is one
        of "s", "m", "h", and "d" for seconds, minutes, hours, and days,
        respectively. If the unit is omitted, seconds is assumed.

     --push-endpoint=PUSH_ENDPOINT
        A URL to use as the endpoint for this subscription. This will also
        automatically set the subscription type to PUSH.

     --retain-acked-messages
        Whether or not to retain acknowledged messages. If true, messages are
        not expunged from the subscription's backlog until they fall out of the
        --message-retention-duration window.
