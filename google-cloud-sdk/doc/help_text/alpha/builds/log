NAME
    gcloud alpha builds log - stream the logs for a build

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha builds log BUILD [--stream] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Stream the logs for a build.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     BUILD
        The build whose logs shall be printed. The ID of the build is printed
        at the end of the build submission process, or in the ID column when
        listing builds.

FLAGS
     --stream
        If a build is ongoing, stream the logs to stdout until the build
        completes.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access whitelist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud builds log
        $ gcloud beta builds log
