DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Create a worker pool for use by Google Cloud Build.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       Command-line flags to configure the WorkerPool:

         WORKER_POOL
            The WorkerPool to create. This positional must be specified if any
            of the other arguments in this group are specified.

         --regions=[REGION,...]
            The Cloud region or regions in which to create the WorkerPool.
            REGION must be one of: us-central1, us-east1, us-east4, us-west1.

         --worker-count=WORKER_COUNT
            Total number of workers to be created across all requested regions.

         Configuration to be used for creating workers in the WorkerPool:

           --worker-disk-size=WORKER_DISK_SIZE
              Size of the disk attached to the worker.

              If not given, Cloud Build will use a standard disk size.
              --worker-disk-size is overridden if you specify a different disk
              size using --disk-size during gcloud builds submit.

           --worker-machine-type=WORKER_MACHINE_TYPE
              Machine Type of the worker, such as n1-standard-1.

              See https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types.

              If left blank, Cloud Build will use a standard unspecified
              machine to create the worker pool.

              --worker-machine-type is overridden if you specify a different
              machine type using --machine-type during gcloud builds submit.

           --worker-tag=WORKER_TAG
              The tag applied to the worker, and the same tag used by the
              firewall rule.

              It is used to identify the Cloud Build workers among other VMs.
              The default value for tag is worker.

           The network definition used to create the worker. If all of these
           flags are unused, the workers will be created in the WorkerPool's
           project on the default network. You cannot specify just one of these
           flags: it is all or none. However, you can set them to the empty
           string in order to use the default settings.

             --worker-network-name=WORKER_NETWORK_NAME
                Network on which the workers are created.

                default network is used if empty string.

             --worker-network-project=WORKER_NETWORK_PROJECT
                ID of the project containing the given network and subnet.

                The workerpool's project is used if empty string.

             --worker-network-subnet=WORKER_NETWORK_SUBNET
                Subnet on which the workers are created.

                default subnet is used if empty string.

       --config-from-file=CONFIG_FROM_FILE
          A file that contains the configuration for the WorkerPool to be
          created.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access whitelist.
