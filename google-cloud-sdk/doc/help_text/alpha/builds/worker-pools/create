DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Create a worker pool for use by Google Cloud Build.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       Command-line flags to configure the WorkerPool:

         WORKER_POOL
            The unique identifier for the custom worker pool to create. This
            value should be 1-63 characters, and valid characters are
            [a-z][0-9]- This positional must be specified if any of the other
            arguments in this group are specified.

         --peered-network=PEERED_NETWORK
            VPC network to which workers are peered.

            If not specified, the workers are not peered to any network.

         --region=REGION
            The Cloud region where the WorkerPool is.

         Configuration to be used for creating workers in the WorkerPool:

           --worker-disk-size=WORKER_DISK_SIZE
              Size of the disk attached to the worker.

              If not given, Cloud Build will use a standard disk size.

           --worker-machine-type=WORKER_MACHINE_TYPE
              Compute Engine machine type for a worker pool.

              For information on supported machine types, see
              https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/custom-workers/worker-pool-config-file.

              If unspecified, Cloud Build uses a standard machine type.

       --config-from-file=CONFIG_FROM_FILE
          A file that contains the configuration for the WorkerPool to be
          created.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:
