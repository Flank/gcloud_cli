DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Update a worker pool used by Google Cloud Build.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       Command-line flags to configure the WorkerPool:

         WORKER_POOL
            The WorkerPool to update. This positional must be specified if any
            of the other arguments in this group are specified.

         --peered-network=PEERED_NETWORK
            Network which workers are peered to.

            default network is used if empty string.

         --region=REGION
            The Cloud region where the WorkerPool is.

         Configuration to be used for creating workers in the WorkerPool:

           --worker-disk-size=WORKER_DISK_SIZE
              Size of the disk attached to the worker.

              If not given, Cloud Build will use a standard disk size.

           --worker-machine-type=WORKER_MACHINE_TYPE
              Machine Type of the worker, such as n1-standard-1.

              See https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types.

              If left blank, Cloud Build will use a standard unspecified
              machine to create the worker pool.

       --config-from-file=CONFIG_FROM_FILE
          A file that contains updates to the configuration for the WorkerPool.
