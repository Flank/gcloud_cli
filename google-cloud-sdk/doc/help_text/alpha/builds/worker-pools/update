DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Update a worker pool used by Google Cloud Build.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       Command-line flags to configure the WorkerPool:

         WORKER_POOL
            The WorkerPool to update. This positional must be specified if any
            of the other arguments in this group are specified.

         --worker-count=WORKER_COUNT
            Total number of workers to be created across all requested regions.

         Update the Cloud region or regions in which the Workerpool is located.
         To overwrite regions, use --clear-regions followed by --add-regions in
         the same command. Choices: us-central1, us-west1, us-east1, and
         us-east4.

           --add-regions=[REGION,...]
              Add regions, separated by comma.

           --clear-regions
              Remove all regions.

           --remove-regions=[REGION,...]
              Remove regions, separated by comma.

         Configuration to be used for creating workers in the WorkerPool:

           --worker-disk-size=WORKER_DISK_SIZE
              Size of the disk attached to the worker.

              If not given, Cloud Build will use a standard disk size.
              --worker-disk-size is overridden if you specify a different disk
              size using --disk-size during gcloud builds submit.

           --worker-machine-type=WORKER_MACHINE_TYPE
              Machine Type of the worker, such as n1-standard-1.

              See https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types.

              If left blank, Cloud Build will use a standard unspecified
              machine to create the worker pool.

              --worker-machine-type is overridden if you specify a different
              machine type using --machine-type during gcloud builds submit.

           --worker-tag=WORKER_TAG
              The tag applied to the worker, and the same tag used by the
              firewall rule.

              It is used to identify the Cloud Build workers among other VMs.
              The default value for tag is worker.

           The network definition used to create the worker. If all of these
           flags are unused, the workers will be created in the WorkerPool's
           project on the default network. You cannot specify just one of these
           flags: it is all or none. However, you can set them to the empty
           string in order to use the default settings.

             --worker-network-name=WORKER_NETWORK_NAME
                Network on which the workers are created.

                default network is used if empty string.

             --worker-network-project=WORKER_NETWORK_PROJECT
                ID of the project containing the given network and subnet.

                The workerpool's project is used if empty string.

             --worker-network-subnet=WORKER_NETWORK_SUBNET
                Subnet on which the workers are created.

                default subnet is used if empty string.

       --config-from-file=CONFIG_FROM_FILE
          A file that contains updates to the configuration for the WorkerPool.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
    https://cloud.google.com/support/.
