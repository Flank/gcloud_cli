NAME
    gcloud alpha builds triggers export - export a build trigger

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha builds triggers export TRIGGER --destination=PATH
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Export a build trigger.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Trigger resource - Build Trigger. This represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE)
     Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in
     other ways. To set the [project] attribute: provide the argument [TRIGGER]
     on the command line with a fully specified name; provide the argument
     [--project] on the command line; set the property [core/project]. This
     must be specified.

       TRIGGER
          ID of the trigger or fully qualified identifier for the trigger.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --destination=PATH
        File path where trigger should be exported.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To export a trigger to a file called trigger.yaml:

        $ gcloud alpha builds triggers export my-trigger \
            --destination=trigger.yaml

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta builds triggers export
