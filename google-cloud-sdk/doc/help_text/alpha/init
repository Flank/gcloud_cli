NAME
    gcloud alpha init - initialize or reinitialize gcloud

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha init [--console-only] [--skip-diagnostics]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha init launches an interactive Getting Started workflow
    for the gcloud command-line tool. It performs the following setup steps:

      o Authorizes gcloud and other SDK tools to access Google Cloud Platform
        using your user account credentials, or from an account of your
        choosing whose credentials are already available.
      o Sets up a new or existing configuration.
      o Sets properties in that configuration, including the current project
        and optionally, the default Google Compute Engine region and zone you'd
        like to use.

    gcloud alpha init can be used for initial setup of gcloud and to create new
    or reinitialize gcloud configurations. More information about
    configurations can be found by running gcloud topic configurations.

    Properties set by gcloud alpha init are local and persistent, and are not
    affected by remote changes to the project. For example, the default Compute
    Engine zone in your configuration remains stable, even if you or another
    user changes the project-level default zone in the Cloud Platform Console.

    To sync the configuration, re-run gcloud alpha init.

FLAGS
     --console-only
        Prevent the command from launching a browser for authorization.

     --skip-diagnostics
        Do not run diagnostics.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud init
        $ gcloud beta init
