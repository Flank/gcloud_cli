NAME
    gcloud alpha iot devices configs list - list configs for a device

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha iot devices configs list
        (--device=DEVICE : --region=REGION --registry=REGISTRY)
        [--filter=EXPRESSION] [--limit=LIMIT] [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE]
        [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) This command lists all available configurations in the history of
    the device. Up to 10 are kept; you may restrict the output to fewer via the
    --limit flag.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Device resource - The device you want to list the configs for. The
     arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways. To set the [project] attribute: provide the flag
     [--device] on the command line with a fully specified name; provide the
     flag [--project] on the command line; set the property [core/project].
     This must be specified.

       --device=DEVICE
          The ID of the device or a fully qualified identifier for the device.
          This flag must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
          group are specified.

       --region=REGION
          The name of the Cloud IoT region.

       --registry=REGISTRY
          The name of the Cloud IoT registry.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        The maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        A comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.
