NAME
    gcloud alpha iot registries set-iam-policy - set IAM policy for a device
        registry

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha iot registries set-iam-policy (REGISTRY : --region=REGION)
        POLICY_FILE [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) This command replaces the existing IAM policy for a device
    registry, given a REGISTRY and a file encoded in JSON or YAML that contains
    the IAM policy. If the given policy file specifies an "etag" value, then
    the replacement will succeed only if the policy already in place matches
    that etag. (An etag obtained via $ gcloud iot registries get-iam-policy
    will prevent the replacement if the policy for the device registry has been
    subsequently updated.) A policy file that does not contain an etag value
    will replace any existing policy for the device registry.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     REGISTRY - The device registry for which to set IAM policy. The arguments
     in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource.
     (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be
     set in other ways. To set the [project] attribute: Set the property
     [core/project] or provide the flag [--project] on the command line. This
     must be specified.

       REGISTRY
          The ID of the registry or a fully qualified identifier for the
          registry. This positional must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --region=REGION
          The Cloud region for the registry.

     POLICY_FILE

            my-registry policy.json
