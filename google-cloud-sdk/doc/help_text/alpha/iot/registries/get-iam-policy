NAME
    gcloud alpha iot registries get-iam-policy - get the IAM policy for a
        device registry

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha iot registries get-iam-policy (REGISTRY : --region=REGION)
        [--filter=EXPRESSION] [--limit=LIMIT] [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE]
        [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) This command gets the IAM policy for a device registry. If
    formatted as JSON, the output can be edited and used as a policy file for
    set-iam-policy. The output includes an "etag" field identifying the version
    emitted and allowing detection of concurrent policy updates; see $ gcloud
    iot registries set-iam-policy for additional details.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Registry resource - The device registry for which to display the IAM
     policy. The arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes
     of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this
     group but can be set in other ways. To set the [project] attribute: Set
     the property [core/project] or provide the flag [--project] on the command
     line. This must be specified.

       REGISTRY
          The ID of the registry or a fully qualified identifier for the
          registry. This positional must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --region=REGION
          The name of the Cloud IoT region.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        The maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        A comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.
