NAME
    gcloud alpha container node-pools delete - delete an existing node pool in
        a running cluster

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha container node-pools delete NAME [--async] [--cluster=CLUSTER]
        [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE, -z ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha container node-pools delete deletes a node pool from a
    Google Kubernetes Engine cluster. This command does not gracefully drain
    the nodes prior to deleting them. Use "kubectl drain NODE_NAME" to drain
    each node to have containers running on these nodes terminate gracefully.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        The name of the node pool to delete.

FLAGS
     --async
        Don't wait for the operation to complete.

     --cluster=CLUSTER
        The cluster from which to delete the node pool. Overrides the default
        container/cluster property value for this command invocation.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Compute region (e.g. us-central1) for the cluster.

       --zone=ZONE, -z ZONE
          Compute zone (e.g. us-central1-a) for the cluster. Overrides the
          default compute/zone property value for this command invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

EXAMPLES
    To delete the "node-pool-1" node pool from the cluster "sample-cluster",
    run:

        $ gcloud alpha container node-pools delete node-pool-1 \
            --cluster=sample-cluster

    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at

        $ gcloud container node-pools delete
