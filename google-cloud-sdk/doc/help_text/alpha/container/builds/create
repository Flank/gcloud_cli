NAME
    gcloud alpha container builds create - create a build using the Google
        Container Builder service

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha container builds create [[SOURCE] --no-source]
        (--config=CONFIG | --tag=TAG, -t TAG) [--async] [--disk-size=DISK_SIZE]
        [--gcs-log-dir=GCS_LOG_DIR]
        [--gcs-source-staging-dir=GCS_SOURCE_STAGING_DIR]
        [--machine-type=MACHINE_TYPE] [--substitutions=[KEY=VALUE,...]]
        [--timeout=TIMEOUT] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Create a build using the Google Container Builder service.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     At most one of these may be specified:

       [SOURCE]
          The source directory on local disk or tarball in Google Cloud Storage
          or disk to use for this build. If source is a local directory this
          command skips files specified in the .gcloudignore file (see $ gcloud
          topic gcloudignore for more information). If a .gitignore file is
          present in the local source directory, gcloud will use a
          Git-compatible .gcloudignore file that respects your .gitignore-ed
          files. The global .gitignore is not respected.

       --no-source
          Specify that no source should be uploaded with this build.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --config=CONFIG
          The .yaml or .json file to use for build configuration.

       --tag=TAG, -t TAG
          The tag to use with a "docker build" image creation. The Container
          Builder service will run a remote "docker build -t $TAG .", where
          $TAG is the tag provided by this flag. The tag must be in the
          gcr.io/* or *.gcr.io/* namespaces.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Display information about the operation in progress, without waiting
        for the operation to complete.

     --disk-size=DISK_SIZE
        Machine disk size (GB) to run the build.

     --gcs-log-dir=GCS_LOG_DIR
        Directory in Google Cloud Storage to hold build logs. If not set,
        gs://<project num>.cloudbuild-logs.googleusercontent.com/ will be
        created and used.

     --gcs-source-staging-dir=GCS_SOURCE_STAGING_DIR
        Directory in Google Cloud Storage to stage a copy of the source used
        for the build. If the bucket does not exist, it will be created. If not
        set, gs://<project id>_cloudbuild/source is used.

     --machine-type=MACHINE_TYPE
        Machine type used to run the build. MACHINE_TYPE must be one of:
        n1-highcpu-32, n1-highcpu-8.

     --substitutions=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        Parameters to be substituted in the build specification.

        For example (using some nonsensical substitution keys; all keys must
        begin with an underscore):

            $ gcloud container builds submit . \
                --config config.yaml \
                --substitutions _FAVORITE_COLOR=blue,_NUM_CANDIES=10

        This will result in a build where every occurrence of
        ${_FAVORITE_COLOR} in certain fields is replaced by "blue", and
        similarly for ${_NUM_CANDIES} and "10".

        Only the following built-in variables can be specified with the
        --substitutions flag: REPO_NAME, BRANCH_NAME, TAG_NAME, REVISION_ID,
        COMMIT_SHA, SHORT_SHA.

        For more details, see:
        https://cloud.google.com/container-builder/docs/api/build-requests#substitutions

     --timeout=TIMEOUT
        Maximum time a build can last before it is failed as "TIMEOUT", written
        as a duration (eg "2h15m5s" is two hours, fifteen minutes, and five
        seconds). If no unit is specified, seconds is assumed (eg "10" is 10
        seconds). Overrides the default container/build_timeout property value
        for this command invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is an internal implementation detail and may change or
    disappear without notice. This command is currently in ALPHA and may change
    without notice. Usually, users of ALPHA commands and flags need to apply
    for access, agree to applicable terms, and have their projects whitelisted.
