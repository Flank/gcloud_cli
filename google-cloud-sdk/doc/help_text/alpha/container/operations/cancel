NAME
    gcloud alpha container operations cancel - cancel a running operation

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha container operations cancel OPERATION_ID
        [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE, -z ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Cancel a running operation.

    Cancel is a best-effort method for aborting a running operation. Operations
    that have already completed can not be cancelled. If the operation has
    passed the "point of no-return", cancel will have no effect.

    An example of "point of no-return" in the context of Upgrade operations
    would be if all the nodes have been upgraded but the operation hasn't been
    marked as complete.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     OPERATION_ID
        The operation id to cancel.

FLAGS
     At most one of these may be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Compute region (e.g. us-central1) for the cluster.

       --zone=ZONE, -z ZONE
          Compute zone (e.g. us-central1-a) for the cluster. Overrides the
          default compute/zone property value for this command invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To cancel an operation, run:

        $ gcloud alpha container operations cancel sample-operation-id

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access whitelist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta container operations cancel
