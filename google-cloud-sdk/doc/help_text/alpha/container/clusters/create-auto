DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA)

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        The name of the cluster to create.

        The name may contain only lowercase alphanumerics and '-', must start
        with a letter and end with an alphanumeric, and must be no longer than
        40 characters.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --cluster-ipv4-cidr=CLUSTER_IPV4_CIDR
        The IP address range for the pods in this cluster in CIDR notation
        (e.g. 10.0.0.0/14). Prior to Kubernetes version 1.7.0 this must be a
        subset of 10.0.0.0/8; however, starting with version 1.7.0 can be any
        RFC 1918 IP range.

     --cluster-secondary-range-name=NAME
        Set the secondary range to be used as the source for pod IPs. Alias
        ranges will be allocated from this secondary range. NAME must be the
        name of an existing secondary range in the cluster subnetwork.

        Must be used in conjunction with '--enable-ip-alias'. Cannot be used
        with --create-subnetwork.

     --create-subnetwork=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        Create a new subnetwork for the cluster. The name and range of the
        subnetwork can be customized via optional 'name' and 'range' key-value
        pairs.

        'name' specifies the name of the subnetwork to be created.

        'range' specifies the IP range for the new subnetwork. This can either
        be a netmask size (e.g. '/20') or a CIDR range (e.g. '10.0.0.0/20'). If
        a netmask size is specified, the IP is automatically taken from the
        free space in the cluster's network.

        Examples:

        Create a new subnetwork with a default name and size.

            $ gcloud alpha container clusters create-auto --create-subnetwork ""

        Create a new subnetwork named "my-subnet" with netmask of size 21.

            $ gcloud alpha container clusters create-auto \
            --create-subnetwork name=my-subnet,range=/21

        Create a new subnetwork with a default name with the primary range of
        10.100.0.0/16.

            $ gcloud alpha container clusters create-auto \
            --create-subnetwork range=10.100.0.0/16

        Create a new subnetwork with the name "my-subnet" with a default range.

            $ gcloud alpha container clusters create-auto \
            --create-subnetwork name=my-subnet

        Can not be specified unless '--enable-ip-alias' is also specified. Can
        not be used in conjunction with the '--subnetwork' option.

     --network=NETWORK
        The Compute Engine Network that the cluster will connect to. Google
        Kubernetes Engine will use this network when creating routes and
        firewalls for the clusters. Defaults to the 'default' network.

     --release-channel=CHANNEL
        Release channel a cluster is subscribed to.

        When a cluster is subscribed to a release channel, Google maintains
        both the master version and the node version. Node auto-upgrade
        defaults to true and cannot be disabled.

        CHANNEL must be one of:

         rapid
            'rapid' channel is offered on an early access basis for customers
            who want to test new releases.

            WARNING: Versions available in the 'rapid' channel may be subject
            to unresolved issues with no known workaround and are not subject
            to any SLAs.

         regular
            Clusters subscribed to 'regular' receive versions that are
            considered GA quality. 'regular' is intended for production users
            who want to take advantage of new features.

         stable
            Clusters subscribed to 'stable' receive versions that are known to
            be stable and reliable in production.

     --services-ipv4-cidr=CIDR
        Set the IP range for the services IPs.

        Can be specified as a netmask size (e.g. '/20') or as in CIDR notion
        (e.g. '10.100.0.0/20'). If given as a netmask size, the IP range will
        be chosen automatically from the available space in the network.

        If unspecified, the services CIDR range will be chosen with a default
        mask size.

        Can not be specified unless '--enable-ip-alias' is also specified.

     --services-secondary-range-name=NAME
        Set the secondary range to be used for services (e.g. ClusterIPs). NAME
        must be the name of an existing secondary range in the cluster
        subnetwork.

        Must be used in conjunction with '--enable-ip-alias'. Cannot be used
        with --create-subnetwork.

     --subnetwork=SUBNETWORK
        The Google Compute Engine subnetwork
        (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/subnetworks) to which the
        cluster is connected. The subnetwork must belong to the network
        specified by --network.

        Cannot be used with the "--create-subnetwork" option.

     Master Authorized Networks

       --enable-master-authorized-networks
          Allow only specified set of CIDR blocks (specified by the
          --master-authorized-networks flag) to connect to Kubernetes master
          through HTTPS. Besides these blocks, the following have access as
          well:

              1) The private network the cluster connects to if
              `--enable-private-nodes` is specified.
              2) Google Compute Engine Public IPs if `--enable-private-nodes` is not
              specified.

          Use --no-enable-master-authorized-networks to disable. When disabled,
          public internet (0.0.0.0/0) is allowed to connect to Kubernetes
          master through HTTPS.

       --master-authorized-networks=NETWORK,[NETWORK,...]
          The list of CIDR blocks (up to 100 for private cluster, 50 for public
          cluster) that are allowed to connect to Kubernetes master through
          HTTPS. Specified in CIDR notation (e.g. 1.2.3.4/30). Cannot be
          specified unless --enable-master-authorized-networks is also
          specified.

     Private Clusters

       --enable-private-endpoint
          Cluster is managed using the private IP address of the master API
          endpoint.

       --master-ipv4-cidr=MASTER_IPV4_CIDR
          IPv4 CIDR range to use for the master network. This should have a
          netmask of size /28 and should be used in conjunction with the
          --enable-private-nodes flag.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Compute region (e.g. us-central1) for the cluster.

       --zone=ZONE, -z ZONE
          Compute zone (e.g. us-central1-a) for the cluster. Overrides the
          default compute/zone property value for this command invocation.

     Options to specify the node identity.

       Scopes options.

         --scopes=[SCOPE,...]; default="gke-default"
            Specifies scopes for the node instances. Examples:

                $ gcloud alpha container clusters create-auto example-cluster \
                    --scopes=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_only

                $ gcloud alpha container clusters create-auto example-cluster \
                    --scopes=bigquery,storage-rw,compute-ro

            Multiple SCOPEs can be specified, separated by commas.
            logging-write and/or monitoring are added unless Cloud Logging
            and/or Cloud Monitoring are disabled (see --enable-cloud-logging
            and --enable-cloud-monitoring for more information). SCOPE can be
            either the full URI of the scope or an alias. default scopes are
            assigned to all instances. Available aliases are:

NOTES
    This command is an internal implementation detail and may change or
    disappear without notice. This command is currently in ALPHA and may change
    without notice. If this command fails with API permission errors despite
