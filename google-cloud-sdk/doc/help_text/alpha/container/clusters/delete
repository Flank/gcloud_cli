NAME
    gcloud alpha container clusters delete - delete an existing cluster for
        running containers

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha container clusters delete NAME [NAME ...] [--async]
        [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE, -z ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) When you delete a cluster, the following resources are deleted:

      o The master resources
      o All of the node instances in the cluster
      o Any Pods that are running on those instances
      o Any firewalls and routes created by Kubernetes Engine at the time of
        cluster creation
      o Data stored in host hostPath and emptyDir volumes

    The following resources are not deleted:

      o External load balancers created by the cluster
      o Persistent disk volumes

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME [NAME ...]
        The names of the clusters to delete.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Compute region (e.g. us-central1) for the cluster.

       --zone=ZONE, -z ZONE
          Compute zone (e.g. us-central1-a) for the cluster. Overrides the
          default compute/zone property value for this command invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To delete an existing cluster, run:

        $ gcloud alpha container clusters delete sample-cluster

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud container clusters delete
        $ gcloud beta container clusters delete
