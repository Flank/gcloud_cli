      o All of the node instances in the cluster
      o Any Pods that are running on those instances
      o Any firewalls and routes created by Kubernetes Engine at the time of
        cluster creation

    The following resources are not deleted:

      o External load balancers created by the cluster

     NAME [NAME ...]
        The names of the clusters to delete.

       --zone=ZONE, -z ZONE
          Compute zone (e.g. us-central1-a) for the cluster. Overrides the
          default compute/zone property value for this command invocation.

    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
