NAME
    gcloud alpha container clusters resize - resizes an existing cluster for
        running containers

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha container clusters resize NAME --size=SIZE [--async]
        [--node-pool=NODE_POOL] [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE, -z ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Resize an existing cluster to a provided size.

    If you have multiple node pools, you must specify which node pool to resize
    by using the --node-pool flag. You are not required to use the flag if you
    have a single node pool.

    When increasing the size of a container cluster, the new instances are
    created with the same configuration as the existing instances. Existing
    pods are not moved onto the new instances, but new pods (such as those
    created by resizing a replication controller) will be scheduled onto the
    new instances.

    When decreasing a cluster, the nodes are drained. As a result, the pods
    running on these nodes are gracefully terminated. If your pods are being
    managed by a workload controller, the controller will attempt to reschedule
    them onto the remaining instances. If your pods are not managed by a
    workload controller, they will not be restarted. Note that when resizing
    down, instances running pods and instances without pods are not
    differentiated. Resize will pick instances to remove at random.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        The name of this cluster.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --size=SIZE
        Target number of nodes in the cluster.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Don't wait for the operation to complete.

     --node-pool=NODE_POOL
        The node pool to resize.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --region=REGION
          The compute region (e.g. us-central1) for the cluster.

       --zone=ZONE, -z ZONE
          The compute zone (e.g. us-central1-a) for the cluster. Overrides the
          default compute/zone property value for this command invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. Usually,
    users of ALPHA commands and flags need to apply for access, agree to
    applicable terms, and have their projects whitelisted. Contact Google or
    sign up on a product's page for ALPHA access. Product pages can be found at
