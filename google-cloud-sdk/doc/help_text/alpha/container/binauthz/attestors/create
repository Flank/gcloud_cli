        [--description=DESCRIPTION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Create an Attestor.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Attestor resource - The attestor to be created. This represents a Cloud
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways. To set the [project] attribute: provide the flag
     [ATTESTOR] on the command line with a fully specified name; provide the
     flag [--project] on the command line; set the property [core/project].
     This must be specified.

       ATTESTOR
          The ID of the attestor or a fully qualified identifier for the
          attestor.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Note resource - The Container Analysis ATTESTATION_AUTHORITY Note to which
     the created attestor will be bound.

    For the attestor to be able to access and use the Note, the Note must exist
    and the active gcloud account (core/account) must have the
    containeranalysis.occurrences.viewer permission for the Note. This can be
    achieved by granting the containeranalysis.notes.viewer role to the active
    account for the Note resource in question.

        The arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. This must be specified.

         --attestation-authority-note=ATTESTATION_AUTHORITY_NOTE
            The ID of the note or a fully qualified identifier for the note.
            This flag must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
            group are specified.

         --attestation-authority-note-project=ATTESTATION_AUTHORITY_NOTE_PROJECT
            The Container Analysis project for the note.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        A description for the attestor

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,

    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
