NAME
    gcloud alpha container binauthz attestations list - list Binary
        Authorization attestations

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha container binauthz attestations list
        [--artifact-url=ARTIFACT_URL]
        [--attestation-authority-note=ATTESTATION_AUTHORITY_NOTE
          : --attestation-authority-note-project=ATTESTATION_AUTHORITY_NOTE_PROJECT]
        [--filter=EXPRESSION] [--limit=LIMIT] [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE]
        [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]] [--uri] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) This command lists Binary Authorization attestations for your
    project. Command line flags specify which artifact to list the attestations
    for. If no artifact is specified, then this lists all URLs with associated
    occurrences.

    To list attestations with kind=ATTESTATION_AUTHORITY (v2), the attestation
    authority note ID must be passed with the flag --attestation-
    authority-note-id. In this mode, only attestations bound to the provided
    note will be listed. The returned attestation occurrences can be from any
    project, so the global --project flag is not required (or used) in this
    mode.

    To list attestations with kind=BUILD_DETAILS (v1, soon to be deprecated),
    the global --project flag must be provided (or implicitly provided from
    configuration). In this mode, note that listed occurrences might include
    more than just attestations, since it is listing any occurrence at all that
    has the provided --artifact-url. All listed occurrences will be from the
    provided project.

FLAGS
     --artifact-url=ARTIFACT_URL
        Container URL. May be in the .gcr.io/repository/image format, or may
        optionally contain the http or https scheme

     ATTESTATION AUTHORITY NOTE - The Container Analysis ATTESTATION_AUTHORITY
     Note that will be queried for attestations. When this option is passed,
     only occurrences with kind ATTESTATION_AUTHORITY will be returned. The
     occurrences might be from any project, not just the project where the note
     lives. Note that the caller must have the
     containeranalysis.notes.listOccurrences permission on the note being
     queried. The arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes
     of this resource.

       --attestation-authority-note=ATTESTATION_AUTHORITY_NOTE
          The ID of the note or a fully qualified identifier for the note. This
          flag must be specified if any of the other arguments in this group
          are specified.

       --attestation-authority-note-project=ATTESTATION_AUTHORITY_NOTE_PROJECT
          The Container Analysis provider project for the note.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        The maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        A comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --uri
        Print a list of resource URIs instead of the default output.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    List all artifact URLs for which a v2 attestation exists and is bound to
    the passed attestation authority note:

        $ gcloud alpha container binauthz attestations list \
            --attestation-authority-note=providers/example-prj/notes/note-id

    List the (pgp_key_fingerprint, signature) pairs for all v2 attestations for
    the passed artifact-url bound to the passed attestation authority note:

        $ gcloud alpha container binauthz attestations list \
            --attestation-authority-note=providers/exmple-prj/notes/note-id \
            --artifact-url='gcr.io/example-project/example-image@sha256:abcd'

    List all artifact URLs for which an v1 attestation exists in the passed
    project:

        $ gcloud alpha container binauthz attestations list \
          --project=example-project

    List the (public_key, signature) pairs for all v1 attestations in the
    passed project:

        $ gcloud alpha container binauthz attestations list \
            --project=example-project \
            --artifact-url='gcr.io/example-project/example-image@sha256:abcd'
