DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) This command lists Binary Authorization attestations for your
    project. Command line flags specify which artifact to list the attestations
    for. If no artifact is specified, then this lists all URLs with associated
    occurrences.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       Authority resource - The Attestation Authority whose Container Analysis
       Note will be queried for attestations. Note that the caller must have
       the containeranalysis.notes.listOccurrences permission on the note being
       queried. The arguments in this group can be used to specify the
       attributes of this resource.

         --attestation-authority=ATTESTATION_AUTHORITY
            The ID of the authority or a fully qualified identifier for the
            authority. This flag must be specified if any of the other
            arguments in this group are specified.

         --attestation-authority-project=ATTESTATION_AUTHORITY_PROJECT
            The Cloud project for the authority.

       Note resource - The Container Analysis ATTESTATION_AUTHORITY Note that
       will be queried for attestations. When this option is passed, only
       occurrences with kind ATTESTATION_AUTHORITY will be returned. The
       occurrences might be from any project, not just the project where the
       note lives. Note that the caller must have the
       containeranalysis.notes.listOccurrences permission on the note being
       queried. The arguments in this group can be used to specify the
       attributes of this resource.

         --attestation-authority-note=ATTESTATION_AUTHORITY_NOTE
            The ID of the note or a fully qualified identifier for the note.
            This flag must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
            group are specified.

         --attestation-authority-note-project=ATTESTATION_AUTHORITY_NOTE_PROJECT
            The Container Analysis project for the note.

FLAGS
     --artifact-url=ARTIFACT_URL
        Container URL. May be in the .gcr.io/repository/image format, or may
        optionally contain the http or https scheme

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        The maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        A comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --uri
        Print a list of resource URIs instead of the default output.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    List all artifact URLs for which an attestation exists and is bound to the
    passed attestation authority:

        $ gcloud alpha container binauthz attestations list \
            --attestation-authority=projects/foo/attestationAuthorities/bar

    List the (pgp_key_fingerprint, signature) pairs for all attestations for
    the passed artifact-url bound to the passed attestation authority:

        $ gcloud alpha container binauthz attestations list \
            --attestation-authority=projects/foo/attestationAuthorities/bar \
            --artifact-url='gcr.io/foo/example-image@sha256:abcd'
