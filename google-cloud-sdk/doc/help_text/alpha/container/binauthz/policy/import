    alpha container binauthz policy import.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     POLICY_FILE
        The file containing the YAML-formatted policy description.

FLAGS
     --strict-validation
        Whether to perform additional checks on the validity of policy
        contents.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLE
    One way of updating the current project's policy is to run:

        $ gcloud alpha container binauthz policy export > my_policy.yaml
        $ edit my_policy.yaml
        $ gcloud alpha container binauthz policy import \
          --policy-file=my_policy.yaml

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at

        $ gcloud beta container binauthz policy import
