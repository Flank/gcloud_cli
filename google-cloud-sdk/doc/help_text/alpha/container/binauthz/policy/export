NAME
    gcloud alpha container binauthz policy export - export the Binary
        Authorization policy for the current project

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha container binauthz policy export [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) This function's default output is a valid policy YAML file. If
    dumped to a file and edited, the new policy can be provided to the $ gcloud
    alpha container binauthz policy import command to cause these edits to be
    reflected in the project policy.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

EXAMPLE
    One way of updating the current project's policy is to run:

        $ gcloud alpha container binauthz policy export > my_policy.yaml
        $ edit my_policy.yaml
        $ gcloud alpha container binauthz policy import \
          --policy-file=my_policy.yaml

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
    https://cloud.google.com/support/. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta container binauthz policy export
