NAME
    gcloud alpha container binauthz policy export - export the Binary
        Authorization policy for the current project

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha container binauthz policy export [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) This function's default output is a valid policy YAML file. If
    dumped to a file and edited, the new policy can be provided to the $ gcloud
    alpha container binauthz policy import command to cause these edits to be
    reflected in the project policy.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLE
    One way of updating the current project's policy is to run:

        $ gcloud alpha container binauthz policy export > my_policy.yaml
        $ edit my_policy.yaml
        $ gcloud alpha container binauthz policy import \
          --policy-file=my_policy.yaml

NOTES
    This command is an internal implementation detail and may change or
    disappear without notice. This command is currently in ALPHA and may change
    without notice. Usually, users of ALPHA commands and flags need to apply
    for access, agree to applicable terms, and have their projects whitelisted.
