NAME
    gcloud alpha container binauthz policy remove-iam-policy-binding - remove
        IAM policy binding of a Binary Authorization policy

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha container binauthz policy remove-iam-policy-binding
        --member=MEMBER --role=ROLE
        [--all | --condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          | --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Remove an IAM policy binding from the IAM policy of a Binary
    Authorization policy. One binding consists of a member, a role, and an
    optional condition.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --member=MEMBER
        The member to remove the binding for. Should be of the form
        user|group|serviceAccount:email or domain:domain.

        Examples: user:test-user@gmail.com, group:admins@example.com,
        serviceAccount:test123@example.domain.com, or
        domain:example.domain.com.

        Can also be one of the following special values:
        * allUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone who is on the
          internet, with or without a Google account.
        * allAuthenticatedUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone
          who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account.

     --role=ROLE
        The role to remove the member from.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     At most one of these may be specified:

       --all
          Remove all bindings with this role and member, irrespective of any
          conditions.

       --condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          Condition of the binding to be removed. When condition is explicitly
          specified as None (e.g. --condition=None), it matches a binding
          without a condition. Otherwise, only the binding with a condition
          which exactly matches the specified condition (including the optional
          description) will be removed.

       expression
          (Required) Expression of the condition which evaluates to True or
          False. This uses a subset of Common Expression Language syntax.

       title
          (Required) Title for the expression, i.e. a short string describing
          its purpose.

       description
          (Optional) Description for the expression. This is a longer text
          which describes the expression.

          NOTE: An unsatisfied condition will not allow access via this
          binding.

       --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE
          Path to a local JSON or YAML file that defines the condition. To see
          available fields, see the help for --condition.

    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
