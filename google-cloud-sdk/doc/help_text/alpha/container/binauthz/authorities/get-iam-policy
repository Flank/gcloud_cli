NAME
    gcloud alpha container binauthz authorities get-iam-policy - get the IAM

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha container binauthz authorities get-iam-policy AUTHORITY
        [--filter=EXPRESSION] [--limit=LIMIT] [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE]
        [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]] [--uri] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Returns an empty policy if the resource does not have an existing
    IAM policy set.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Authority resource - The authority whose IAM policy will be fetched. This
     represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the [project]
     attribute: provide the flag [AUTHORITY] on the command line with a fully
     specified name; provide the flag [--project] on the command line; set the
     property [core/project]. This must be specified.

       AUTHORITY
          The ID of the authority or a fully qualified identifier for the
          authority.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        The maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        A comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --uri
        Print a list of resource URIs instead of the default output.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    The following command gets the IAM policy for the authority my_authority:

        $ gcloud alpha container binauthz authorities get-iam-policy \
            my_authority
