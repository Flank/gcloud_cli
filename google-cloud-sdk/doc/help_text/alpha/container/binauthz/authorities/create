DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Create an Attestation Authority.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Authority resource - The authority to be created. This represents a Cloud
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways. To set the [project] attribute: provide the flag
     [AUTHORITY] on the command line with a fully specified name; provide the
     flag [--project] on the command line; set the property [core/project].
     This must be specified.

       AUTHORITY
          The ID of the authority or a fully qualified identifier for the
          authority.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Note resource - The Container Analysis ATTESTATION_AUTHORITY Note to which
     the created attestation authority will be bound.

    For the attestation authority to be able to access and use the Note, the
    Note must exist and the active gcloud account (core/account) must have the
    containeranalysis.occurrences.viewer permission for the Note. This can be
    achieved by granting the containeranalysis.notes.viewer role to the active
    account for the Note resource in question.

        The arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. This must be specified.

         --authority-note=AUTHORITY_NOTE
            The ID of the note or a fully qualified identifier for the note.
            This flag must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
            group are specified.

         --authority-note-project=AUTHORITY_NOTE_PROJECT
            The Container Analysis project for the note.
