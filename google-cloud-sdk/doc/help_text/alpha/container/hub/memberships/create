NAME
    gcloud alpha container hub memberships create - create a new membership for
        a cluster

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha container hub memberships create
        (MEMBERSHIP : --location=LOCATION) [--async]
        [--external-id=EXTERNAL_ID]
        [--gke-cluster-self-link=GKE_CLUSTER_SELF_LINK]
        [--labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Create a Hub membership resource corresponding to the cluster.

    This command does not install the Connect Agent or in-cluster Kubernetes
    Resources that are required to connect the cluster with Google. For
    complete cluster registration, consider using the command: gcloud alpha
    container hub memberships register --help.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Membership resource - The cluster membership to create. The arguments in
     this group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE)
     Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in
     other ways. To set the [project] attribute: provide the argument
     [membership] on the command line with a fully specified name; set the
     property [core/project]; provide the argument [--project] on the command
     line. This must be specified.

       MEMBERSHIP
          ID of the membership or fully qualified identifier for the
          membership. This positional must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location name.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --external-id=EXTERNAL_ID
        External-id of the membership resource.

     --gke-cluster-self-link=GKE_CLUSTER_SELF_LINK
        GKE cluster self-link of the cluster represented by this membership;
        for example,
        '//container.googleapis.com/projects/my-project/locations/us-central1-a/clusters/my-cluster.'
        This is only valid if the represented cluster is a GKE cluster. The
        provided self-link will be validated to confirm that it maps to the
        cluster represented by this membership.

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the gkehub/v1alpha2 API. The full documentation for this
    API can be found at:
    https://cloud.google.com/anthos/multicluster-management/connect/registering-a-cluster

EXAMPLES
    Create a new membership for a cluster in Hub:

        $ gcloud alpha container hub memberships create a-membership

    Create a new membership for a GKE cluster:

        $ gcloud alpha container hub memberships create a-membership \
            --gke-cluster-self-link=my-gke-cluster-self-link

NOTES
    This command is an internal implementation detail and may change or
    disappear without notice. This command is currently in ALPHA and may change
    without notice. If this command fails with API permission errors despite
    specifying the right project, you may be trying to access an API with an
    invitation-only early access allowlist.
