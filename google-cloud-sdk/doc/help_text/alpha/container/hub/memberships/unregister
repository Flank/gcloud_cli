NAME
    gcloud alpha container hub memberships unregister - unregister a cluster
        from Hub

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha container hub memberships unregister CLUSTER_NAME
        (--gke-cluster=LOCATION/CLUSTER_NAME | --gke-uri=GKE_URI
          | [--context=CONTEXT : --kubeconfig=KUBECONFIG])
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) This command unregisters a cluster with the Hub by:

        1. Deleting the Hub Membership resource for this cluster (a.k.a
           `gcloud alpha container hub memberships delete`).
        2. Removing the corresponding in-cluster Kubernetes Resources that make the
           cluster exclusive to one Hub (a.k.a `kubectl delete memberships
           membership`).
        3. Uninstalling the Connect Agent from this cluster (a.k.a
           `kubectl delete on the gke-connect namespace`).

    The unregister command makes additional internal checks to ensure that all
    three steps can be safely done to properly clean-up in-Hub and in-cluster
    resources.

    To register a non-GKE cluster use --context flag (with an optional
    --kubeconfig flag).

    To register a GKE cluster use --gke-cluster or --gke-uri flag (no
    --kubeconfig flag is required).

    To only delete the Hub membership resource, consider using the command:
    gcloud alpha container hub memberships delete. This command is intended to
    delete stale Hub Membership resources as doing so on a fully registered
    cluster will skip some of the steps above and orphan in-cluster resources
    and agent connections to Google.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     CLUSTER_NAME
        The membership name that corresponds to the cluster being unregistered.
        To get list of all the memberships on the Hub, consider using the
        command: gcloud alpha container hub memberships list.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Cluster identifier. Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --gke-cluster=LOCATION/CLUSTER_NAME
          The location/name of the GKE cluster. The location can be a zone or a
          region for e.g us-central1-a/my-cluster.

       --gke-uri=GKE_URI
          The URI of the GKE cluster; for example,
          'https://container.googleapis.com/projects/my-project/locations/us-central1-a/clusters/my-cluster'
          The URI can obtain by calling: gcloud container clusters list --uri
          This is only valid if the represented cluster is a GKE cluster. The
          provided URI will be validated to confirm that it maps to the valid
          GKE cluster.

       Non-GKE cluster identifier.

         --context=CONTEXT
            The cluster context as it appears in the kubeconfig file. You can
            get this value from the command line by running command: kubectl
            config current-context. This flag must be specified if any of the
            other arguments in this group are specified.

         --kubeconfig=KUBECONFIG
            The kubeconfig file containing an entry for the cluster. Defaults
            to $KUBECONFIG if it is set in the environment, otherwise defaults
            to $HOME/.kube/config.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    Unregister a non-GKE cluster referenced from a specific kubeconfig file:

        $ gcloud alpha container hub memberships unregister my-cluster \
          --context=my-cluster-context \
          --kubeconfig=/home/user/custom_kubeconfig

    Unregister a non-GKE cluster referenced from the default kubeconfig file:

        $ gcloud alpha container hub memberships unregister my-cluster \
            --context=my-cluster-context

    Unregister a GKE cluster referenced from a GKE URI:

        $ gcloud alpha container hub memberships unregister my-cluster \
          --gke-uri=my-cluster-gke-uri

    Unregister a GKE cluster referenced from a GKE Cluster location and name:

        $ gcloud alpha container hub memberships unregister my-cluster \
          --gke-cluster=my-cluster-region-or-zone/my-cluster

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud container hub memberships unregister
        $ gcloud beta container hub memberships unregister
