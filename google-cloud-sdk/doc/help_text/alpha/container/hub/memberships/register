NAME
    gcloud alpha container hub memberships register - register a cluster with
        Hub

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha container hub memberships register CLUSTER_NAME
        (--gke-cluster=LOCATION/CLUSTER_NAME | --gke-uri=GKE_URI
          | [--context=CONTEXT : --kubeconfig=KUBECONFIG])
        (--service-account-key-file=SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_FILE
          | [--enable-workload-identity
          : --public-issuer-url=PUBLIC_ISSUER_URL])
        [--manifest-output-file=MANIFEST_OUTPUT_FILE] [--proxy=PROXY]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) This command registers a cluster with the Hub by:

        1. Creating a Hub Membership resource corresponding to the cluster.
        2. Adding in-cluster Kubernetes Resources that make the cluster exclusive
           to one Hub.
        3. Installing the Connect Agent into this cluster.

    A successful registration implies that the cluster is now exclusive to a
    single Hub.

    For more information about Connect Agent, go to:
    https://cloud.google.com/anthos/multicluster-management/connect/overview/

    To register a non-GKE or GKE On-Prem cluster use --context flag (with an
    optional --kubeconfig flag).

    To register a GKE cluster use --gke-cluster or --gke-uri flag (no
    --kubeconfig flag is required).

    In all cases, the Connect Agent that is installed in the target cluster
    must authenticate to Google using a --service-account-key-file that
    corresponds to a service account that has been granted gkehub.connect
    permissions.

    If the cluster is already registered to another Hub, the registration is
    not successful.

    Rerunning this command against the same cluster with the same CLUSTER_NAME
    and target GKEHub is successful and upgrades the Connect Agent if a new
    agent is available.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     CLUSTER_NAME
        The membership name that you choose to uniquely represents the cluster
        being registered on the Hub.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Cluster identifier. Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --gke-cluster=LOCATION/CLUSTER_NAME
          The location/name of the GKE cluster. The location can be a zone or a
          region for e.g us-central1-a/my-cluster.

       --gke-uri=GKE_URI
          The URI of the GKE cluster; for example,
          'https://container.googleapis.com/projects/my-project/locations/us-central1-a/clusters/my-cluster'
          The URI can obtain by calling: gcloud container clusters list --uri
          This is only valid if the represented cluster is a GKE cluster. The
          provided URI will be validated to confirm that it maps to the valid
          GKE cluster.

       Non-GKE cluster identifier.

         --context=CONTEXT
            The cluster context as it appears in the kubeconfig file. You can
            get this value from the command line by running command: kubectl
            config current-context. This flag must be specified if any of the
            other arguments in this group are specified.

         --kubeconfig=KUBECONFIG
            The kubeconfig file containing an entry for the cluster. Defaults
            to $KUBECONFIG if it is set in the environment, otherwise defaults
            to $HOME/.kube/config.

     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --service-account-key-file=SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_FILE
          The JSON file of a Google Cloud service account private key. This
          service account key is stored as a secret named creds-gcp in
          gke-connect namespace. To update the creds-gcp secret in gke-connect
          namespace with a new service account key file, run the following
          command:

          kubectl delete secret creds-gcp -n gke-connect

          kubectl create secret generic creds-gcp -n gke-connect
          --from-file=creds-gcp.json=/path/to/file

       Workload Identity

         --enable-workload-identity
            Enable Workload Identity when registering the cluster with Hub.
            Requires gcloud alpha. --service_account_key_file flag should not
            be set if this is set. This flag must be specified if any of the
            other arguments in this group are specified.

         --public-issuer-url=PUBLIC_ISSUER_URL
            Skip auto-discovery and register the cluster with this issuer URL.
            Use this option when the OpenID Provider Configuration and
            associated JSON Web Key Set for validating the cluster's service
            account JWTs are served at a public endpoint different from the
            cluster API server. Requires gcloud alpha and
            --enable-workload-identity.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --manifest-output-file=MANIFEST_OUTPUT_FILE
        The full path of the file into which the Connect Agent installation
        manifest should be stored. If this option is provided, then the
        manifest will be written to this file and will not be deployed into the
        cluster by gcloud, and it will need to be deployed manually.

     --proxy=PROXY
        The proxy address in the format of http[s]://{hostname}. The proxy must
        support the HTTP CONNECT method in order for this connection to
        succeed.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right

    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud container hub memberships register
        $ gcloud beta container hub memberships register
