NAME
    gcloud alpha container hub - centrally manage features and services on all
        your Kubernetes clusters with Hub

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha container hub GROUP [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) The command group to register GKE or other Kubernetes clusters
    running in a variety of environments, including Google cloud, on premises
    in customer datacenters, or other third party clouds with Hub. Hub provides
    a centralized control-plane to managed features and services on all
    registered clusters.

    A registered cluster is always associated with a Membership, a resource
    within Hub.

    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
