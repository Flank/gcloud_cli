NAME
    gcloud alpha container hub register-cluster - registers a cluster with
        Google Cloud Platform

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha container hub register-cluster CLUSTER_NAME --context=CONTEXT
        --service-account-key-file=SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_FILE
        [--kubeconfig-file=KUBECONFIG_FILE]
        [--manifest-output-file=MANIFEST_OUTPUT_FILE] [--proxy=PROXY]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) This command registers a cluster referenced from a kubeconfig file
    with Google Cloud Platform. It also installs the Connect agent into this
    cluster, or updates the Connect agent in a previously-registered cluster.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     CLUSTER_NAME
        The name of the cluster being registered.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --context=CONTEXT
        The context in the kubeconfig file that specifies the cluster.

     --service-account-key-file=SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_FILE
        The JSON file of a Google Cloud service account private key.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --kubeconfig-file=KUBECONFIG_FILE
        The kubeconfig file containing an entry for the cluster. Defaults to
        $KUBECONFIG if it is set in the environment, otherwise defaults to to
        $HOME/.kube/config.

     --manifest-output-file=MANIFEST_OUTPUT_FILE
        The full path of the file into which the Connect agent installation
        manifest should be stored. If this option is provided, then the
        manifest will be written to this file and will not be deployed into the
        cluster by gcloud, and it will need to be deployed manually.

     --proxy=PROXY
        The proxy address in the format of http[s]://{hostname}. The proxy must
        support the HTTP CONNECT method in order for this connection to
        succeed.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

EXAMPLES
    Register a cluster referenced from the default kubeconfig file, installing
    the Connect agent:

        $ gcloud alpha container hub register-cluster my-cluster \
            --context=my-cluster-context \
            --service-account-key-file=/tmp/keyfile.json

    Upgrade the Connect agent in a cluster:

        $ gcloud alpha container hub register-cluster my-cluster \
            --context=my-cluster-context \
            --service-account-key-file=/tmp/keyfile.json

    Register a cluster and output a manifest that can be used to install the
    Connect agent:

        $ gcloud alpha container hub register-cluster my-cluster \
            --context=my-cluster-context \
            --manifest-output-file=/tmp/manifest.yaml \
            --service-account-key-file=/tmp/keyfile.json
