DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Update an existing access zone.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     ZONE - The access zone to update. The arguments in this group can be used
     to specify the attributes of this resource. This must be specified.

       ZONE
          The ID of the zone or a fully qualified identifier for the zone. This
          positional must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
          group are specified.

       --policy=POLICY
          The ID of the access policy.

FLAGS
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Long-form description of access zone.

     --title=TITLE
        Short human-readable title of the access zone.

     --type=TYPE
        Type of the zone.

        A regular zone allows resources within this access zone to import and
        export data amongst themselves. A project may belong to at most one
        regular access zone.

        A bridge access zone llows resources in different regular access zones
        to import and export data between each other. A project may belong to
        multiple bridge access zones (only if it also belongs to a regular
        access zone). Both restricted and unrestricted service lists, as well
        as access level lists, must be empty.

        TYPE must be one of: bridge, regular.

     These flags modify the member access levels of this zone. An intra-zone
     request must satisfy these access levels (for example, MY_LEVEL; must be
     in the same access policy as this zone) to be allowed. At most one of
     these may be specified:

       --add-access-levels=[LEVEL,...]
          Append the given values to the current access levels.

       --clear-access-levels
          Empty the current access levels.

       --remove-access-levels=[LEVEL,...]
          Remove the given values from the current access levels.

       --set-access-levels=[LEVEL,...]
          Completely replace the current access levels with the given values.

     These flags modify the member resources of this zone. Resources must be
     projects, in the form project/<projectnumber>. At most one of these may be
     specified:

       --add-resources=[RESOURCES,...]
          Append the given values to the current resources.

       --clear-resources
          Empty the current resources.

       --remove-resources=[RESOURCES,...]
          Remove the given values from the current resources.

       --set-resources=[RESOURCES,...]
          Completely replace the current resources with the given values.

     These flags modify the member restricted services of this zone. The zone
     boundary DOES apply to these services (for example,
     storage.googleapis.com). A wildcard (*) may be given to denote all
     services. If unrestricted services are set, restricted services must be a
     wildcard. At most one of these may be specified:

       --add-restricted-services=[SERVICE,...]
          Append the given values to the current restricted services.

       --clear-restricted-services
          Empty the current restricted services.

       --remove-restricted-services=[SERVICE,...]
          Remove the given values from the current restricted services.

       --set-restricted-services=[SERVICE,...]
          Completely replace the current restricted services with the given
          values.

     These flags modify the member unrestricted services of this zone. The zone
     boundary DOES NOT apply to these services (for example,
     storage.googleapis.com). A wildcard (*) may be given to denote all
     services. If restricted services are set, unrestricted services must be a
     wildcard. At most one of these may be specified:

       --add-unrestricted-services=[SERVICE,...]
          Append the given values to the current unrestricted services.

       --clear-unrestricted-services
          Empty the current unrestricted services.

       --remove-unrestricted-services=[SERVICE,...]
          Remove the given values from the current unrestricted services.

       --set-unrestricted-services=[SERVICE,...]
          Completely replace the current unrestricted services with the given
          values.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is an internal implementation detail and may change or
    disappear without notice. This command is currently in ALPHA and may change
    without notice. Usually, users of ALPHA commands and flags need to apply
    for access, agree to applicable terms, and have their projects whitelisted.
