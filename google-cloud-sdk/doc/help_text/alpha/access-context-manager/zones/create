DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Create a new access zone in a given access policy.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     ZONE - The access zone to create. The arguments in this group can be used
     to specify the attributes of this resource. This must be specified.

       ZONE
          The ID of the zone or a fully qualified identifier for the zone. This
          positional must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
          group are specified.

       --policy=POLICY
          The ID of the access policy.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --resources=[RESOURCES,...]
        Comma-separated list of resources (currently only projects, in the form
        project/<projectnumber>) in this zone.

     --title=TITLE
        Short human-readable title for the access zone.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --access-levels=[LEVEL,...]
        Comma-separated list of IDs for access levels (in the same policy) that
        an intra-zone request must satisfy to be allowed.

     --async
        Display information about the operation in progress, without waiting
        for the operation to complete.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Long-form description of access zone.

     --zone-type=ZONE_TYPE; default="regular"
        Type of the zone. ZONE_TYPE must be one of:

         bridge
            Allows resources in different regular access zones to import and
            export data between each other.

            A project may belong to multiple bridge access zones (only if it
            also belongs to a regular access zone). Both restricted and
            unrestricted service lists, as well as access level lists, must be
            empty.

         regular
            Allows resources within this access zone to import and export data
            amongst themselves.

            A project may belong to at most one regular access zone.

     For a regular access zone, these parameters specify the services to which
     the zone boundary applies. Only one may be provided, and the other is
     implicitly provided as a wildcard (*) matching all other services. For
     instance, --restricted-services storage.googleapis.com applies the zone
     boundary to the Google Cloud Storage service, but not any other services.
     At most one of these may be specified:

       --restricted-services=[SERVICE,...]
          Comma-separated list of services to which the zone boundary does
          apply (for example, storage.googleapis.com).

       --unrestricted-services=[SERVICE,...]
          Comma-separated list of services to which the zone boundary does not
          apply (for example, storage.googleapis.com).

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

    disappear without notice. This command is currently in ALPHA and may change
    without notice. Usually, users of ALPHA commands and flags need to apply
    for access, agree to applicable terms, and have their projects whitelisted.
