DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Update an existing access zone.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Level resource - The service perimemter to update. The arguments in this
     group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. This must be
     specified.

       PERIMETER
          The ID of the level or a fully qualified identifier for the level.
          This positional must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --policy=POLICY
          The ID of the access policy.

FLAGS
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Long-form description of service perimeter.

     --title=TITLE
        Short human-readable title of the service perimeter.

     --type=TYPE
        Type of the perimeter.

        A regular perimeter allows resources within this service perimeter to
        import and export data amongst themselves. A project may belong to at
        most one regular service perimeter.

        A bridge perimeter allows resources in different regular service
        perimeters to import and export data between each other. A project may
        belong to multiple bridge service perimeters (only if it also belongs
        to a regular service perimeter). Both restricted and unrestricted
        service lists, as well as access level lists, must be empty.

        TYPE must be one of: bridge, regular.

     These flags modify the member access levels of this perimeter. An
     intra-perimeter request must satisfy these access levels (for example,
     MY_LEVEL; must be in the same access policy as this perimeter) to be
     allowed. At most one of these may be specified:

       --add-access-levels=[LEVEL,...]
          Append the given values to the current access levels.

       --clear-access-levels
          Empty the current access levels.

       --remove-access-levels=[LEVEL,...]
          Remove the given values from the current access levels.

       --set-access-levels=[LEVEL,...]
          Completely replace the current access levels with the given values.

     These flags modify the member resources of this perimeter. Resources must
     be projects, in the form projects/<projectnumber>. At most one of these
     may be specified:

       --add-resources=[RESOURCES,...]
          Append the given values to the current resources.

       --clear-resources
          Empty the current resources.

       --remove-resources=[RESOURCES,...]
          Remove the given values from the current resources.

       --set-resources=[RESOURCES,...]
          Completely replace the current resources with the given values.

     These flags modify the member restricted services of this perimeter. The
     perimeter boundary DOES apply to these services (for example,
     storage.googleapis.com). A wildcard (*) may be given to denote all
     services. If unrestricted services are set, restricted services must be a
     wildcard. At most one of these may be specified:

       --add-restricted-services=[SERVICE,...]
          Append the given values to the current restricted services.

       --clear-restricted-services
          Empty the current restricted services.

       --remove-restricted-services=[SERVICE,...]
          Remove the given values from the current restricted services.

       --set-restricted-services=[SERVICE,...]
          Completely replace the current restricted services with the given
          values.

     These flags modify the member unrestricted services of this perimemter.
     The perimeter boundary DOES NOT apply to these services (for example,
     storage.googleapis.com). A wildcard (*) may be given to denote all
     services. If restricted services are set, unrestricted services must be a
     wildcard. At most one of these may be specified:

       --add-unrestricted-services=[SERVICE,...]
          Append the given values to the current unrestricted services.

       --clear-unrestricted-services
          Empty the current unrestricted services.

       --remove-unrestricted-services=[SERVICE,...]
          Remove the given values from the current unrestricted services.

       --set-unrestricted-services=[SERVICE,...]
          Completely replace the current unrestricted services with the given
          values.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is an internal implementation detail and may change or
    disappear without notice. This command is currently in ALPHA and may change
    without notice. Usually, users of ALPHA commands and flags need to apply
    for access, agree to applicable terms, and have their projects whitelisted.
