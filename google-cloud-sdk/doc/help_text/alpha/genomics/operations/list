NAME
    gcloud alpha genomics operations list - list Genomics operations in a
        project

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha genomics operations list [--filter=FILTER] [--where=WHERE]
        [--limit=LIMIT] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Prints a table with summary information on operations in the
    project.

FLAGS
     --filter=FILTER
        A string for filtering operations created with the v2alpha1 API. In
        addition to typical operators (AND, OR, =, >, etc.) the following
        filter fields are supported:

            metadata.createTime - The time the operation was created as a
                                  timestamp YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS<time zone>.  T can
                                  also be used as a separator between the date and
                                  time.  The time zone is optional and can be
                                  specified as an offset from UTC, a name, or 'Z'
                                  for UTC. Run $ gcloud topic datetimes
                                  to see more examples.

                           done - A boolean for whether the operation has
                                  completed.
                     error.code - A google.rpc.Code for a completed operation.
                metadata.events - A set of strings for all events on the
                                  operation.
                                      events:WorkerStartedEvent
                metadata.labels - A map of string key and value for the operation.
                                      labels.key = value
                                      labels."key with space" = "value with space"
                                  For the existence of a key with any value.
                                      labels.key:*
        Run "$ gcloud topic filters" for more information.

     --where=WHERE
        A string for filtering operations created with the v1alpha2 API. The
        following filter fields are supported:

            createTime - The time this job was created, in seconds from the
                         epoch. Can use '>=' and/or '<=' operators.
            status     - Can be 'RUNNING', 'SUCCESS', 'FAILURE' or 'CANCELED'.
                         Only one status may be specified.
            labels.key - 'key' is a label key to match against a target value.

        Example:

            'createTime >= 1432140000 AND
             createTime <= 1432150000 AND
             labels.batch = test AND
             status = RUNNING'

        To calculate the timestamp as seconds from the epoch, on UNIX-like
        systems (e.g.: Linux, Mac) use the 'date' command:

            $ date --date '20150701' '+%s'

            1435734000

        or with Python (e.g.: Linux, Mac, Windows):

            $ python \
                -c \
                'from time import mktime, strptime; print
             int(mktime(strptime("01 July 2015", "%d %B %Y")))'

            1435734000

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access whitelist.
