NAME
    gcloud alpha genomics operations list - list Genomics operations in a
        project

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha genomics operations list [--where=WHERE] [--limit=LIMIT]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Prints a table with summary information on operations in the
    project.

FLAGS
     --where=WHERE
        A string for filtering operations. The following filter fields are
        supported:

            createTime - The time this job was created, in seconds from the
                         epoch. Can use '>=' and/or '<=' operators.
            status     - Can be 'RUNNING', 'SUCCESS', 'FAILURE' or 'CANCELED'.
                         Only one status may be specified.
            labels.key - 'key' is a label key to match against a target value.

        Example:

            'createTime >= 1432140000 AND
             createTime <= 1432150000 AND
             labels.batch = test AND
             status = RUNNING'

        To calculate the timestamp as seconds from the epoch, on UNIX-like
        systems (e.g.: Linux, Mac) use the 'date' command:

            $ date --date '20150701' '+%s'

            1435734000

        or with Python (e.g.: Linux, Mac, Windows):

            $ python \
                -c \
                'from time import mktime, strptime; print
             int(mktime(strptime("01 July 2015", "%d %B %Y")))'

            1435734000

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --limit=LIMIT
        The maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. Usually,
    users of ALPHA commands and flags need to apply for access, agree to
    applicable terms, and have their projects whitelisted. Contact Google or
    sign up on a product's page for ALPHA access. Product pages can be found at
