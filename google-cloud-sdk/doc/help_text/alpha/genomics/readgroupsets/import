NAME
    gcloud alpha genomics readgroupsets import - imports read group sets into a
        dataset

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha genomics readgroupsets import --dataset-id=DATASET_ID
        --source-uris=[SOURCE_URIS,...]
        [--partition-strategy=PARTITION_STRATEGY]
        [--reference-set-id=REFERENCE_SET_ID] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Imports read group sets from a set of BAM files in Google Cloud
    Storage. See [](https://cloud.google.com/genomics/managing-reads for more
    details)

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --dataset-id=DATASET_ID
        The ID of the dataset the imported read group sets will belong to.

     --source-uris=[SOURCE_URIS,...]
        Comma separated list of Google Cloud Storage URIs for BAM files
        (https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf) to be imported.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --partition-strategy=PARTITION_STRATEGY
        One of "PER_FILE_PER_SAMPLE" or "MERGE_ALL". The partition strategy
        describes how read groups from the provided files are partitioned into
        read group sets. In general, use PER_FILE_PER_SAMPLE when importing
        multiple samples from multiple files and use MERGE_ALL when importing a
        single sample from multiple files. Defaults to PER_FILE_PER_SAMPLE

     --reference-set-id=REFERENCE_SET_ID
        The reference set ID to associate with the imported read group sets.
        The reference headers in the provided BAM files will be validated
        against this ID. The reference set ID can be used by consumers of your
        imported read group sets for more robust reference genome comparison.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    Import a single BAM file and associate with the GRCh38 reference set:

        $ gcloud alpha genomics readgroupsets import --dataset-id 123 \
            --reference-set-id "EMud_c37lKPXTQ" \
            --source-uris "gs://mybucket/reads.bam"

    Import a single sample which is sharded across multiple BAM files:

        $ gcloud alpha genomics readgroupsets import --dataset-id 123 \
            --partition-strategy MERGE_ALL \
            --source-uris "gs://mybucket/chr?.bam,gs://mybucket/mt.bam"

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. Usually,
    users of ALPHA commands and flags need to apply for access, agree to
    applicable terms, and have their projects whitelisted. Contact Google or
