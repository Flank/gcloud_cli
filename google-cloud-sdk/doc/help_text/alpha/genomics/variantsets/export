    gcloud alpha genomics variantsets export - exports data from a variant set
        to an external destination

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha genomics variantsets export ID TABLE
        --bigquery-dataset=BIGQUERY_DATASET
        [--bigquery-project=BIGQUERY_PROJECT]
        [--call-set-ids=[CALL_SET_IDS,...]] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Exports data from a variant set to an external destination.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     ID
        The ID of the variant set to export.

     TABLE
        The BigQuery table to which data is exported. If this table does not
        exist, it will be created. If it already exists, it will be
        overwritten.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --bigquery-dataset=BIGQUERY_DATASET
        The BigQuery dataset to which data is exported. This dataset must
        already exist. Note that this is distinct from the Genomics concept of
        "dataset."

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --bigquery-project=BIGQUERY_PROJECT
        The Google Cloud project ID that owns the destination BigQuery dataset.
        The caller must have WRITE access to this project. This project will
        also own the resulting export job.If not supplied, defaults to the
        gcloud project ID.

     --call-set-ids=[CALL_SET_IDS,...]
        If provided, only variant call information from the specified call sets
        will be exported. By default all variant call sets are exported.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. Usually,
    users of ALPHA commands and flags need to apply for access, agree to
    applicable terms, and have their projects whitelisted. Contact Google or
    sign up on a product's page for ALPHA access. Product pages can be found at
