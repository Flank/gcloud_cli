NAME
    gcloud alpha genomics reads list - lists reads within a given read group
        set

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha genomics reads list READ_GROUP_SET_ID [--end=END]
        [--reference-name=REFERENCE_NAME] [--start=START] [--filter=EXPRESSION]
        [--limit=LIMIT] [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE; default=512]
        [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]] [--uri] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Prints a table with summary information on reads in the read group
    set. Results may be restricted to reads which are aligned to a given
    reference (--reference-name) or may be further filtered to reads that have
    alignments overlapping a given range (--reference-name, --start, --end).

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     READ_GROUP_SET_ID
        Restrict the list to reads in this read group set.

FLAGS
     --end=END
        The end of the window (0-based exclusive) for which overlapping reads
        should be returned. If unspecified or 0, defaults to the length of the
        reference.

     --reference-name=REFERENCE_NAME
        Only return reads which are aligned to this reference. Pass * to list
        unmapped reads only.

     --start=START
        The beginning of the window (0-based inclusive) for which overlapping
        reads should be returned. If unspecified, defaults to 0.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        The maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE; default=512
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is 512.
        Paging may be applied before or after --filter and --limit depending on
        the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        A comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --uri
        Print a list of resource URIs instead of the default output.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. Usually,
    users of ALPHA commands and flags need to apply for access, agree to
    applicable terms, and have their projects whitelisted. Contact Google or
    sign up on a product's page for ALPHA access. Product pages can be found at
