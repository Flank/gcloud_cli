NAME
    gcloud alpha genomics variants import - imports variants into Google
        Genomics

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha genomics variants import
        --source-uris=SOURCE_URIS,[SOURCE_URIS,...]
        --variantset-id=VARIANTSET_ID
        [--file-format=FILE_FORMAT; default="vcf"]
        [--info-merge-config=INFO_MERGE_CONFIG,[...]]
        [--normalize-reference-names] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Import variants from VCF or MasterVar files that are in Google
    Cloud Storage.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --source-uris=SOURCE_URIS,[SOURCE_URIS,...]
        A comma-delimited list of URI patterns referencing existing VCF or
        MasterVar files in Google Cloud Storage.

     --variantset-id=VARIANTSET_ID
        The ID of the destination variant set.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --file-format=FILE_FORMAT; default="vcf"
        Set the file format of the --source-uris. FILE_FORMAT must be one of:
        complete-genomics, vcf.

     --info-merge-config=INFO_MERGE_CONFIG,[...]
        A mapping between VCF INFO field keys and the operations to be
        performed on them. Valid operations include: IGNORE_NEW - By default,
        variant info fields are persisted if the variant does not yet exist in
        the variant set. If the variant is equivalent to a variant already in
        the variant set, the incoming variant's info field is ignored in favor
        of that of the already persisted variant. MOVE_TO_CALLS - Removes an
        info field from the incoming variant and persists this info field in
        each of the incoming variant's calls.

     --normalize-reference-names
        Convert reference names to the canonical representation. hg19
        haplotypes (those reference names containing "hap") are not modified in
        any way. All other reference names are modified according to the
        following rules: The reference name is capitalized. The "chr" prefix is
        dropped for all autosomes and sex chromsomes. For example "chr17"
        becomes "17" and "chrX" becomes "X". All mitochondrial chromosomes
        ("chrM", "chrMT", etc) become "MT".

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
