SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha dataproc jobs wait JOB [--region=REGION]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     JOB
        The ID of the job to wait for.

FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        Cloud Dataproc region to use. Each Cloud Dataproc region constitutes an
        independent resource namespace constrained to deploying instances into
        Compute Engine zones inside the region. Overrides the default
        dataproc/region property value for this command invocation.

    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

EXAMPLES
    To see a list of all jobs, run:

        $ gcloud dataproc jobs list

    To display these jobs with their respective IDs and underlying REST calls,
    run:

        $ gcloud dataproc jobs list --format "table(reference.jobId)" \
          --limit 1 --log-http

    To view the output of a job as it runs, run:

        $ gcloud alpha dataproc jobs wait job_id

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access whitelist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud dataproc jobs wait
        $ gcloud beta dataproc jobs wait
