DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Submit a Pig job to a cluster.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --cluster=CLUSTER
        The Dataproc cluster to submit the job to.

     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --execute=QUERY, -e QUERY
          A Pig query to execute as part of the job.

       --file=FILE, -f FILE
          HCFS URI of file containing Pig script to execute as the job.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Does not wait for the job to run.

     --bucket=BUCKET
        The Cloud Storage bucket to stage files in. Defaults to the cluster's
        configured bucket.

     --continue-on-failure
        Whether to continue if a single query fails.

     --driver-log-levels=[PACKAGE=LEVEL,...]
        A list of package to log4j log level pairs to configure driver logging.
        For example: root=FATAL,com.example=INFO

     --jars=[JAR,...]
        Comma separated list of jar files to be provided to Pig and MR. May
        contain UDFs.

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     --max-failures-per-hour=MAX_FAILURES_PER_HOUR
        Specifies maximum number of times a job can be restarted in event of
        failure. Expressed as a per-hour rate. Default is 0 (no failure
        retries).

     --params=[PARAM=VALUE,...]
        A list of key value pairs to set variables in the Pig queries.

     --properties=[PROPERTY=VALUE,...]
        A list of key value pairs to configure Pig.

     --region=REGION
        Cloud Dataproc region to use. Each Cloud Dataproc region constitutes an
        independent resource namespace constrained to deploying instances into
        Compute Engine zones inside the region. The default value of global is
        a special multi-region namespace which is capable of deploying
        instances into all Compute Engine zones globally, and is disjoint from
        other Cloud Dataproc regions. Overrides the default dataproc/region
        property value for this command invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

EXAMPLES
    To submit a Pig job with a local script, run:

        $ gcloud alpha dataproc jobs submit pig --cluster my_cluster \
            --file my_queries.pig

    To submit a Pig job with inline queries, run:

        $ gcloud alpha dataproc jobs submit pig --cluster my_cluster \
            -e "LNS = LOAD 'gs://my_bucket/my_file.txt' AS (line)" \
            -e \
            "WORDS = FOREACH LNS GENERATE FLATTEN(TOKENIZE(line)) AS word" \
            -e "GROUPS = GROUP WORDS BY word" \
            -e "WORD_COUNTS = FOREACH GROUPS GENERATE group, COUNT(WORDS)" \
            -e "DUMP WORD_COUNTS"
