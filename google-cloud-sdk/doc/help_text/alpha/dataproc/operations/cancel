SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha dataproc operations cancel (OPERATION : --region=REGION)
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Cancel an active operation.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Operation resource - The ID of the operation to cancel. The arguments in
     this group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE)
     Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in
     other ways. To set the [project] attribute: provide the argument
     [operation] on the command line with a fully specified name; provide the
     argument [--project] on the command line; set the property [core/project].
     This must be specified.

       OPERATION
          ID of the operation or fully qualified identifier for the operation.
          This positional must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --region=REGION
          Dataproc region for the operation. Each Dataproc region constitutes
          an independent resource namespace constrained to deploying instances
          into Compute Engine zones inside the region. Overrides the default
          dataproc/region property value for this command invocation.

    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access whitelist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud dataproc operations cancel
