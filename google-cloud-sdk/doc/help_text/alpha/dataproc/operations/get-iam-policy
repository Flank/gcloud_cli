NAME
    gcloud alpha dataproc operations get-iam-policy - get IAM policy for an
        operation

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha dataproc operations get-iam-policy OPERATION [--region=REGION]
        [--filter=EXPRESSION] [--limit=LIMIT] [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE]
        [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Gets the IAM policy for an operation, given an operation ID.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     OPERATION
        The ID of the operation to retrieve the policy for.

FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        Cloud Dataproc region to use. Each Cloud Dataproc region constitutes an
        independent resource namespace constrained to deploying instances into
        Compute Engine zones inside the region. The default value of global is
        a special multi-region namespace which is capable of deploying
        instances into all Compute Engine zones globally, and is disjoint from
        other Cloud Dataproc regions. Overrides the default dataproc/region
        property value for this command invocation.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

EXAMPLES
    The following command prints the IAM policy for an operation with the ID
    example-operation:

        $ gcloud alpha dataproc operations get-iam-policy example-operation

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
    https://cloud.google.com/support/. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud dataproc operations get-iam-policy
        $ gcloud beta dataproc operations get-iam-policy
