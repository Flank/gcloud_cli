NAME
    gcloud alpha dataproc clusters export - export a cluster

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha dataproc clusters export NAME [--destination=DESTINATION]
        [--region=REGION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Exports an existing cluster's configuration to a file. This
    configuration can then be used to create new clusters using the import
    command.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        The name of the cluster to export.

FLAGS
     --destination=DESTINATION
        Path to a YAML file where the cluster configuration will be exported.
        The exported data will not contain any output-only fields.
        Alternatively, you may omit this flag to write to standard output. A
        schema describing the export/import format can be found in:
        $CLOUDSDKROOT/lib/googlecloudsdk/schemas/dataproc/v1/Cluster.yaml.

     --region=REGION
        Cloud Dataproc region to use. Each Cloud Dataproc region constitutes an
        independent resource namespace constrained to deploying instances into
        Compute Engine zones inside the region. The default value of global is
        a special multi-region namespace which is capable of deploying
        instances into all Compute Engine zones globally, and is disjoint from
        other Cloud Dataproc regions. Overrides the default dataproc/region
        property value for this command invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
    https://cloud.google.com/support/. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta dataproc clusters export
