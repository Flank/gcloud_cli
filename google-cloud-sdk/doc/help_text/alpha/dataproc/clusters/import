NAME
    gcloud alpha dataproc clusters import - import a cluster

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha dataproc clusters import NAME [--async] [--region=REGION]
        [--source=SOURCE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) This will create a new cluster with the given configuration. If a
    cluster with this name already exists, an error will be thrown.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        The name of the cluster to import.

FLAGS
     --async
        Display information about the operation in progress, without waiting
        for the operation to complete.

     --region=REGION
        Cloud Dataproc region to use. Each Cloud Dataproc region constitutes an
        independent resource namespace constrained to deploying instances into
        Compute Engine zones inside the region. The default value of global is
        a special multi-region namespace which is capable of deploying
        instances into all Compute Engine zones globally, and is disjoint from
        other Cloud Dataproc regions. Overrides the default dataproc/region
        property value for this command invocation.

     --source=SOURCE
        Path to a YAML file containing cluster configuration export data. The
        YAML file must not contain any output-only fields. Alternatively, you
        may omit this flag to read from standard input. A schema describing the
        export/import format can be found in:
        $CLOUDSDKROOT/lib/googlecloudsdk/schemas/dataproc/v1/Cluster.yaml.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
    https://cloud.google.com/support/. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta dataproc clusters import
