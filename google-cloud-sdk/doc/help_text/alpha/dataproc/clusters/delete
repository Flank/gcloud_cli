NAME
    gcloud alpha dataproc clusters delete - delete a cluster

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha dataproc clusters delete NAME [--async] [--region=REGION]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Delete a cluster.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        The name of the cluster to delete.

FLAGS
     --async
        Display information about the operation in progress, without waiting
        for the operation to complete.

     --region=REGION
        Cloud Dataproc region to use. Each Cloud Dataproc region constitutes an
        independent resource namespace constrained to deploying instances into
        Compute Engine zones inside the region. The default value of global is
        a special multi-region namespace which is capable of deploying
        instances into all Compute Engine zones globally, and is disjoint from
        other Cloud Dataproc regions. Overrides the default dataproc/region
        property value for this command invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

EXAMPLES
    To delete a cluster, run:

        $ gcloud alpha dataproc clusters delete my_cluster
