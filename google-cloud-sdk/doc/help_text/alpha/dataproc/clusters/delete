NAME
    gcloud alpha dataproc clusters delete - delete a cluster

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha dataproc clusters delete (CLUSTER : --region=REGION) [--async]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Delete a cluster.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Cluster resource - The name of the cluster to delete. The arguments in
     this group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE)
     Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in
     other ways. To set the [project] attribute: provide the argument [cluster]
     on the command line with a fully specified name; provide the argument
     [--project] on the command line; set the property [core/project]. This
     must be specified.

       CLUSTER
          ID of the cluster or fully qualified identifier for the cluster. This
          positional must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
          group are specified.

       --region=REGION
          Dataproc region for the cluster. Each Dataproc region constitutes an
          independent resource namespace constrained to deploying instances
          into Compute Engine zones inside the region. Overrides the default
          dataproc/region property value for this command invocation.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To delete a cluster, run:

        $ gcloud alpha dataproc clusters delete my_cluster \
            --region=us-central1

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud dataproc clusters delete
        $ gcloud beta dataproc clusters delete
