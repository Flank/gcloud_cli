NAME
    gcloud alpha dataproc clusters set-iam-policy - set IAM policy for a
        cluster

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha dataproc clusters set-iam-policy CLUSTER POLICY_FILE
        [--region=REGION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Sets the IAM policy for a cluster, given a cluster name and the
    policy.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     CLUSTER
        The ID of the cluster to set the policy on.

     POLICY_FILE
        Path to a local JSON or YAML formatted file containing a valid policy.

FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        Cloud Dataproc region to use. Each Cloud Dataproc region constitutes an
        independent resource namespace constrained to deploying instances into
        Compute Engine zones inside the region. The default value of global is
        a special multi-region namespace which is capable of deploying
        instances into all Compute Engine zones globally, and is disjoint from
        other Cloud Dataproc regions. Overrides the default dataproc/region
        property value for this command invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

EXAMPLES
    The following command sets the IAM policy for a cluster with the name
    example-cluster-name-1 using policy.yaml:

        $ gcloud alpha dataproc clusters set-iam-policy \
            example-cluster-name-1 policy.yaml

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
    https://cloud.google.com/support/. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud dataproc clusters set-iam-policy
        $ gcloud beta dataproc clusters set-iam-policy
