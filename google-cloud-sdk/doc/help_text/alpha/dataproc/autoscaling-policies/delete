NAME
    gcloud alpha dataproc autoscaling-policies delete - delete an autoscaling
        policy

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha dataproc autoscaling-policies delete
        (AUTOSCALING_POLICY : --region=REGION) [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Delete an autoscaling policy.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Autoscaling policy resource - The autoscaling policy to delete. The
     arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways. To set the [project] attribute: provide the
     argument [autoscaling_policy] on the command line with a fully specified
     name; provide the argument [--project] on the command line; set the
     property [core/project]. This must be specified.

       AUTOSCALING_POLICY
          ID of the autoscaling policy or fully qualified identifier for the
          autoscaling policy. This positional must be specified if any of the
          other arguments in this group are specified.

       --region=REGION
          Cloud Dataproc region for the autoscaling policy. Each Cloud Dataproc
          region constitutes an independent resource namespace constrained to
          deploying instances into Google Compute Engine zones inside the
          region. The default value of global is a special multi-region
          namespace which is capable of deploying instances into all Google
          Compute Engine zones globally, and is disjoint from other Cloud
          Dataproc regions. Overrides the default dataproc/region property
          value for this command invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
