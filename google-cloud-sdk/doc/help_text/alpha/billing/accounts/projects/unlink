        linked with a project

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha billing accounts projects unlink PROJECT_ID
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) (DEPRECATED) The gcloud <alpha|beta> billing accounts projects
    groups have been moved to gcloud beta billing projects. Please use the new,
    shorter commands instead.

    This command unlinks a project from its linked billing account. This
    disables billing on the project.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     PROJECT_ID
        Specify a project id.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To unlink the project my-project from its linked billing account, run:

        $ gcloud alpha billing accounts projects unlink my-project

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access whitelist.
