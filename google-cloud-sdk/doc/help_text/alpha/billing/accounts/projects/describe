NAME
    gcloud alpha billing accounts projects describe - show detailed billing
        information for a project

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha billing accounts projects describe PROJECT_ID
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) (DEPRECATED) The gcloud <alpha|beta> billing accounts projects
    groups have been moved to gcloud beta billing projects. Please use the new,
    shorter commands instead.

    This command shows billing info for a project, given its ID.

    This call can fail for the following reasons:

      o The project specified does not exist.
      o The active user does not have permission to access the given project.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     PROJECT_ID
        Specify a project id.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To see detailed billing information for a project my-project, run:

        $ gcloud alpha billing accounts projects describe my-project

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
    https://cloud.google.com/support/.
