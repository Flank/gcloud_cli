NAME
    gcloud alpha billing projects describe - show detailed billing information
        for a project

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha billing projects describe PROJECT_ID [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) This command shows billing info for a project, given its ID.

    This call can fail for the following reasons:

      o The project specified does not exist.
      o The active user does not have permission to access the given project.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     PROJECT_ID
        Specify a project id.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

EXAMPLES
    To see detailed billing information for a project my-project, run:

        $ gcloud alpha billing projects describe my-project

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access whitelist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta billing projects describe
