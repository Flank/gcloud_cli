DESCRIPTION

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Billing account resource - Billing account under which to create the

        characters.

     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --budget-amount=BUDGET_AMOUNT
          Specify the amount of the budget. If a currency type is included, it
          must be the currency associated with the billing account. If
          excluded, the currency used will be the currency associated with the
          billing account.

       --last-period-amount
          Use the amount of last period's budget.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --all-updates-rule-pubsub-topic=ALL_UPDATES_RULE_PUBSUB_TOPIC
        The name of the Cloud Pub/Sub topic where budget related messages will
        be published, in the form projects/{project_id}/topics/{topic_id}.

     --credit-types-treatment=CREDIT_TYPES_TREATMENT
        Whether to include all credit types include when calculating the actual
        spend against the budget. If this is not specified, then all credit
        types are used in the calculation. CREDIT_TYPES_TREATMENT must be one
        of: credit-types-treatment-unspecified, exclude-all-credits,
        include-all-credits.

     --filter-projects=[FILTER_PROJECTS,...]

        usage from only this set of projects should be included in the budget.
        If omitted, all projects will be included.

     --filter-services=[FILTER_SERVICES,...]
        A set of services of the form services/{service_id}, specifying that

     --threshold-rule=THRESHOLD_RULE
        Rule that triggers alerts (notifications of thresholds being crossed)
        when spend exceeds the specified percentages of the budget. This flag
        can be repeated to provide multiple thresholds above which an alert is
        sent.

         percent
            Integer between 0 and 100 above which an alert is sent.

         basis
