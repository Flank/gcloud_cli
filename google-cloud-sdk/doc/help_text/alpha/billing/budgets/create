DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Create a budget.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Billing account resource - Billing account under which to create the
     budget. This represents a Cloud resource. This must be specified.

       --billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT
          ID of the billing-account or fully qualified identifier for the
          billing-account.

     --display-name=DISPLAY_NAME
        User data for display name in UI. Must be less than or equal to 60
        characters.

     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --budget-amount=BUDGET_AMOUNT
          Specify the amount of the budget. If a currency type is included, it
          must be the currency associated with the billing account. If
          excluded, the currency used will be the currency associated with the
          billing account.

       --last-period-amount
          Use the amount of last period's budget.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --all-updates-rule-monitoring-notification-channels=[ALL_UPDATES_RULE_MONITORING_NOTIFICATION_CHANNELS,...]
        Targets to send notifications to when a threshold is exceeded. This is
        in addition to default recipients who have billing account IAM roles.
        The value is the full REST resource name of a monitoring notification
        channel in the form
        projects/{project_id}/notificationChannels/{channel_id}. A maximum of 5
        channels is allowed. See
        https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets-notification-recipients
        for more details.

     --all-updates-rule-pubsub-topic=ALL_UPDATES_RULE_PUBSUB_TOPIC
        Name of the Cloud Pub/Sub topic where budget related messages will be
        published, in the form projects/{project_id}/topics/{topic_id}.

     --credit-types-treatment=CREDIT_TYPES_TREATMENT
        Whether to include all credit types include when calculating the actual
        spend against the budget. If this is not specified, then all credit
        types are used in the calculation. CREDIT_TYPES_TREATMENT must be one
        of: credit-types-treatment-unspecified, exclude-all-credits,
        include-all-credits.

     --disable-default-iam-recipients
        When set to true, disables default notifications sent when a threshold
        is exceeded. Default notifications are sent to those with Billing
        Account Administrator and Billing Account User IAM roles for the target
        account.

     --filter-labels=FILTER_LABELS
        Single label and value pair specifying that usage from only this set of
        labeled resources should be included in the budget. Currently, multiple
        entries or multiple values per entry are not allowed. If omitted, the
        report will include all labeled and unlabeled usage.

     --filter-projects=[FILTER_PROJECTS,...]
        Set of projects in the form projects/{project_id}, specifying that
        usage from only this set of projects should be included in the budget.
        If omitted, all projects will be included.

     --filter-services=[FILTER_SERVICES,...]
        Set of services of the form services/{service_id}, specifying that
        usage from only this set of services should be included in the budget.
        If omitted, the report will include usage for all services. The service
        names are available through the Catalog API:
        https://cloud.google.com/billing/v1/how-tos/catalog-api.

     --filter-subaccounts=[FILTER_SUBACCOUNTS,...]
        Set of subaccounts of the form billingAccounts/{account_id}, specifying
        that usage from only this set of subaccounts should be included in the
        budget. If a subaccount is set to the name of the parent account, usage
        from the parent account will be included. If omitted, the report will
        include usage from the parent account and all subaccounts, if they
        exist.

     --threshold-rule=THRESHOLD_RULE
        Rule that triggers alerts (notifications of thresholds being crossed)
        when spend exceeds the specified percentages of the budget. This flag
        can be repeated to provide multiple thresholds above which an alert is
        sent.

         percent
            Integer between 0 and 100 above which an alert is sent.

         basis
            Type of basis used to determine if spend has passed the threshold.
            Must be one of: 'current-spend' or 'forecasted-spend'. Behavior
            defaults to 'current-spend' if not set.

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the billingbudgets/v1beta1 API. The full documentation
    for this API can be found at:
    https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budget-api-overview

EXAMPLES

    in the default currency ('USD'), to receive notifications when 50% of the
    current budget or 75% of the forecasted budget is spent in the account
    '123', run:

        $ gcloud alpha billing budgets create --billing-account=123 \
            --display-name="BUDGET1" --budget-amount=100.75USD \
            --threshold-rule=percent=50 \
            --threshold-rule=percent=75,basis=forecasted-spend

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
