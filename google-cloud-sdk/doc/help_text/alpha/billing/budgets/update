FLAGS
     --all-updates-rule-monitoring-notification-channels=[ALL_UPDATES_RULE_MONITORING_NOTIFICATION_CHANNELS,...]
        Targets to send notifications to when a threshold is exceeded. This is

        value is the full REST resource name of a monitoring notification
        channel in the form
        projects/{project_id}/notificationChannels/{channel_id}. A maximum of 5

        for more details.

        Name of the Cloud Pub/Sub topic where budget related messages will be
        published, in the form projects/{project_id}/topics/{topic_id}.

     --credit-types-treatment=CREDIT_TYPES_TREATMENT
        Whether to include all the credit types when calculating the actual
        spend against the budget. If this is not specified, then no credit
        types are used in the calculation. CREDIT_TYPES_TREATMENT must be one
        of: credit-types-treatment-unspecified, exclude-all-credits,
        include-all-credits.

     --disable-default-iam-recipients
        When set to true, disables default notifications sent when a threshold
        is exceeded. Default notifications are sent to those with Billing
        Account Administrator and Billing Account User IAM roles for the target
        account.

     --display-name=DISPLAY_NAME
        User data for display name in UI. Must be less than or equal to 60
        characters.

     --filter-labels=FILTER_LABELS
        Single label and value pair specifying that usage from only this set of
        labeled resources should be included in the budget. Currently, multiple
        entries or multiple values per entry are not allowed. If omitted, the
        report will include all labeled and unlabeled usage.

     --filter-projects=[FILTER_PROJECTS,...]
        Set of projects in the form projects/{project_id}, specifying that
        usage from only this set of projects should be included in the budget.
        If omitted, all projects will be included.

     --filter-services=[FILTER_SERVICES,...]
        Set of services of the form services/{service_id}, specifying that
        usage from only this set of services should be included in the budget.
        If omitted, the report will include usage for all services. The service
        names are available through the Catalog API:

     --filter-subaccounts=[FILTER_SUBACCOUNTS,...]
        Set of subaccounts of the form billingAccounts/{account_id}, specifying
        that usage from only this set of subaccounts should be included in the
        budget. If a subaccount is set to the name of the parent account, usage
        from the parent account will be included. If omitted, the report will
        include usage from the parent account and all subaccounts, if they
        exist.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --budget-amount=BUDGET_AMOUNT

          must be the currency associated with the billing account.

          in the file will replace the rules in the budget. This can be used to
          add or remove specific threshold rules.

       --add-threshold-rule=ADD_THRESHOLD_RULE
          Rule that triggers alerts (notifications of thresholds being crossed)
          when spend exceeds the specified percentages of the budget. This flag
          can be repeated to provide multiple thresholds above which an alert
          is sent.

       percent
          Integer between 0 and 100 above which an alert is sent.

       basis
          Type of basis used to determine if spend has passed the threshold.
          Must be one of: 'current-spend' or 'forecasted-spend'. Behavior
          defaults to 'current-spend' if not set.

       --clear-threshold-rules
          Removes all threshold rules from the budget.

    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
