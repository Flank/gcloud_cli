FLAGS
     --all-updates-rule-monitoring-notification-channels=[ALL_UPDATES_RULE_MONITORING_NOTIFICATION_CHANNELS,...]

        in addition to default recipients who have billing account roles. The
        value is the full REST resource name of a monitoring notification
        channel in the form
        projects/{project_id}/notificationChannels/{channel_id}. A maximum of 5
        channels is allowed. See
        https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets-notification-recipients

        published, in the form projects/{project_id}/topics/{topic_id}.

     --credit-types-treatment=CREDIT_TYPES_TREATMENT
        Whether to include all the credit types when calculating the actual
        spend against the budget. If this is not specified, then no credit
        types are used in the calculation. CREDIT_TYPES_TREATMENT must be one
        of: credit-types-treatment-unspecified, exclude-all-credits,
        include-all-credits.

     --display-name=DISPLAY_NAME

        characters.

     --filter-labels=FILTER_LABELS
        Single label and value pair specifying that usage from only this set of
        labeled resources should be included in the budget. Currently, multiple
        entries or multiple values per entry are not allowed. If omitted, the
        report will include all labeled and unlabeled usage.

     --filter-projects=[FILTER_PROJECTS,...]
        Set of projects in the form projects/{project_id}, specifying that
        usage from only this set of projects should be included in the budget.
        If omitted, all projects will be included.

     --filter-services=[FILTER_SERVICES,...]
        Set of services of the form services/{service_id}, specifying that
        usage from only this set of services should be included in the budget.
        If omitted, the report will include usage for all services. The service
        names are available through the Catalog API:

        budget. If a subaccount is set to the name of the parent account, usage
        from the parent account will be included. If omitted, the report will
        include usage from the parent account and all subaccounts, if they
        exist.

     At most one of these may be specified:

          must be the currency associated with the billing account.

       --last-period-amount
          Use the amount of last period's budget.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --threshold-rules-from-file=THRESHOLD_RULES_FROM_FILE
          Import a file with the updated threshold rules. The threshold rules

       --add-threshold-rule=ADD_THRESHOLD_RULE
          Rule that triggers alerts (notifications of thresholds being crossed)
          when spend exceeds the specified percentages of the budget. This flag
          can be repeated to provide multiple thresholds above which an alert
          is sent.

       percent
          Integer between 0 and 100 above which an alert is sent.

       basis
          Type of basis used to determine if spend has passed the threshold.

          defaults to 'current-spend' if not set.

       --clear-threshold-rules
          Removes all threshold rules from the budget.

    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
