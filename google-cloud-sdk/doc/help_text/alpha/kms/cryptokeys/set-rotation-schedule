NAME
    gcloud alpha kms cryptokeys set-rotation-schedule - update the rotation
        schedule for a CryptoKey

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha kms cryptokeys set-rotation-schedule KEY [--keyring=KEYRING]
        [--location=LOCATION] [--next-rotation-time=NEXT_ROTATION_TIME]
        [--rotation-period=ROTATION_PERIOD] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) (REMOVED) Update the rotation schedule for a CryptoKey.

    The command group cryptokeys is deprecated, please use the keys command
    group.

    Updates the rotation schedule for the given CryptoKey. The schedule
    automatically creates a new primary CryptoKeyVersion for the CryptoKey
    according to the --next-rotation-time and --rotation-period flags.

    The flag --next-rotation-time must be in ISO or RFC3339 format, and
    --rotation-period must be in the form INTEGER[UNIT], where units can be one
    of seconds (s), minutes (m), hours (h) or days (d).

    Key rotations performed manually via update-primary-version and the
    CryptoKeyVersion create do not affect the stored --next-rotation-time.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     KEY
        Name of the key to update the schedule of.

FLAGS
     --keyring=KEYRING
        The containing keyring.

     --location=LOCATION
        The location of the requested resource.

     --next-rotation-time=NEXT_ROTATION_TIME

        for information on time formats.

     --rotation-period=ROTATION_PERIOD
