        CryptoKey

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha kms cryptokeys versions list [--key=KEY] [--keyring=KEYRING]
        [--location=LOCATION] [--filter=EXPRESSION] [--limit=LIMIT]
        [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE] [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]] [--uri]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) (REMOVED) List the versions within a CryptoKey.

    The command group cryptokeys is deprecated, please use the keys command
    group.

    Lists all of the CryptoKeyVersions within the given CryptoKey.

FLAGS
     --key=KEY
        The containing key.

     --keyring=KEYRING
        Key ring of the key.

     --location=LOCATION
        Location of the keyring.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        The maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        A comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --uri
        Print a list of resource URIs instead of the default output.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    The following command lists all CryptoKeyVersions within the CryptoKey
    frodo, KeyRing fellowship, and Location global:

        $ gcloud alpha kms cryptokeys versions list --location global \
            --keyring fellowship \
            --cryptokey frodo
