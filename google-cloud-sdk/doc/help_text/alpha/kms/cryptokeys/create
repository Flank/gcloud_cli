SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha kms cryptokeys create KEY --purpose=PURPOSE
        [--keyring=KEYRING] [--location=LOCATION]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) (REMOVED) Create a new CryptoKey.

    The command group cryptokeys is deprecated, please use the keys command
    group.

    Creates a new CryptoKey within the given KeyRing.

    The optional flags --rotation-period and --next-rotation-time define a
    rotation schedule for the CryptoKey. A schedule can also be defined by the
    create-rotation-schedule command.

    The flag --next-rotation-time must be in ISO or RFC3339 format, and
    --rotation-period must be in the form INTEGER[UNIT], where units can be one
    of seconds (s), minutes (m), hours (h) or days (d).

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     KEY
        Name of the key to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --purpose=PURPOSE
        The "purpose" of the CryptoKey. PURPOSE must be (currently only one
        value is supported): encryption.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --keyring=KEYRING
        Key ring of the key.

     --location=LOCATION
        Location of the key.

     --next-rotation-time=NEXT_ROTATION_TIME
        Next automatic rotation time of the key. See $ gcloud topic datetimes
        for information on time formats.

     --rotation-period=ROTATION_PERIOD
        Automatic rotation period of the key. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for
        information on duration formats.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    The following command creates a CryptoKey named frodo within the KeyRing
    fellowship and location us-east1:

        $ gcloud alpha kms cryptokeys create frodo \
            --location us-east1 \
            --keyring fellowship \
            --purpose encryption

    The following command creates a CryptoKey named strider within the KeyRing
    rangers and location global with a specified rotation schedule:

        $ gcloud alpha kms cryptokeys create strider \
            --location global --keyring rangers \
            --purpose encryption \
            --rotation-period 30d \
            --next-rotation-time 2017-10-12T12:34:56.1234Z
