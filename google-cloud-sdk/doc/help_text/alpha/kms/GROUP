NAME
    gcloud alpha kms - manage cryptographic keys in the cloud

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha kms GROUP | COMMAND [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) The gcloud kms command group lets you generate, use, rotate and
    destroy Google Cloud KMS keys.

    Cloud KMS is a cloud-hosted key management service that lets you manage
    encryption for your cloud services the same way you do on-premises. You can
    generate, use, rotate and destroy AES256 encryption keys. Cloud KMS is
    integrated with IAM and Cloud Audit Logging so that you can manage
    permissions on individual keys, and monitor how these are used. Use Cloud
    KMS to protect secrets and other sensitive data which you need to store in
    Google Cloud Platform.

    More information on Cloud KMS can be found here:
