NAME
    gcloud alpha ai-platform models remove-iam-policy-binding - remove IAM
        policy binding for a model

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha ai-platform models remove-iam-policy-binding MODEL
        --member=MEMBER --role=ROLE [--region=REGION]
        [--all | --condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          | --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Remove an IAM policy binding from the IAM policy of a ML model. One
    binding consists of a member, a role, and an optional condition. See $
    gcloud alpha ai-platform models get-iam-policy for examples of how to
    specify a model resource.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Model resource - The AI Platform model for which to remove IAM policy
     binding from. This represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are
     not given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the
     [project] attribute: provide the argument [model] on the command line with
     a fully specified name; provide the argument [--project] on the command
     line; set the property [core/project]. This must be specified.

       MODEL
          ID of the model or fully qualified identifier for the model.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --member=MEMBER
        The member to remove the binding for. Should be of the form
        user|group|serviceAccount:email or domain:domain.

        Examples: user:test-user@gmail.com, group:admins@example.com,
        serviceAccount:test123@example.domain.com, or
        domain:example.domain.com.

        Can also be one of the following special values:
        * allUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone who is on the
          internet, with or without a Google account.
        * allAuthenticatedUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone
          who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account.

     --role=ROLE
        The role to remove the member from.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        Google Cloud region of the regional endpoint to use for this command.
        If unspecified, the command uses the global endpoint of the AI Platform
        Training and Prediction API.

        Learn more about regional endpoints and see a list of available
        regions:
        https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/prediction/docs/regional-endpoints

        REGION must be one of: asia-east1, europe-west4, us-central1.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --all
          Remove all bindings with this role and member, irrespective of any
          conditions.

       --condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          The condition of the binding to be removed. When the condition is
          explicitly specified as None (--condition=None), it matches a binding
          without a condition. Otherwise, only the binding with a condition
          which exactly matches the specified condition (including the optional
          description) will be removed.

       expression
          (Required) Expression of the condition which evaluates to True or
          False. This uses a subset of Common Expression Language syntax.

       title
          (Required) A short string describing the purpose of the expression.

       description
          (Optional) Additional description for the expression.

          NOTE: An unsatisfied condition will not allow access via this
          binding.

       --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE
          Path to a local JSON or YAML file that defines the condition. To see
          available fields, see the help for --condition.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To remove an IAM policy binding for the role of 'roles/ml.admin' for the
    user 'test-user@gmail.com' on model with identifier 'my_model', run:

        $ gcloud alpha ai-platform models remove-iam-policy-binding \
            my_model --member='user:test-user@gmail.com' \
            --role='roles/ml.admin'

    To remove an IAM policy binding for the role of 'roles/ml.admin' from all
    authenticated users on model 'my_model', run:

        $ gcloud alpha ai-platform models remove-iam-policy-binding \
            my_model --member='allAuthenticatedUsers' \
            --role='roles/ml.admin'

    See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details of
    policy role and member types.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud ai-platform models remove-iam-policy-binding
        $ gcloud beta ai-platform models remove-iam-policy-binding
