NAME
    gcloud alpha ai-platform models add-iam-policy-binding - add IAM policy
        binding for a model

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha ai-platform models add-iam-policy-binding MODEL
        --member=MEMBER --role=ROLE [--region=REGION]
        [--condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          | --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Adds a policy binding to the IAM policy of a ML engine model, given
    a model ID and the binding. One binding consists of a member, a role, and
    an optional condition.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     MODEL
        Name of the model.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --member=MEMBER
        The member to add the binding for. Should be of the form
        user|group|serviceAccount:email or domain:domain.

        Examples: user:test-user@gmail.com, group:admins@example.com,
        serviceAccount:test123@example.domain.com, or
        domain:example.domain.com.

        Can also be one of the following special values:
        * allUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone who is on the
          internet, with or without a Google account.
        * allAuthenticatedUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone
          who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account.

     --role=ROLE
        Define the role of the member.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        Google Cloud region of the regional endpoint to use for this command.
        If unspecified, the command uses the global endpoint of the AI Platform
        Training and Prediction API.

        Learn more about regional endpoints and see a list of available
        regions:
        https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/prediction/docs/regional-endpoints

        REGION must be one of: asia-east1, europe-west4, us-central1.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          The condition of the binding to be added. When the condition is
          explicitly specified as None (--condition=None), a binding without a
          condition is added. When the condition is specified and is not None,
          --role cannot be a primitive role. Primitive roles are roles/editor,
          roles/owner, and roles/viewer.

       expression
          (Required) Expression of the condition which evaluates to True or
          False. This uses a subset of Common Expression Language syntax.

       title
          (Required) A short string describing the purpose of the expression.

       description
          (Optional) Additional description for the expression.

          NOTE: An unsatisfied condition will not allow access via this
          binding.

       --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE
          Path to a local JSON or YAML file that defines the condition. To see
          available fields, see the help for --condition.

EXAMPLES
    To add an IAM policy binding for the role of 'roles/ml.admin' for the user
    'test-user@gmail.com' on a model with identifier 'my_model', run:

        $ gcloud alpha ai-platform models add-iam-policy-binding my_model \
            --member='user:test-user@gmail.com' --role='roles/ml.admin'

    To add an IAM policy binding for the role of 'roles/ml.admin' to the
    service account 'test-proj1@example.domain.com', run:

        $ gcloud alpha ai-platform models add-iam-policy-binding my_model \
            --member='serviceAccount:test-proj1@example.domain.com' \
            --role='roles/ml.admin'

    To add an IAM policy binding for the role of 'roles/ml.admin' for all
    authenticated users on a model with identifier 'my_model', run:

        $ gcloud alpha ai-platform models add-iam-policy-binding my_model \
            --member='allAuthenticatedUsers' --role='roles/ml.admin'

    To add an IAM policy binding which expires at the end of the year 2018 for
    the role of 'roles/ml.admin' and the user 'test-user@gmail.com' on a model
    with identifier 'my_model', run:

        $ gcloud alpha ai-platform models add-iam-policy-binding my_model \
            --member='user:test-user@gmail.com' --role='roles/ml.admin' \
            --condition='expression=request.time <
         timestamp("2019-01-01T00:00:00Z"),title=expires_end_of_2018,descrip\
