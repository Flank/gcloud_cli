DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Creates one or more Cloud Pub/Sub snapshots. This feature is part
    of an invitation-only release of the underlying Cloud Pub/Sub API. The
    command will generate errors unless you have access to this API. This
    restriction should be relaxed in the near future. Please contact
    cloud-pubsub@google.com with any questions in the meantime.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     SNAPSHOT [SNAPSHOT ...]
        One or more snapshot names to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --subscription=SUBSCRIPTION
        The subscription whose backlog the snapshot retains. Specifically, the
        created snapshot is guaranteed to retain a) The existing backlog on the
        subscription, i.e., the set of messages in the subscription that are
        unacknowledged upon the successful completion of the create snapshot
        request, b) Any messages published to the subscription's topic
        following the successful creation of the snapshot.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     --subscription-project=SUBSCRIPTION_PROJECT
        The name of the project the provided subscription belongs to. If not
        set, it defaults to the currently selected cloud project.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
    https://cloud.google.com/support/.
