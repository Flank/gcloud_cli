        following the successful creation of the snapshot.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     --subscription-project=SUBSCRIPTION_PROJECT
        The name of the project the provided subscription belongs to. If not
        set, it defaults to the currently selected cloud project.

    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this

    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
    https://cloud.google.com/support/. This variant is also available:
