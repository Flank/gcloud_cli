DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Describes a Cloud Pub/Sub snapshot. This feature is part of an
    invitation-only release of the underlying Cloud Pub/Sub API. The command
    will generate errors unless you have access to this API. This restriction
    should be relaxed in the near future. Please contact
    cloud-pubsub@google.com with any questions in the meantime.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. Usually,
    users of ALPHA commands and flags need to apply for access, agree to
    applicable terms, and have their projects whitelisted. Contact Google or
    sign up on a product's page for ALPHA access. Product pages can be found at
