NAME
    gcloud alpha pubsub topics update - this feature is part of an invite-only
        release of the Cloud Pub/Sub API

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha pubsub topics update TOPIC
        [--recompute-message-storage-policy] [--update-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]]
        [--clear-labels | --remove-labels=[KEY,...]] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Updates an existing Cloud Pub/Sub topic. This feature is part of an
    invitation-only release of the underlying Cloud Pub/Sub API. The command
    will generate errors unless you have access to this API. This restriction
    should be relaxed in the near future. Please contact
    cloud-pubsub@google.com with any questions in the meantime.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Topic resource - Name of the topic to update. This represents a Cloud
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways. To set the [project] attribute: provide the
     argument [topic] on the command line with a fully specified name; provide
     the argument [--project] on the command line; set the property
     [core/project]. This must be specified.

       TOPIC
          ID of the topic or fully qualified identifier for the topic.

FLAGS
     --recompute-message-storage-policy
        If given, Cloud Pub/Sub will recompute the regions where messages can
        be stored at rest based on your organization's policies.

     --update-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        A list of label KEY=VALUE pairs to update. If a label exists its value
        is modified, otherwise a new label is created.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --clear-labels
          Removes all labels. If --update-labels is also specified then
          --clear-labels is applied first.

          For example, to remove all labels:

              $ gcloud alpha pubsub topics update --clear-labels

          To set the labels to exactly "foo" and "baz":

              $ gcloud alpha pubsub topics update --clear-labels \
                --update-labels foo=bar,baz=qux

       --remove-labels=[KEY,...]
          A list of label keys to remove. If a label does not exist it is
          silently ignored.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
    https://cloud.google.com/support/.
