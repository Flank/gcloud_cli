        release of the Cloud Pub/Sub API

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha pubsub topics update TOPIC [--update-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]]
        [--clear-labels | --remove-labels=[KEY,...]] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Updates an existing Cloud Pub/Sub topic. This feature is part of an
    invitation-only release of the underlying Cloud Pub/Sub API. The command
    will generate errors unless you have access to this API. This restriction
    should be relaxed in the near future. Please contact
    cloud-pubsub@google.com with any questions in the meantime.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     TOPIC - Name of the topic to update. This represents a Cloud resource.
     (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be
     set in other ways. To set the [project] attribute: Set the property
     [core/project] or provide the flag [--project] on the command line. This
     must be specified.

       TOPIC
          The ID of the topic or a fully qualified identifier for the topic.

FLAGS
     --update-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        A list of label KEY=VALUE pairs to update. If a label exists its value
        is modified, otherwise a new label is created.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --clear-labels
          Removes all labels. If --update-labels is also specified then
          --clear-labels is applied first.

          For example, to remove all labels:

              $ gcloud alpha pubsub topics update --clear-labels

          To set the labels to exactly "foo" and "baz":

              $ gcloud alpha pubsub topics update --clear-labels \
                --update-labels foo=bar,baz=qux

       --remove-labels=[KEY,...]
          A list of label keys to remove. If a label does not exist it is
          silently ignored.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. Usually,
    users of ALPHA commands and flags need to apply for access, agree to
    applicable terms, and have their projects whitelisted. Contact Google or
    sign up on a product's page for ALPHA access. Product pages can be found at
    https://cloud.google.com/products/.
