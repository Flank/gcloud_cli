NAME
    gcloud alpha pubsub topics set-iam-policy - set the IAM policy for a Cloud
        Pub/Sub Topic

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha pubsub topics set-iam-policy TOPIC POLICY_FILE
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) This command replaces the existing IAM policy for a topic, given a
    topic and a file encoded in JSON or YAML that contains the IAM policy. If
    the given policy file specifies an "etag" value, then the replacement will
    succeed only if the policy already in place matches that etag. (An etag
    obtained via get-iam-policy will prevent the replacement if the policy for
    the topic has been subsequently updated.) A policy file that does not
    contain an etag value will replace any existing policy for the topic.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Topic resource - The topic for which to set the IAM policy. This
     represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the [project]
     attribute: provide the argument [topic] on the command line with a fully
     specified name; provide the argument [--project] on the command line; set
     the property [core/project]. This must be specified.

       TOPIC
          ID of the topic or fully qualified identifier for the topic.

     POLICY_FILE
        Path to a local JSON or YAML formatted file containing a valid policy.

        The output of the get-iam-policy command is a valid file, as is any
        JSON or YAML file conforming to the structure of a Policy
        (https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/Policy).

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the pubsub/v1 API. The full documentation for this API
    can be found at: https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs

EXAMPLES
    The following command will read an IAM policy defined in a JSON file
    'policy.json' and set it for a topic with identifier 'my-topic'

        $ gcloud alpha pubsub topics set-iam-policy my-topic policy.json

        See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details of the
        policy file format and contents.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
    https://cloud.google.com/support/. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta pubsub topics set-iam-policy
