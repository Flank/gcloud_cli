NAME
    gcloud alpha pubsub subscriptions set-iam-policy - set the IAM policy for a
        Cloud Pub/Sub Subscription

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha pubsub subscriptions set-iam-policy SUBSCRIPTION POLICY_FILE
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) This command replaces the existing IAM policy for a subscription,
    given a subscription and a file encoded in JSON or YAML that contains the
    IAM policy.

    If the given policy file specifies an "etag" value, then the replacement
    will succeed only if the policy already in place matches that etag. (An
    etag obtained via get-iam-policy will prevent the replacement if the policy
    for the subscription has been subsequently updated.) A policy file that
    does not contain an etag value will replace any existing policy for the
    subscription.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Subscription resource - The subscription for which to set the IAM policy.
     This represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the [project]
     attribute: provide the flag [subscription] on the command line with a
     fully specified name; provide the flag [--project] on the command line;
     set the property [core/project]. This must be specified.

       SUBSCRIPTION
          The ID of the subscription or a fully qualified identifier for the
          subscription.

     POLICY_FILE
        Path to a local JSON or YAML formatted file containing a valid policy.

        The output of the get-iam-policy command is a valid file, as is any
        JSON or YAML file conforming to the structure of a Policy
        (https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/Policy).
