DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) This method is useful to indicate that more time is needed to
    process a message by the subscriber, or to make the message available for
    redelivery if the processing was interrupted.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Subscription resource - Name of the subscription messages belong to. This
     represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the [project]
     attribute: provide the flag [subscription] on the command line with a
     fully specified name; provide the flag [--project] on the command line;
     set the property [core/project]. This must be specified.

       SUBSCRIPTION
          The ID of the subscription or a fully qualified identifier for the
          subscription.

     [ACK_ID ...]
        (DEPRECATED) One or more ACK_ID to modify the deadline for.

        Positional argument ACK_ID is deprecated. Please use --ack-ids instead.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --ack-deadline=ACK_DEADLINE
        The number of seconds the system will wait for a subscriber to
        acknowledge receiving a message before re-attempting delivery.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --ack-ids=[ACK_ID,...]
        One or more ACK_ID to modify the deadline for.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.
