SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha pubsub subscriptions modify-ack-deadline SUBSCRIPTION

        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) (DEPRECATED) Modifies the ACK deadline for a specific Cloud Pub/Sub
    message.

    This command has been renamed. Please use modify-message-ack-deadline
    instead.

    This method is useful to indicate that more time is needed to process a
    message by the subscriber, or to make the message available for redelivery
    if the processing was interrupted.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Subscription resource - Name of the subscription messages belong to. This
     represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the [project]
     attribute: provide the flag [subscription] on the command line with a
     fully specified name; provide the flag [--project] on the command line;
     set the property [core/project]. This must be specified.

       SUBSCRIPTION
          The ID of the subscription or a fully qualified identifier for the
          subscription.

     [ACK_ID ...]
        (DEPRECATED) One or more ACK_ID to modify the deadline for.

        Positional argument ACK_ID is deprecated. Please use --ack-ids instead.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --ack-deadline=ACK_DEADLINE
        The number of seconds the system will wait for a subscriber to
        acknowledge receiving a message before re-attempting delivery.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --ack-ids=[ACK_ID,...]
        One or more ACK_ID to modify the deadline for.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. Usually,
    users of ALPHA commands and flags need to apply for access, agree to
    applicable terms, and have their projects whitelisted. Contact Google or
