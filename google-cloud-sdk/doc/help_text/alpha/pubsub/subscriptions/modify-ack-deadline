DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) (DEPRECATED) Modifies the ACK deadline for a specific Cloud Pub/Sub
    message.

    This command has been renamed. Please use modify-message-ack-deadline

    message by the subscriber, or to make the message available for redelivery
    if the processing was interrupted.

     [ACK_ID ...]
        (DEPRECATED) One or more ACK_ID to modify the deadline for.

        Positional argument ACK_ID is deprecated. Please use --ack-ids instead.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --ack-deadline=ACK_DEADLINE
        The number of seconds the system will wait for a subscriber to
        acknowledge receiving a message before re-attempting delivery.

OPTIONAL FLAGS

        One or more ACK_ID to modify the deadline for.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.
