DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Updates an existing Cloud Pub/Sub subscription. This feature is
    part of an invitation-only release of the underlying Cloud Pub/Sub API. The
    command will generate errors unless you have access to this API. This
    restriction should be relaxed in the near future. Please contact
    cloud-pubsub@google.com with any questions in the meantime.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Subscription resource - Name of the subscription to update. This
     represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the [project]
     attribute: provide the flag [subscription] on the command line with a
     fully specified name; provide the flag [--project] on the command line;
     set the property [core/project]. This must be specified.

       SUBSCRIPTION
          The ID of the subscription or a fully qualified identifier for the
          subscription.

FLAGS
     --ack-deadline=ACK_DEADLINE
        The number of seconds the system will wait for a subscriber to
        acknowledge receiving a message before re-attempting delivery.

     --message-retention-duration=MESSAGE_RETENTION_DURATION
        How long to retain unacknowledged messages in the subscription's
        backlog, from the moment a message is published. If
        --retain-acked-messages is true, this also configures the retention of
        acknowledged messages. Specify "default" to use the default value.
        Valid values are strings of the form INTEGER[UNIT], where UNIT is one
        of "s", "m", "h", and "d" for seconds, seconds, minutes, hours, and
        days, respectively. If the unit is omitted, seconds is assumed.

     --push-endpoint=PUSH_ENDPOINT
        A URL to use as the endpoint for this subscription. This will also
        automatically set the subscription type to PUSH.

     --retain-acked-messages
        Whether or not to retain acknowledged messages. If true, messages are
        not expunged from the subscription's backlog until they fall out of the
        --message-retention-duration window.

     --update-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        A list of label KEY=VALUE pairs to update. If a label exists its value
        is modified, otherwise a new label is created.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --clear-labels
          Removes all labels. If --update-labels is also specified then
          --clear-labels is applied first.

          For example, to remove all labels:

              $ gcloud alpha pubsub subscriptions update --clear-labels

          To set the labels to exactly "foo" and "baz":

              $ gcloud alpha pubsub subscriptions update --clear-labels \
                --update-labels foo=bar,baz=qux

       --remove-labels=[KEY,...]
          A list of label keys to remove. If a label does not exist it is
          silently ignored.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
