SYNOPSIS

        [--ack-deadline=ACK_DEADLINE] [--labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Creates one or more Cloud Pub/Sub subscriptions for a given topic.
    The new subscription defaults to a PULL subscription unless a push endpoint
    is specified.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     SUBSCRIPTION [SUBSCRIPTION ...]
        One or more subscriptions to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     TOPIC - Name of the topic from which this subscription is receiving
     messages. Each subscription is attached to a single topic. The arguments
     in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. This
     must be specified.

       --topic=TOPIC
          The ID of the topic or a fully qualified identifier for the topic.
          This flag must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
          group are specified.

       --topic-project=TOPIC_PROJECT
          The Cloud project for the topic. If not set, it will use the project
          set in properties.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --ack-deadline=ACK_DEADLINE
        The number of seconds the system will wait for a subscriber to
        acknowledge receiving a message before re-attempting delivery.

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        A list of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

     --message-retention-duration=MESSAGE_RETENTION_DURATION
        How long to retain unacknowledged messages in the subscription's
        backlog, from the moment a message is published. If
        --retain-acked-messages is true, this also configures the retention of
        acknowledged messages. The default value is 7 days, the minimum is 10
        minutes, and the maximum is 7 days. Valid values are strings of the
        form INTEGER[UNIT], where UNIT is one of "s", "m", "h", and "d" for
        seconds, seconds, minutes, hours, and days, respectively. If the unit
        is omitted, seconds is assumed.

     --push-endpoint=PUSH_ENDPOINT
        A URL to use as the endpoint for this subscription. This will also
        automatically set the subscription type to PUSH.

     --retain-acked-messages
        Whether or not to retain acknowledged messages. If true, messages are
        not expunged from the subscription's backlog until they fall out of the
        --message-retention-duration window.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.
