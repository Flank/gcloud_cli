DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Creates one or more Cloud Pub/Sub subscriptions for a given topic.
    The new subscription defaults to a PULL subscription unless a push endpoint
    is specified.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Subscription resource - One or more subscriptions to create. This
     represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the [project]
     attribute: provide the argument [subscription] on the command line with a
     fully specified name; provide the argument [--project] on the command
     line; set the property [core/project]. This must be specified.

       SUBSCRIPTION [SUBSCRIPTION ...]
          IDs of the subscriptions or fully qualified identifiers for the
          subscriptions.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Topic resource - Name of the topic from which this subscription is
     receiving messages. Each subscription is attached to a single topic. The
     arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. This must be specified.

       --topic=TOPIC
          ID of the topic or fully qualified identifier for the topic. This
          flag must be specified if any of the other arguments in this group
          are specified.

       --topic-project=TOPIC_PROJECT
          The Cloud project for the topic.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --ack-deadline=ACK_DEADLINE
        The number of seconds the system will wait for a subscriber to
        acknowledge receiving a message before re-attempting delivery.

     --expiration-period=EXPIRATION_PERIOD
        The subscription will expire if it is inactive for the given period.
        Valid values are strings of the form INTEGER[UNIT], where UNIT is one
        of "s", "m", "h", and "d" for seconds, minutes, hours, and days,
        respectively. If the unit is omitted, seconds is assumed. This flag
        additionally accepts the special value "never" to indicate that the
        subscription will never expire.

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     --message-retention-duration=MESSAGE_RETENTION_DURATION
        How long to retain unacknowledged messages in the subscription's
        backlog, from the moment a message is published. If
        --retain-acked-messages is true, this also configures the retention of
        acknowledged messages. The default value is 7 days, the minimum is 10
        minutes, and the maximum is 7 days. Valid values are strings of the
        form INTEGER[UNIT], where UNIT is one of "s", "m", "h", and "d" for
        seconds, minutes, hours, and days, respectively. If the unit is
        omitted, seconds is assumed.

     --push-auth-service-account=SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL
        Service account email used as the identity for the generated Open ID
        Connect token for authenticated push.

     --push-auth-token-audience=OPTIONAL_AUDIENCE_OVERRIDE
        Audience used in the generated Open ID Connect token for authenticated
        push. If not specified, it will be set to the push-endpoint.

     --push-endpoint=PUSH_ENDPOINT
        A URL to use as the endpoint for this subscription. This will also
        automatically set the subscription type to PUSH.

     --retain-acked-messages
        Whether or not to retain acknowledged messages. If true, messages are
        not expunged from the subscription's backlog until they fall out of the
        --message-retention-duration window.
