NAME
    gcloud alpha pubsub subscriptions seek - this feature is part of an
        invite-only release of the Cloud Pub/Sub API

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha pubsub subscriptions seek SUBSCRIPTION
        (--snapshot=SNAPSHOT | --time=TIME)
        [--snapshot-project=SNAPSHOT_PROJECT] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Resets a subscription's backlog to a point in time or to a given
    snapshot. This feature is part of an invitation-only release of the
    underlying Cloud Pub/Sub API. The command will generate errors unless you
    have access to this API. This restriction should be relaxed in the near
    future. Please contact cloud-pubsub@google.com with any questions in the
    meantime.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Subscription resource - Name of the subscription to affect. This
     represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the [project]
     attribute: Set the property [core/project] or provide the flag [--project]
     on the command line. This must be specified.

       SUBSCRIPTION
          The ID of the subscription or a fully qualified identifier for the
          subscription.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --snapshot=SNAPSHOT
          The name of the snapshot. The snapshot's topic must be the same as
          that of the subscription.

       --time=TIME
          The time to seek to. Messages in the subscription that were published
          before this time are marked as acknowledged, and messages retained in
          the subscription that were published after this time are marked as
          unacknowledged. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on time
          formats.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --snapshot-project=SNAPSHOT_PROJECT
        The name of the project the snapshot belongs to (if seeking to a
        snapshot). If not set, it defaults to the currently selected cloud
        project.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. Usually,
    users of ALPHA commands and flags need to apply for access, agree to
    applicable terms, and have their projects whitelisted. Contact Google or
    sign up on a product's page for ALPHA access. Product pages can be found at
