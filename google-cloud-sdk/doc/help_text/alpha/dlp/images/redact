NAME
    gcloud alpha dlp images redact - redact potentially sensitive data from
        image content

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha dlp images redact IMAGE --info-types=[INFOTYPE,...]
        [--include-quote] [--min-likelihood=MIN_LIKELIHOOD; default="possible"]
        [--redact-all-text] [--redact-color=REDACT_COLOR]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Redact potentially sensitive data from image content.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     IMAGE
        Image file to search for sensitive info. The file type must be one of
        PNG, JPEG, SVG, or BMP.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --info-types=[INFOTYPE,...]
        Which infoTypes to look for. The values must correspond to InfoType
        values found in documentation. For more information about valid
        infoTypes, see InfoTypes Reference
        (https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/infotypes-reference)

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --include-quote
        If True, the server will attempt to filter out profanities, replacing
        all but the initial character in each filtered word with asterisks,
        e.g. \"f**\".

     --min-likelihood=MIN_LIKELIHOOD; default="possible"
        Only return findings equal to or above this threshold. One of:
        very-unlikely, unlikely, possible, likely, very-likely. The default
        value is possible. MIN_LIKELIHOOD must be one of: likely, possible,
        unlikely, very-likely, very-unlikely.

     --redact-all-text
        If specified, all text info in the image will be removed, whether it is
        detected as sensitive or not.

     --redact-color=REDACT_COLOR
        The color to use when redacting content from an image. If not
        specified, the default value is black. Colors should be specified as a
        string of r,g,b float values in the interval [0,1] representing the
        amount of red, green, and blue in the color, respectively. For example,
        black = 0,0,0, red = 1.0,0,0, white = 1.0,1.0,1.0, and so on.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.
