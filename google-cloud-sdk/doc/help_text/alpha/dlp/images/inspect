DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Finds potentially sensitive data in image content.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     IMAGE
        Image file to search for sensitive info. The file type must be one of
        PNG, JPEG, SVG, or BMP.

FLAGS

     --include-quote
        If True, the server will attempt to filter out profanities, replacing
        all but the initial character in each filtered word with asterisks,
        e.g. "f**".

     --info-types=[INFOTYPE,...]
        Which infoTypes to scan input for. The values must correspond to
        infoType values found in documentation. For more information about
        valid infoTypes, see infoTypes Reference
        (https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/infotypes-reference)

     --max-findings=MAX_FINDINGS
        Maximum number of findings that will be returned per execution.

        If not specified, no limits are applied.

     --min-likelihood=MIN_LIKELIHOOD; default="possible"
        Only return findings equal to or above this threshold. MIN_LIKELIHOOD
        must be one of: likely, possible, unlikely, very-likely, very-unlikely.
