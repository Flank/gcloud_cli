        [--min-likelihood=MIN_LIKELIHOOD; default="possible"]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Finds potentially sensitive data in image content.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     IMAGE
        Image file to search for sensitive info. The file type must be one of
        PNG, JPEG, SVG, or BMP.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --info-types=[INFOTYPE,...]
        Which infoTypes to scan input for. The values must correspond to
        infoType values found in documentation. For more information about
        valid infoTypes, see infoTypes Reference
        (https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/infotypes-reference)

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --exclude-info-types
        Whether or not to exclude type information of the findings. Type
        information is included by default.

     --include-quote
        If True, the server will attempt to filter out profanities, replacing
        all but the initial character in each filtered word with asterisks,
        e.g. "f**".

     --max-findings=MAX_FINDINGS; default=1000
        Maximum number of findings that will be returned per execution.

        If not specified, will return up to the system maximum of 1000
        findings.

     --min-likelihood=MIN_LIKELIHOOD; default="possible"
        Only return findings equal to or above this threshold. MIN_LIKELIHOOD
        must be one of: likely, possible, unlikely, very-likely, very-unlikely.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.
