DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Schedules a job to inspect content in a Google Cloud Storage bucket
    for sensitive data.

    See Inspecting Storage and Databases for Sensitive Data
    (https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/inspecting-storage) for more details.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     PATH
        Google Cloud Storage URL to scan for files with optional wildcard
        character (*) -- for example, gs://my-bucket/*.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --info-types=[INFOTYPE,...]
        Which infoTypes to scan input for. The values must correspond to
        infoType values found in documentation. For more information about
        valid infoTypes, see infoTypes Reference
        (https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/infotypes-reference)

     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --output-tables=[OUTPUT_TABLES,...]
          Publishes results of a Cloud DLP job to one or more BigQuery tables.
          BigQuery tables are uniquely identified by their project_id,
          dataset_id, and table_id in the format
          <project_id>.<dataset_id>.<table_id>.

       --output-topics=[OUTPUT_TOPICS,...]
          Publishes the results of a Cloud DLP job to one or more Cloud Pub/Sub
          topics.

          Note: The topic must have given publishing access rights to the DLP
          API service account executing the Cloud DLP job.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --exclude-info-types
        Whether or not to exclude type information of the findings. Type
        information is included by default.

     --file-size-limit=FILE_SIZE_LIMIT; default=1024
        Integer indicating max number of bytes to scan from a file. If a
        scanned file's size is bigger than this value, then the rest of the
        bytes are omitted. The default value is 1024.

     --include-quote
        If True, the server will attempt to filter out profanities, replacing
        all but the initial character in each filtered word with asterisks,
        e.g. "f**".

     --job-id=JOB_ID
        Optional job ID to use for the created job. If not provided, a job ID
        will automatically be generated. Must be unique within the project. The
        job ID can contain uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and
        hyphens; that is, it must match the regular expression: [a-zA-Z\\d-]+.
        The maximum length is 100 characters. Can be empty to allow the system
        to generate one.

     --max-findings=MAX_FINDINGS; default=1000
        Maximum number of findings that will be returned per execution.

        If not specified, will return up to the system maximum of 1000
        findings.

     --max-findings-per-item=MAX_FINDINGS_PER_ITEM
        Maximum number of findings that will be returned for each item scanned.

        If not specified, no limits are applied.

     --max-time=MAX_TIME
        Scan will include items in repository whose age is >= min-time and <=
        max-time.

        If max-time is omitted then there is no maximum time limit.

        See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on time formats.

     --min-likelihood=MIN_LIKELIHOOD; default="possible"
        Only return findings equal to or above this threshold. MIN_LIKELIHOOD
        must be one of: likely, possible, unlikely, very-likely, very-unlikely.

     --min-time=MIN_TIME
        Scan will include items in repository whose age is >= min-time and <=
        max-time.

        If max-time is omitted then there is no maximum time limit.

        See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on time formats.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the dlp/v2 API. The full documentation for this API can
    be found at: https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/

EXAMPLES
    The following command creates a job my-gcs-job to scan files in the Google
    Cloud Storage path gs://testproject/dlp/:

        $ gcloud alpha dlp datasources gcs inspect  \
            `gs://testproject/dlp/*` --job-id my-gcs-job \
            --file-size-limit 10000 --min-time '2018-01-01T12:00:00Z' \
            --max-time '2018-01-31T12:00:00Z' --output-topics my-topic \
            --max-findings-per-item 3 --max-findings 1000 \
            --info-types PHONE_NUMBER,EMAIL_ADDRESS \
            --min-likelihood very-likely --include-quote \
            --exclude-info-types

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. Usually,
    users of ALPHA commands and flags need to apply for access, agree to
    applicable terms, and have their projects whitelisted. Contact Google or
    sign up on a product's page for ALPHA access. Product pages can be found at
