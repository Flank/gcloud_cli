        content

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha dlp text inspect --info-types=[INFOTYPE,...]
        (--content=CONTENT | --content-file=CONTENT_FILE)
        [--exclude-info-types] [--include-quote]
        [--max-findings=MAX_FINDINGS; default=1000]
        [--min-likelihood=MIN_LIKELIHOOD; default="possible"]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Find potentially sensitive data in text content.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --info-types=[INFOTYPE,...]
        Which infoTypes to look for. The values must correspond to InfoType
        values found in documentation. For more information about valid
        infoTypes, see InfoTypes Reference
        (https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/infotypes-reference)

     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --content=CONTENT
          Text content to inspect for sensitive data.

       --content-file=CONTENT_FILE
          Text file to inspect for sensitive data. Can also be a CSV file
          specifying tabular data. For CSV files, up to 50,000 values per
          request are allowed. To read from stdin pass '-' as the file name.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --exclude-info-types
        Whether or not to exclude type information of the findings. Type
        information is included by default.

     --include-quote
        If True, the server will attempt to filter out profanities, replacing
        all but the initial character in each filtered word with asterisks,
        e.g. \"f**\".

     --max-findings=MAX_FINDINGS; default=1000
        Maximum number of findings that will be returned per execution.

        If not specified, will return up to the system maximum of 1000
        findings.

     --min-likelihood=MIN_LIKELIHOOD; default="possible"
        Only return findings equal to or above this threshold. One of:
        very-unlikely, unlikely, possible, likely, very-likely. The default
        value is possible. MIN_LIKELIHOOD must be one of: likely, possible,
        unlikely, very-likely, very-unlikely.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS

    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
