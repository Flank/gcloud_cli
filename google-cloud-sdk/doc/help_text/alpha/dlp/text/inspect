        content

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha dlp text inspect
        (--content=CONTENT | --content-file=CONTENT_FILE)
        [--exclude-info-types] [--include-quote] [--info-types=[INFOTYPE,...]]
        [--max-findings=MAX_FINDINGS]
        [--min-likelihood=MIN_LIKELIHOOD; default="possible"]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Find potentially sensitive data in text content.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --content=CONTENT
          Text content to inspect for sensitive data.

       --content-file=CONTENT_FILE
          Text file to inspect for sensitive data. Can also be a CSV file
          specifying tabular data. For CSV files, up to 50,000 values per
          request are allowed. To read from stdin pass '-' as the file name.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --exclude-info-types
        Whether or not to exclude type information of the findings. Type
        information is included by default.

     --include-quote
        If True, the server will attempt to filter out profanities, replacing
        all but the initial character in each filtered word with asterisks,
        e.g. "f**".

     --info-types=[INFOTYPE,...]
        Which infoTypes to scan input for. The values must correspond to
        infoType values found in documentation. For more information about
        valid infoTypes, see infoTypes Reference
        (https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/infotypes-reference)

     --max-findings=MAX_FINDINGS
        Maximum number of findings that will be returned per execution.

        If not specified, no limits are applied.

     --min-likelihood=MIN_LIKELIHOOD; default="possible"
        Only return findings equal to or above this threshold. MIN_LIKELIHOOD
        must be one of: likely, possible, unlikely, very-likely, very-unlikely.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
