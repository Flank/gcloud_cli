    gcloud alpha dlp - manage sensitive data with Cloud Data Loss Prevention

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha dlp GROUP [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) The DLP API lets you understand and manage sensitive data. It
    provides fast, scalable classification and optional redaction for sensitive
    data elements like credit card numbers, names, Social Security numbers,
    passport numbers, US and selected international driver's license numbers,
    and phone numbers. The API classifies this data using more than 50
    predefined detectors to identify patterns, formats, and checksums, and even
    understands contextual clues. The API supports text and images; just send
    data to the API or specify data stored on your Google Cloud Storage,
    BigQuery, or Cloud Datastore instances.
