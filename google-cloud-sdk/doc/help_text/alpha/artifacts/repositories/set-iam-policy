NAME
    gcloud alpha artifacts repositories set-iam-policy - set the IAM policy for
        an Artifact Registry repository

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha artifacts repositories set-iam-policy
        (REPOSITORY : --location=LOCATION) POLICY_FILE [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Set the IAM policy associated with an Artifact Registry repository.

    This command can fail for the following reasons:
      o The repository specified does not exist.
      o The active account does not have permission to access the given
        repository's IAM policies.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Repository resource - Name of the Artifact Registry repository. The
     arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways. To set the [project] attribute: provide the
     argument [repository] on the command line with a fully specified name; set
     the property [core/project]; provide the argument [--project] on the
     command line. This must be specified.

       REPOSITORY
          ID of the repository or fully qualified identifier for the
          repository. This positional must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          Location of the repository. Overrides the default artifacts/location
          property value for this command invocation. To configure the default
          location, use the command: gcloud config set artifacts/location.

     POLICY_FILE
        Path to a local JSON or YAML formatted file containing a valid policy.

        The output of the get-iam-policy command is a valid file, as is any
        JSON or YAML file conforming to the structure of a Policy
        (https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/Policy).

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the artifactregistry/v1beta1 API. The full documentation
    for this API can be found at: https://cloud.google.com/artifacts/docs/

EXAMPLES
    To set the IAM policy for my-repository, run:

        $ gcloud alpha artifacts repositories set-iam-policy my-repo \
            policy.json

    See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details of the
    policy file format and contents.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta artifacts repositories set-iam-policy
