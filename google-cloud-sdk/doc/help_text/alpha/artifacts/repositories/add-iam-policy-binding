NAME
    gcloud alpha artifacts repositories add-iam-policy-binding - add an IAM
        policy binding to the IAM policy of an Artifact Registry repository

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha artifacts repositories add-iam-policy-binding
        (REPOSITORY : --location=LOCATION) --member=MEMBER --role=ROLE
        [--condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          | --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha artifacts repositories add-iam-policy-binding adds an
    IAM policy binding to the IAM policy of an Artifact Registry repository.
    One binding consists of a member, a role, and an optional condition.

    This command can fail for the following reasons:
      o The repository specified does not exist.
      o The active account does not have permission to access the given
        repository's IAM policies.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Repository resource - Name of the Artifact Registry repository. The
     arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways. To set the [project] attribute: provide the
     argument [repository] on the command line with a fully specified name; set
     the property [core/project]; provide the argument [--project] on the
     command line. This must be specified.

       REPOSITORY
          ID of the repository or fully qualified identifier for the
          repository. This positional must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          Location of the repository. Overrides the default artifacts/location
          property value for this command invocation. To configure the default
          location, use the command: gcloud config set artifacts/location.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --member=MEMBER
        The member to add the binding for. Should be of the form
        user|group|serviceAccount:email or domain:domain.

        Examples: user:test-user@gmail.com, group:admins@example.com,
        serviceAccount:test123@example.domain.com, or
        domain:example.domain.com.

        Can also be one of the following special values:
        * allUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone who is on the
          internet, with or without a Google account.
        * allAuthenticatedUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone
          who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account.

     --role=ROLE
        Define the role of the member.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     At most one of these may be specified:

       --condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          The condition of the binding to be added. When the condition is
          explicitly specified as None (--condition=None), a binding without a
          condition is added. When the condition is specified and is not None,
          --role cannot be a primitive role. Primitive roles are roles/editor,
          roles/owner, and roles/viewer.

       expression
          (Required) Expression of the condition which evaluates to True or
          False. This uses a subset of Common Expression Language syntax.

       title
          (Required) A short string describing the purpose of the expression.

       description
          (Optional) Additional description for the expression.

          NOTE: An unsatisfied condition will not allow access via this
          binding.

       --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE
          Path to a local JSON or YAML file that defines the condition. To see
          available fields, see the help for --condition.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the artifactregistry/v1beta1 API. The full documentation
    for this API can be found at: https://cloud.google.com/artifacts/docs/

EXAMPLES
    To add an IAM policy binding for the role of 'roles/editor' for the user
    'test-user@gmail.com' with repository 'my-repo', run:

        $ gcloud alpha artifacts repositories add-iam-policy-binding \
            my-repo --member='user:test-user@gmail.com' \
            --role='roles/editor'

    See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details of
    policy role and member types.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta artifacts repositories add-iam-policy-binding
