DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Delete an Artifact Registry package version.

    This command can fail for the following reasons:

      o The active account does not have permission to delete package
        versions.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

     arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways. To set the [project] attribute: provide the
     argument [version] on the command line with a fully specified name; set
     the property [core/project]; provide the argument [--project] on the
     command line. This must be specified.

       VERSION
          ID of the version or fully qualified identifier for the version. This
          positional must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
          group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          Location of the version. Overrides the default artifacts/location
