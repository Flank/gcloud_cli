     provide the argument [--project] on the command line. This must be
     specified.

       TAG
          ID of the tag or fully qualified identifier for the tag. This
          positional must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
          group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          Location of the tag. Overrides the default artifacts/location
