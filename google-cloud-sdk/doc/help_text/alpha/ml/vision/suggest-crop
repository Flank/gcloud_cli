DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Returns the coordinates of a bounding box that surrounds the
    dominant object or face in an image.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     IMAGE_PATH
        The path to the image to be analyzed. This can be either a local path
        or a URL. If you provide a local file, the contents will be sent
        directly to Google Cloud Vision. If you provide a URL, it must be in
        Google Cloud Storage format (gs://bucket/object) or an HTTP URL
        (http://... or https://...)

FLAGS
     --aspect-ratios=[ASPECT_RATIOS,...]
        A list of aspect ratio hints for the suggested bounding box. Aspect
        ratios may be specified either as a decimal number (ex. 1.333) or as a
        ratio of width to height (ex 4:3).

     --model-version=MODEL_VERSION; default="builtin/stable"
        The model version to use for the feature. Supported values include
        "builtin/stable" and "builtin/latest".

    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
