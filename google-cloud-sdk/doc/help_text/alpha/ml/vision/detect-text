NAME
    gcloud alpha ml vision detect-text - detect and extract text within an
        image

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha ml vision detect-text IMAGE_PATH
        [--language-hints=[LANGUAGE_HINTS,...]]
        [--model-version=MODEL_VERSION; default="builtin/stable"]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Detect and extract text within an image.

    Google Cloud Vision uses OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to detect text
    within an image, with support for a broad array of languages and automatic
    label detection.

    Language hints can be provided to Google Cloud Vision API. In most cases,
    an empty value yields the best results since it enables automatic language
    detection. For languages based on the Latin alphabet, setting
    language_hints is not needed. Text detection returns an error if one or
    more of the specified languages is not one of the supported languages. (See
    https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/languages.) To provide language hints
    run:

        $ gcloud alpha ml vision detect-text --language-hints ja,ko

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     IMAGE_PATH
        The path to the image to be analyzed. This can be either a local path
        or a URL. If you provide a local file, the contents will be sent
        directly to Google Cloud Vision. If you provide a URL, it must be in
        Google Cloud Storage format (gs://bucket/object) or an HTTP URL
        (http://... or https://...)

FLAGS
     --language-hints=[LANGUAGE_HINTS,...]
        List of languages to use for text detection.

     --model-version=MODEL_VERSION; default="builtin/stable"
        The model version to use for the feature. Supported values include
        "builtin/stable" and "builtin/latest".
