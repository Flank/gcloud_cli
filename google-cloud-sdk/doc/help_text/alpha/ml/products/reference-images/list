DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) This command lists all Cloud Product Search ReferenceImages within
    a catalog.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Catalog resource - The catalog to list reference images for. This
     represents a Cloud resource. This must be specified.

       --catalog=CATALOG
          The ID of the catalog or a fully qualified identifier for the
          catalog.

FLAGS
     --product-id=PRODUCT_ID
        The product ID to list reference images for. Product Id is restricted
        to 255 characters including letters, numbers, underscore ( _ ) and
        hyphen (-).

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        The maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        A comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --uri
        Print a list of resource URIs instead of the default output.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To list all product search reference images for a catalog, run:

        $ gcloud alpha ml products reference-images list --catalog-id=101

    To list all product search reference images for a specific product in a
    catalog, run:

        $ gcloud alpha ml products reference-images list --catalog-id=101 \
            --product-id=my-product

    Note: For alpha, only catalogs with associated ReferenceImages will be
    displayed by the list command. Please be sure to note the catalog name at
    creation time so that it can be used by ml products catalogs
    reference-image commands.
