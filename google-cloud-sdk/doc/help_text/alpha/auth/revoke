NAME
    gcloud alpha auth revoke - revoke access credentials for an account

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha auth revoke [ACCOUNTS ...] [--all] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Revokes credentials for the specified user accounts or service
    accounts. When you revoke the credentials, they are removed from the local
    machine. If no account is specified, this command revokes credentials for
    the currently active account, effectively logging out of that account.

    You can revoke credentials when you want to disallow access by gcloud and
    other Cloud SDK tools using a specified account. You don't need to revoke
    credentials to switch between accounts.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     [ACCOUNTS ...]
        Accounts whose credentials are to be revoked.

FLAGS
     --all
        Revoke credentials for all accounts.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. Usually,
    users of ALPHA commands and flags need to apply for access, agree to
    applicable terms, and have their projects whitelisted. Contact Google or
    sign up on a product's page for ALPHA access. Product pages can be found at

        $ gcloud auth revoke
