NAME
    gcloud alpha auth revoke - revoke access credentials for an account

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha auth revoke [ACCOUNTS ...] [--all] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Revokes credentials for the specified user accounts or service
    accounts. When you revoke the credentials, they are removed from the local
    machine. If no account is specified, this command revokes credentials for
    the currently active account, effectively logging out of that account.

    You can revoke credentials when you want to disallow access by gcloud and
    other Cloud SDK tools using a specified account. You don't need to revoke
    credentials to switch between accounts.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     [ACCOUNTS ...]
        Accounts whose credentials are to be revoked.

FLAGS
     --all
        Revoke credentials for all accounts.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
    https://cloud.google.com/support/. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud auth revoke
        $ gcloud beta auth revoke
