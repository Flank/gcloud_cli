NAME
    gcloud alpha auth list - lists credentialed accounts

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha auth list [--filter-account=FILTER_ACCOUNT]
        [--filter=EXPRESSION] [--limit=LIMIT] [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE]
        [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Lists accounts whose credentials have been obtained using gcloud
    init, gcloud auth login and gcloud auth activate-service-account, and shows
    which account is active. The active account is used by gcloud and other
    Cloud SDK tools to access Google Cloud Platform. While there is no limit on
    the number of accounts with stored credentials, there is only one active
    account.

FLAGS
     --filter-account=FILTER_ACCOUNT
        List only credentials for one account. Use --filter="account~PATTERN"
        to select accounts that match PATTERN.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        The maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        A comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To set an existing account to be the current active account, run:

        $ gcloud config set core/account your-email-account@gmail.com

    If you don't have an existing account, create one using:

        $ gcloud init

    To list the active account name:

        $ gcloud auth list --filter=status:ACTIVE --format="value(account)"

    To list the inactive account names with prefix test:

        $ gcloud auth list --filter="-status:ACTIVE account:test*" \
            --format="value(account)"

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. Usually,
    users of ALPHA commands and flags need to apply for access, agree to
    applicable terms, and have their projects whitelisted. Contact Google or
    sign up on a product's page for ALPHA access. Product pages can be found at
