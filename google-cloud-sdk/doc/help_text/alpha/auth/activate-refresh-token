        refresh token

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha auth activate-refresh-token ACCOUNT [TOKEN]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Use an oauth2 refresh token to manufacture credentials for Google
    APIs. This token must have been acquired via some legitimate means to work.
    The account provided is only used locally to help the Cloud SDK keep track
    of the new credentials, so you can activate, list, and revoke the
    credentials in the future.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     ACCOUNT
        The account to associate with the refresh token.

     [TOKEN]
        OAuth2 refresh token. If blank, prompt for value.

    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.
