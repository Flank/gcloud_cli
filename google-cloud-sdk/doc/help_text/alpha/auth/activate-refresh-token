    gcloud alpha auth activate-refresh-token - get credentials via an existing
        refresh token

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha auth activate-refresh-token ACCOUNT [TOKEN]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Use an oauth2 refresh token to manufacture credentials for Google
    APIs. This token must have been acquired via some legitimate means to work.
    The account provided is only used locally to help the Cloud SDK keep track
    of the new credentials, so you can activate, list, and revoke the
    credentials in the future.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     ACCOUNT
        The account to associate with the refresh token.

     [TOKEN]
        OAuth2 refresh token. If blank, prompt for value.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is an internal implementation detail and may change or
    disappear without notice. This command is currently in ALPHA and may change
    without notice. If this command fails with API permission errors despite
    specifying the right project, you may be trying to access an API with an
    invitation-only early access allowlist.
