NAME
    gcloud alpha auth login - authorize gcloud to access the Cloud Platform
        with Google user credentials

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha auth login [ACCOUNT] [--no-activate] [--brief]
        [--enable-gdrive-access] [--force] [--no-launch-browser] [--update-adc]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Obtains access credentials for your user account via a web-based
    authorization flow. When this command completes successfully, it sets the
    active account in the current configuration to the account specified. If no
    configuration exists, it creates a configuration named default.

    If valid credentials for an account are already available from a prior
    authorization, the account is set to active without rerunning the flow.

    Use gcloud auth list to view credentialed accounts.

    If you'd rather authorize without a web browser but still interact with the
    command line, use the --no-launch-browser flag. To authorize without a web
    browser and non-interactively, create a service account with the
    appropriate scopes using the Google Cloud Platform Console
    (https://console.cloud.google.com) and use gcloud auth
    activate-service-account with the corresponding JSON key file.

    For more information on authorization and credential types, see:
    https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/authorizing.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     [ACCOUNT]
        User account used for authorization.

FLAGS
     --activate
        Set the new account to active. Enabled by default, use --no-activate to
        disable.

     --brief
        Minimal user output.

     --enable-gdrive-access
        Enable Google Drive access.

     --force
        Re-run the web authorization flow even if the given account has valid
        credentials.

     --launch-browser
        Launch a browser for authorization. If not enabled or if it is not
        possible to launch a browser, prints a URL to standard output to be
        copied. Enabled by default, use --no-launch-browser to disable.

     --update-adc
        Write the obtained credentials to the well-known location for
        Application Default Credentials (ADC). Run $ gcloud auth
        application-default --help to learn more about ADC. Any credentials
        previously generated by gcloud auth application-default login will be
        overwritten.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud auth login
        $ gcloud beta auth login
