NAME
    gcloud alpha auth activate-service-account - authorize gcloud to access
        Cloud Platform with a Google service account

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha auth activate-service-account [ACCOUNT] --key-file=KEY_FILE
        [--password-file=PASSWORD_FILE | --prompt-for-password]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) If you want gcloud (and other tools in the Cloud SDK) to use
    service account credentials to make requests, use this command to import
    these credentials from a file that contains a private authorization key,
    and activate them for use in gcloud. This command serves the same function
    as gcloud auth login but for using a service account rather than your
    Google user credentials.

    For more information on authorization and credential types, see:
    https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/authorizing.

    The key file for this command can be obtained using either:
      o the Cloud Platform console (https://console.cloud.google.com) or
      o $ gcloud iam service-accounts keys create.

    The key file can be .json (preferred) or .p12 (legacy) format. For legacy
    .p12 files, a separate password might be required. This password is
    displayed in the console when you create the key.

    The credentials will also be activated, which is same as running $ gcloud
    config set account ACCOUNT_NAME.

    If you specify a project using the --project flag, the project is set in
    your active configuration, which is same as running $ gcloud config set
    project PROJECT_NAME.

    Any previously active credentials will still be retained, and can be seen
    by running $ gcloud auth list. They will just no longer be the
    active/default credentials.

    If you want to delete previous credentials see gcloud auth revoke command.

    Note: Service accounts use client quotas for tracking usage.
