NAME
    gcloud alpha auth configure-docker - register gcloud as a Docker credential
        helper

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha auth configure-docker [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha auth configure-docker adds the Docker credHelper entry
    to Docker's configuration file, or creates the file if it doesn't exist.
    This will register gcloud as the credential helper for all Google-supported
    Docker registries. If the Docker configuration already contains a
    credHelper entry, it will be overwritten.

    Note, docker and gcloud need to be on the same system PATH to work
    correctly.

    For more details on Docker credential helpers, see
    https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/#credential-helpers.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access whitelist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud auth configure-docker
        $ gcloud beta auth configure-docker
