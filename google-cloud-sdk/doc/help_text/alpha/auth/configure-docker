NAME
    gcloud alpha auth configure-docker - registers gcloud as a Docker
        credential helper

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha auth configure-docker [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Adds Docker credHelper entry to Docker's configuration file, or
    creates the file if it doesn't exist, which will register gcloud as the
    credential helper for all Google supported Docker registries.

    If Docker configuration already contains a credHelper entry it will be
    overwritten.

    See
    https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/#credential-helpers
    for more details on Docker credential helpers.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. Usually,
    users of ALPHA commands and flags need to apply for access, agree to
    applicable terms, and have their projects whitelisted. Contact Google or
    sign up on a product's page for ALPHA access. Product pages can be found at

        $ gcloud beta auth configure-docker
