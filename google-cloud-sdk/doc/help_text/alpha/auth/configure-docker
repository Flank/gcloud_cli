NAME
    gcloud alpha auth configure-docker - register gcloud as a Docker credential
        helper

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha auth configure-docker [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha auth configure-docker adds the Docker credHelper entry
    to Docker's configuration file, or creates the file if it doesn't exist.
    This will register gcloud as the credential helper for all Google-supported
    Docker registries. If the Docker configuration already contains a
    credHelper entry, it will be overwritten.

    Note, docker and gcloud need to be on the same system PATH to work
    correctly.

    For more details on Docker credential helpers, see
    https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/#credential-helpers.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.
