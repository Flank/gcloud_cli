NAME
    gcloud alpha ml-engine versions - AI Platform Versions commands

SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) A version is an implementation of a model, represented as a
    serialized TensorFlow graph with trained parameters.

    When you communicate with AI Platform services, you use the combination of
    the model, version, and current project to identify a specific model
    implementation that is deployed in the cloud.

    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
