POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     JOB
        Name of the job.

FLAGS
     --summarize
        Summarize job output in a set of human readable tables instead of
        rendering the entire resource as json or yaml. The tables currently
        rendered are:

        * Job Overview: Overview of job including, jobId, status and create
          time.
        * Training Input Summary: Summary of input for a training job
          including region, main training python module and scale tier.
        * Training Output Summary: Summary of output for a training job
          including the amount of ML units consumed by the job.
        * Training Output Trials: Summary of hyperparameter trials run for a
          hyperparameter tuning training job.
        * Predict Input Summary: Summary of input for a prediction job
          including region, model verion and output path.
        * Predict Output Summary: Summary of output for a prediction job
          including prediction count and output path.

    This flag overrides the --format flag. If both are present on the command
    line, a warning is displayed.
