NAME
    gcloud alpha ml-engine local predict - run prediction locally

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha ml-engine local predict --model-dir=MODEL_DIR
        (--json-instances=JSON_INSTANCES | --text-instances=TEXT_INSTANCES)
        [--framework=FRAMEWORK] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha ml-engine local predict performs prediction locally
    with the given instances. It requires the TensorFlow SDK be installed
    locally. The output format mirrors gcloud ml-engine predict (online
    prediction)

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --model-dir=MODEL_DIR
        Path to the model.

     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --json-instances=JSON_INSTANCES
          Path to a local file from which instances are read. Instances are in
          JSON format; newline delimited.

          An example of the JSON instances file:

              {"images": [0.0, ..., 0.1], "key": 3}
              {"images": [0.0, ..., 0.1], "key": 2}
              ...

          This flag accepts "-" for stdin.

       --text-instances=TEXT_INSTANCES
          Path to a local file from which instances are read. Instances are in
          UTF-8 encoded text format; newline delimited.

          An example of the text instances file:

              107,4.9,2.5,4.5,1.7
              100,5.7,2.8,4.1,1.3
              ...

          This flag accepts "-" for stdin.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --framework=FRAMEWORK
        The ML framework used to train this version of the model. If not
        specified, defaults to tensorflow. FRAMEWORK must be one of:
        scikit-learn, tensorflow, xgboost.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. Usually,
    users of ALPHA commands and flags need to apply for access, agree to
    applicable terms, and have their projects whitelisted. Contact Google or
    sign up on a product's page for ALPHA access. Product pages can be found at
