NAME
    gcloud alpha ml-engine predict - run Cloud ML Engine online prediction

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha ml-engine predict --model=MODEL
        (--json-instances=JSON_INSTANCES | --text-instances=TEXT_INSTANCES)
        [--version=VERSION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha ml-engine predict sends a prediction request to Cloud
    ML Engine for the given instances. This command will read up to 100
    instances, though the service itself will accept instances up to the
    payload limit size (currently, 1.5MB). If you are predicting on more
    instances, you should use batch prediction via

        $ gcloud alpha ml-engine jobs submit prediction.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --model=MODEL
        Name of the model.

     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --json-instances=JSON_INSTANCES
          Path to a local file from which instances are read. Instances are in
          JSON format; newline delimited.

          An example of the JSON instances file:

              {"images": [0.0, ..., 0.1], "key": 3}
              {"images": [0.0, ..., 0.1], "key": 2}
              ...

          This flag accepts "-" for stdin.

       --text-instances=TEXT_INSTANCES
          Path to a local file from which instances are read. Instances are in
          UTF-8 encoded text format; newline delimited.

          An example of the text instances file:

              107,4.9,2.5,4.5,1.7
              100,5.7,2.8,4.1,1.3
              ...

          This flag accepts "-" for stdin.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --version=VERSION
        Model version to be used.

        If unspecified, the default version of the model will be used. To list
        model versions run

            $ gcloud alpha ml-engine versions list

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.
