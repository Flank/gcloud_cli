SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha ml-engine models get-iam-policy MODEL [--region=REGION]

        [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Gets the IAM policy for the given model.

    Returns an empty policy if the resource does not have a policy set.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Model resource - The AI Platform model to set IAM policy for. This
     represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the [project]
     attribute: provide the argument [model] on the command line with a fully
     specified name; provide the argument [--project] on the command line; set
     the property [core/project]. This must be specified.

       MODEL
          ID of the model or fully qualified identifier for the model.

FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        Google Cloud region of the regional endpoint to use for this command.
        If unspecified, the command uses the global endpoint of the AI Platform
        Training and Prediction API.

        Learn more about regional endpoints and see a list of available
        regions:
        https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/prediction/docs/regional-endpoints

        REGION must be one of: asia-east1, europe-west4, us-central1.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    The following command gets the IAM policy for the model my_model:

        $ gcloud alpha ml-engine models get-iam-policy my_model

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud ml-engine models get-iam-policy
        $ gcloud beta ml-engine models get-iam-policy
