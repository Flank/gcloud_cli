NAME
    gcloud alpha ml-engine models get-iam-policy - get the IAM policy for a
        model

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha ml-engine models get-iam-policy MODEL [--filter=EXPRESSION]
        [--limit=LIMIT] [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE] [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha ml-engine models get-iam-policy displays the IAM
    policy associated with a model. If formatted as JSON, the output can be
    edited and used as a policy file for set-iam-policy. The output includes an
    "etag" field identifying the version emitted and allowing detection of
    concurrent policy updates; see $ {parent} set-iam-policy for additional
    details.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Model resource - The model for which to display the IAM policy. This
     represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the [project]
     attribute: provide the flag [model] on the command line with a fully
     specified name; provide the flag [--project] on the command line; set the
     property [core/project]. This must be specified.

       MODEL
          The ID of the model or a fully qualified identifier for the model.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        The maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        A comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.
