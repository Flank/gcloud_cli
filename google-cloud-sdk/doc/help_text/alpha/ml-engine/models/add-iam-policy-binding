NAME
    gcloud alpha ml-engine models add-iam-policy-binding - add IAM policy
        binding for a model

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha ml-engine models add-iam-policy-binding MODEL --member=MEMBER
        --role=ROLE
        [--condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          | --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Adds a policy binding to the IAM policy of a ML engine model, given
    a model ID and the binding. One binding consists of a member, a role, and
    an optional condition.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     MODEL
        Name of the model.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --member=MEMBER
        The member to add the binding for. Should be of the form
        user|group|serviceAccount:email or domain:domain.

        Examples: user:test-user@gmail.com, group:admins@example.com,
        serviceAccount:test123@example.domain.com, or
        domain:example.domain.com.

        Can also be one of the following special values:
        * allUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone who is on the
          internet, with or without a Google account.
        * allAuthenticatedUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone
          who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account.

     --role=ROLE
        Define the role of the member.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     At most one of these may be specified:

       --condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          Condition of the binding to be added. When condition is explicitly
          specified as None (e.g. --condition=None), a binding without a
          condition is added. When --condition is specified and is not a None
          condition, --role cannot be a primitive role. Primitive roles are
          roles/editor, roles/owner, and roles/viewer.

       expression
          (Required) Expression of the condition which evaluates to True or
          False. This uses a subset of Common Expression Language syntax.

       title
          (Required) Title for the expression, i.e. a short string describing
          its purpose.

       description
          (Optional) Description for the expression. This is a longer text
          which describes the expression.

          NOTE: An unsatisfied condition will not allow access via this
          binding.

       --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE
          Path to a local JSON or YAML file that defines the condition. To see
          available fields, see the help for --condition.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,

EXAMPLES
    To add an IAM policy binding for the role of 'roles/ml.admin' for the user
    'test-user@gmail.com' on a model with identifier 'my_model', run:

        $ gcloud alpha ml-engine models add-iam-policy-binding my_model \
            --member='user:test-user@gmail.com' --role='roles/ml.admin'

    To add an IAM policy binding for the role of 'roles/ml.admin' to the
    service account 'test-proj1@example.domain.com', run:

        $ gcloud alpha ml-engine models add-iam-policy-binding my_model \
            --member='serviceAccount:test-proj1@example.domain.com' \
            --role='roles/ml.admin'

    To add an IAM policy binding for the role of 'roles/ml.admin' for all
    authenticated users on a model with identifier 'my_model', run:

        $ gcloud alpha ml-engine models add-iam-policy-binding my_model \
            --member='allAuthenticatedUsers' --role='roles/ml.admin'

    To add an IAM policy binding which expires at the end of the year 2018 for
    the role of 'roles/ml.admin' and the user 'test-user@gmail.com' on a model
    with identifier 'my_model', run:

        $ gcloud alpha ml-engine models add-iam-policy-binding my_model \
            --member='user:test-user@gmail.com' --role='roles/ml.admin' \
            --condition='expression=request.time <
         timestamp("2019-01-01T00:00:00Z"),title=expires_end_of_2018,descrip\
        tion=Expires at midnight on 2018-12-31'
