DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Creates a domain mapping.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     DOMAIN
        A valid domain which may begin with a wildcard, such as: example.com or
        .example.com

FLAGS
     --certificate-id=CERTIFICATE_ID
        A certificate id to use for this domain. May not be used on a domain
        mapping with automatically managed certificates. Use the gcloud app
        ssl-certificates list to see available certificates for this app.

     --certificate-management=CERTIFICATE_MANAGEMENT
        Type of certificate management. 'automatic' will provision an SSL
        certificate automatically while 'manual' requires the user to provide a
        certificate id to provision. CERTIFICATE_MANAGEMENT must be one of:
        automatic, manual.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To create a new App Engine new domain mapping with an automatically managed
    certificate, run:

        $ gcloud alpha app domain-mappings create 'example.com'

    To create a domain with a manual certificate, run:

        $ gcloud alpha app domain-mappings create '*.example.com'          \
                   --certificate-management=manual --certificate-id=1234

    Note: managed certificates do not support wildcard domain mappings.

    To create a domain with no associated certificate, run:

        $ gcloud alpha app domain-mappings create '*.example.com'          \
                   --certificate-management=manual
