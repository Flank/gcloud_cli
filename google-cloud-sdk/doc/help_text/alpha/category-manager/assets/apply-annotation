SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha category-manager assets apply-annotation ASSET
        (--annotation=ANNOTATION : --taxonomy=TAXONOMY) [--sub-asset=SUB_ASSET]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Apply an annotation to a given asset.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Asset resource - The asset reference. This represents a Cloud resource.
     This must be specified.

       ASSET
          ID of the asset or fully qualified identifier for the asset.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Annotation resource - An annotation reference. The arguments in this group
     can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some
     attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other
     ways. To set the [project] attribute: provide the argument [--annotation]
     on the command line with a fully specified name; provide the argument
     [--project] on the command line; set the property [core/project]. This
     must be specified.

       --annotation=ANNOTATION
          ID of the annotation or fully qualified identifier for the
          annotation. This flag must be specified if any of the other arguments
          in this group are specified.

       --taxonomy=TAXONOMY
          The ID of the taxonomy for the annotation.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --sub-asset=SUB_ASSET
        The name of the sub-asset to apply an annotation to. For instance, for
        Google Cloud Bigquery, this is the name of the column in the table
        (which is the asset).

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
