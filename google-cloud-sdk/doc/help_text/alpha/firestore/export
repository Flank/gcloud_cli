        Cloud Storage

SYNOPSIS

        [--collection-ids=[COLLECTION_IDS,...]] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) export Cloud Firestore documents to Google Cloud Storage

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     OUTPUT_URI_PREFIX
        Location where the export files will be stored. Must be a valid Google
        Cloud Storage bucket with an optional path prefix.

        For example:

            $ gcloud alpha firestore export gs://mybucket/my/path

        Will place the export in the mybucket bucket in objects prefixed with
        my/path.

FLAGS
     --async
        Display information about the operation in progress, without waiting
        for the operation to complete.

     --collection-ids=[COLLECTION_IDS,...]
        A list specifying which collections will be included in the operation.
        When omitted, all collections are included.

        For example, to operate on only the 'customers' and 'orders'
        collections:

            $ gcloud alpha firestore export --collection-ids='customers','orders'

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
    https://cloud.google.com/support/. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta firestore export
