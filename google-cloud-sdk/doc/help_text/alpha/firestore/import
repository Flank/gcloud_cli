NAME
    gcloud alpha firestore import - import Cloud Firestore documents from
        Google Cloud Storage

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha firestore import INPUT_URI_PREFIX [--async]
        [--collection-ids=[COLLECTION_IDS,...]] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) import Cloud Firestore documents from Google Cloud Storage

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INPUT_URI_PREFIX
        Location of the import files.

        This location is the 'output_uri_prefix' field of a previous export,
        and can be found via the 'gcloud alpha firestore operations describe'
        command.

FLAGS
     --async
        Display information about the operation in progress, without waiting
        for the operation to complete.

     --collection-ids=[COLLECTION_IDS,...]
        A list specifying which collections will be included in the operation.
        When omitted, all collections are included.

        For example, to operate on only the 'customers' and 'orders'
        collections:

            $ gcloud alpha firestore import --collection-ids='customers','orders'

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
    https://cloud.google.com/support/. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta firestore import
