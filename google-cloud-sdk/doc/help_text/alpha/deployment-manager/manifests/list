NAME
    gcloud alpha deployment-manager manifests list - list manifests in a
        deployment

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha deployment-manager manifests list --deployment=DEPLOYMENT
        [--simple-list] [--filter=EXPRESSION] [--limit=LIMIT]
        [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE] [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]] [--uri]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Prints a table with summary information on all manifests in the
    deployment.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --deployment=DEPLOYMENT
        Deployment name.

FLAGS
     --simple-list
        Changes the --format flag to print the resource IDs. Otherwise either
        the --format value or the default format is used.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --uri
        Print a list of resource URIs instead of the default output.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To print out a list of manifests in a deployment, run:

        $ gcloud alpha deployment-manager manifests list \
            --deployment my-deployment

    To print only the name of each manifest, run:

        $ gcloud alpha deployment-manager manifests list \
            --deployment my-deployment --simple-list

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
    https://cloud.google.com/support/. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud deployment-manager manifests list
        $ gcloud beta deployment-manager manifests list
