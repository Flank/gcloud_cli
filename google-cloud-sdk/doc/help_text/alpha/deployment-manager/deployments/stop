NAME
    gcloud alpha deployment-manager deployments stop - stop a pending or
        running deployment update or creation

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha deployment-manager deployments stop DEPLOYMENT_NAME [--async]
        [--fingerprint=FINGERPRINT] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) This command will stop a currently running or pending operation on
    a deployment.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     DEPLOYMENT_NAME
        Deployment name.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately and print information about the Operation in
        progress rather than waiting for the Operation to complete.
        (default=False)

     --fingerprint=FINGERPRINT
        The fingerprint to use in requests to modify a deployment. If not
        specified, a get deployment request will be made to fetch the latest
        fingerprint. A fingerprint is a randomly generated value that is part
        of the update, stop, and cancel-preview request to perform optimistic
        locking. It is initially generated by Deployment Manager and changes
        after every request to modify data. The latest fingerprint is printed
        when deployment data is modified.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To stop a running operation on a deployment, run:

        $ gcloud alpha deployment-manager deployments stop my-deployment

    To issue a stop command without waiting for the operation to complete, run:

        $ gcloud alpha deployment-manager deployments stop my-deployment \
            --async

    To stop a running operation on a deployment providing a fingerprint, run:

        $ gcloud alpha deployment-manager deployments stop my-deployment \
            --fingerprint deployment-fingerprint
