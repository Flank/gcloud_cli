DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) This command inserts (creates) a new deployment based on a provided
    config file.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     DEPLOYMENT_NAME
        Deployment name.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --composite-type=COMPOSITE_TYPE
          Name of a composite type to deploy.

       --config=CONFIG
          Filename of a top-level yaml config that specifies resources to
          deploy.

       --template=TEMPLATE
          Filename of a top-level jinja or python config template.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --create-policy=CREATE_POLICY; default="create-or-acquire"
        Create policy for resources that have changed in the update.
        CREATE_POLICY must be one of: acquire, create, create-or-acquire.

     --credential=CREDENTIAL
        Set the default credential that Deployment Manager uses to call
        underlying APIs of a deployment. Use PROJECT_DEFAULT to set deployment
        credential same as the credential of its owning project. Use
        serviceAccount:email to set default credential using provided service
        account.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Optional description of the deployment to insert.

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        A list of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     --preview
        Preview the requested create without actually instantiating the
        underlying resources. (default=False)

     --properties=[PROPERTIES,...]
        A comma separated, key:value, map to be used when deploying a template
        file or composite type directly.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --async
          Return immediately and print information about the Operation in
          progress rather than waiting for the Operation to complete.
          (default=False)

       --automatic-rollback-on-error
          If the create request results in a deployment with resource errors,
          delete that deployment immediately after creation. (default=False)

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To create a new deployment from a top-level yaml file, run:

        $ gcloud alpha deployment-manager deployments create my-deployment \
            --config config.yaml --description "My deployment"

    To create a new deployment from a top-level template file, run:

        $ gcloud deployment-manager deployments create my-deployment       \
                  --template template.{jinja|py}             \
            --properties "string-key:'string-value',integer-key:12345"

    To create a new deployment directly from a composite type, run:

        $ gcloud deployment-manager deployments create my-deployment       \
                  --composite-type <project-id>/composite:<type-name>      \
                   \
            --properties "string-key:'string-value',integer-key:12345"

    To preview a deployment without actually creating resources, run:

        $ gcloud alpha deployment-manager deployments create \
            my-new-deployment --config config.yaml --preview

    To instantiate a deployment that has been previewed, issue an update
    command for that deployment without specifying a config file.
