        Insight id which will be marked as accepted

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --etag=etag
        Etag of a insight

     Resource that is associated with cloud entity type. Currently four
     mutually exclusive flags are supported, --project, --billing-account,
     --folder, --organization. Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT
          The Google Cloud Platform Billing Account ID to use for this
          invocation.

       --folder=FOLDER_ID
          Folder ID to use for this invocation.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          The Google Cloud Platform Organization ID to use for this invocation.

       --project=PROJECT_ID
          The Google Cloud Platform Project Number to use for this invocation.

          The Google Cloud Platform project ID to use for this invocation. If
          omitted, then the current project is assumed; the current project can
          be listed using gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)' and
          can be set using gcloud config set project PROJECTID.

          --project and its fallback core/project property play two roles in
          the invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate
          on. It also specifies the project for API enablement check, quota,
          and billing. To specify a different project for quota and billing,
          use --billing-project or billing/quota_project property.

OPTIONAL FLAGS

        Insight Type of the insights

     --location=LOCATION
        Location

     --state-metadata=KEY=VALUE,[KEY=VALUE,...]

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud recommender insights mark-accepted
        $ gcloud beta recommender insights mark-accepted
