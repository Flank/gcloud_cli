NAME
    gcloud alpha recommender recommendations mark-claimed - mark a
        recommendation's state as CLAIMED

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha recommender recommendations mark-claimed
        (RECOMMENDATION : --location=LOCATION --recommender=RECOMMENDER)
        --etag=ETAG [--state-metadata=KEY=VALUE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Mark a recommendation's state as CLAIMED. Can be applied to
    recommendations in CLAIMED, SUCCEEDED, FAILED, or ACTIVE state. Users can
    use this method to indicate to the Recommender API that they are starting
    to apply the recommendation themselves. This stops the recommendation
    content from being updated.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Recommendation resource - The Cloud Recommendation to mark as claimed. The
     arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways. To set the [project] attribute: provide the
     argument [recommendation] on the command line with a fully specified name;
     provide the argument [--project] on the command line; set the property
     [core/project]. This must be specified.

       RECOMMENDATION
          ID of the recommendation or fully qualified identifier for the
          recommendation. This positional must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location ID.

       --recommender=RECOMMENDER
          The recommender ID.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --etag=ETAG
        The fingerprint of the recommendation.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --state-metadata=KEY=VALUE
        A comma-separated list of key-value pairs to include in request. This
        fully replaces the current state_metadata for this recommendation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

        $ gcloud recommender recommendations mark-claimed
        $ gcloud beta recommender recommendations mark-claimed
