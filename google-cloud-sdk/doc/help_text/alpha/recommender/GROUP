NAME
    gcloud alpha recommender - manage Cloud recommendations and recommendation
        rules

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha recommender GROUP [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Recommender allows you to retrieve recommendations for Cloud
    resources, helping you to improve security, save costs, and more. Each
    recommendation includes a suggested action, its justification, and its
    impact. Recommendations are grouped into a per-resource collection. To
    apply a recommendation, you must use the desired service's API, not the
    Recommender. Interact with and manage resources in Cloud Recommender.

    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.
