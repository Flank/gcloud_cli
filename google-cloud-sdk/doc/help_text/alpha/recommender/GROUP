NAME
    gcloud alpha recommender - manage Cloud recommendations and recommendation
        rules

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha recommender GROUP [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Recommender allows you to retrieve recommendations for Cloud
    resources, helping you to improve security, save costs, and more. Each
    recommendation includes a suggested action, its justification, and its
    impact. Recommendations are grouped into a per-resource collection. To
    apply a recommendation, you must use the desired service's API, not the
    Recommender. Interact with and manage resources in Cloud Recommender.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

GROUPS
    GROUP is one of the following:

     insights
        (ALPHA) Manage insights for Cloud recommendations.

     recommendations
        (ALPHA) Manage Cloud resource recommendations.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access whitelist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta recommender
