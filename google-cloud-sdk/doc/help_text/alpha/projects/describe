NAME
    gcloud alpha projects describe - show metadata for a project

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha projects describe PROJECT_ID [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Shows metadata for a project given a valid project ID.

    This command can fail for the following reasons:
      o The project specified does not exist.
      o The active account does not have permission to access the given
        project.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     PROJECT_ID
        ID for the project you want to describe.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

EXAMPLES
    The following command prints metadata for a project with the ID
    example-foo-bar-1:

        $ gcloud alpha projects describe example-foo-bar-1

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access whitelist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud projects describe
        $ gcloud beta projects describe
