NAME
    gcloud alpha projects update - update the name and/or labels of a project

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha projects update PROJECT_ID
        (--name=NAME --update-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...] --clear-labels
          | --remove-labels=[KEY,...]) [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Update the name and/or labels of the given project.

    This command can fail for the following reasons:
      o There is no project with the given ID.
      o The active account does not have Owner or Editor permissions for the
        given project.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     PROJECT_ID
        ID for the project you want to update.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     At least one of these must be specified:

       --name=NAME
          New name for the project.

       Labels Flags

         --update-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
            A list of label KEY=VALUE pairs to update. If a label exists its
            value is modified, otherwise a new label is created.

         At most one of these may be specified:

           --clear-labels
              Removes all labels. If --update-labels is also specified then
              --clear-labels is applied first.

              For example, to remove all labels:

                  $ gcloud alpha projects update --clear-labels

              To set the labels to exactly "foo" and "baz":

                  $ gcloud alpha projects update --clear-labels \
                    --update-labels foo=bar,baz=qux

           --remove-labels=[KEY,...]
              A list of label keys to remove. If a label does not exist it is
              silently ignored.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    The following command updates a project with the ID example-foo-bar-1 to
    have the name "Foo Bar & Grill" and removes the label dive:

        $ gcloud alpha projects update example-foo-bar-1 \
            --name="Foo Bar & Grill" --remove-labels=dive

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. Usually,
    users of ALPHA commands and flags need to apply for access, agree to
    applicable terms, and have their projects whitelisted. Contact Google or
    sign up on a product's page for ALPHA access. Product pages can be found at
