DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Removes an IAM policy binding from a Cloud Healthcare API DICOM
    store.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     DicomStore resource - Cloud Healthcare API DICOM store to remove an IAM
     policy binding from. The arguments in this group can be used to specify
     the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the [project]
     attribute: provide the argument [dicom_store] on the command line with a
     fully specified name; provide the argument [--project] on the command
     line; set the property [core/project]. This must be specified.

       DICOM_STORE
          ID of the dicomStore or fully qualified identifier for the
          dicomStore. This positional must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --dataset=DATASET
          Cloud Healthcare dataset.

       --location=LOCATION
          Google Cloud location.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --member=MEMBER
        The member to remove the binding for. Should be of the form
        user|group|serviceAccount:email or domain:domain.

        Examples: user:test-user@gmail.com, group:admins@example.com,
        serviceAccount:test123@example.domain.com, or
        domain:example.domain.com.

        Can also be one of the following special values:
        * allUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone who is on the
          internet, with or without a Google account.
        * allAuthenticatedUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone
          who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account.

     --role=ROLE
        The role to remove the member from.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     At most one of these may be specified:

       --all
          Remove all bindings with this role and member, irrespective of any
          conditions.

       --condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          Condition of the binding to be removed. When condition is explicitly
          specified as None (e.g. --condition=None), it matches a binding
          without a condition. Otherwise, only the binding with a condition
          which exactly matches the specified condition (including the optional
          description) will be removed.

       expression
          (Required) Expression of the condition which evaluates to True or
          False. This uses a subset of Common Expression Language syntax.

       title
          (Required) Title for the expression, i.e. a short string describing
          its purpose.

       description
          (Optional) Description for the expression. This is a longer text
          which describes the expression.

          NOTE: An unsatisfied condition will not allow access via this
          binding.

       --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE
          Path to a local JSON or YAML file that defines the condition. To see
          available fields, see the help for --condition.

    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,

    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access whitelist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud healthcare dicom-stores remove-iam-policy-binding
        $ gcloud beta healthcare dicom-stores remove-iam-policy-binding
