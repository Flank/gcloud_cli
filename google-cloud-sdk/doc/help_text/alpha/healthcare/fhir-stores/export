NAME
    gcloud alpha healthcare fhir-stores export - export Cloud Healthcare API
        FHIR resources

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha healthcare fhir-stores export
        (FHIR_STORE : --dataset=DATASET --location=LOCATION) [--async]
        [--gcs-uri=GCS_URI | [--bq-dataset=BQ_DATASET
          : --recursive-depth=RECURSIVE_DEPTH --schema-type=SCHEMA_TYPE]]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Export Cloud Healthcare API FHIR resources.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     FhirStore resource - Cloud Healthcare API FHIR store to export resources
     from. The arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of
     this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this
     group but can be set in other ways. To set the [project] attribute:
     provide the argument [fhir_store] on the command line with a fully
     specified name; provide the argument [--project] on the command line; set
     the property [core/project]. This must be specified.

       FHIR_STORE
          ID of the fhirStore or fully qualified identifier for the fhirStore.
          This positional must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --dataset=DATASET
          Cloud Healthcare dataset.

       --location=LOCATION
          Google Cloud location.

FLAGS
     --async
        Display information about the operation in progress, without waiting
        for the operation to complete.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --gcs-uri=GCS_URI
          The Cloud Storage destination location. Specify a path to a Cloud
          Storage bucket or folder rather than a concrete object. The exported
          outputs are organized by FHIR resource types. The server will create
          one object per resource type. Each object contains newline delimited
          JSON, and each line is a FHIR resource.

       --bq-dataset=BQ_DATASET
          BigQuery dataset that houses the BigQuery tables. This flag must be
          specified if any of the other arguments in this group are specified.

       --recursive-depth=RECURSIVE_DEPTH
          The depth for all recursive structures in the output analytics
          schema. For example, concept in the CodeSystem resource is a
          recursive structure; when the depth is 2, the CodeSystem table will
          have a column called concept.concept but not concept.concept.concept.
          If not specified or set to 0, the server will use the default value
          2.

       --schema-type=SCHEMA_TYPE
          Specifies the output schema type. If unspecified, the default is
          LOSSLESS. SCHEMA_TYPE must be one of:

           analytics
              Analytics schema defined by the FHIR community. See
              https://github.com/rbrush/sql-on-fhir/blob/master/sql-on-fhir.md.

           lossless
              Schema generated from original FHIR data.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
