        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Creates a Cloud Healthcare API FHIR store.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     FhirStore resource - Cloud Healthcare API FHIR store to create. The
     arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways. To set the [project] attribute: provide the
     argument [fhir_store] on the command line with a fully specified name;
     provide the argument [--project] on the command line; set the property
     [core/project]. This must be specified.

       FHIR_STORE
          ID of the fhirStore or fully qualified identifier for the fhirStore.
          This positional must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --dataset=DATASET
          Cloud Healthcare dataset.

       --location=LOCATION
          Google Cloud location.

FLAGS
     --disable-referential-integrity
        Whether to disable referential integrity in this FHIR store. Default
        value is false, meaning that the API will enforce referential integrity
        and fail the requests that will result in inconsistent state in the
        FHIR store. When this field is set to true, the API will skip
        referential integrity check. This field is immutable after store
        creation.

     --disable-resource-versioning
        Whether to disable resource versioning for this FHIR store. If set to
        false, which is the default behavior, all write operations will cause
        historical versions to be recorded automatically. Historical versions
        can be fetched through the history APIs, but cannot be updated. This
        field is immutable after store creation.

     --enable-update-create
        Whether this FHIR store has the [updateCreate]
        (https://www.hl7.org/fhir/capabilitystatement-definitions.html#CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.updateCreate)
        capability. Determines if the client can use an Update operation to
        create a new resource with a client-specified ID. If false, all IDs are
        server-assigned through the Create operation and attempts to Update a
        non-existent resource will return errors.

     --pubsub-topic=PUBSUB_TOPIC
        Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic to send updates to.

        Note, a topic needs to be created before publishing or subscribing to
        it. For instructions on creating topics, refer to:
        https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/admin#create_a_topic
