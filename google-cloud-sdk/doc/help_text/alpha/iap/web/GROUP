SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha iap web COMMAND [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Cloud Identity-Aware Proxy (Cloud IAP) controls access to your
    cloud applications running on Google Cloud Platform. Cloud IAP works by
    verifying user identity and context of the request to determine if a user
    should be allowed to access the application.

    More information on Cloud IAP can be found here:
    https://cloud.google.com/iap and detailed documentation can be found here:
