SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Cloud Identity-Aware Proxy (Cloud IAP) controls access to your
    cloud applications running on Google Cloud Platform. Cloud IAP works by
    verifying user identity and context of the request to determine if a user
    should be allowed to access the application.

    More information on Cloud IAP can be found here:
    https://cloud.google.com/iap and detailed documentation can be found here:
    https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/

    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

    access whitelist. This variant is also available:
