NAME
    gcloud alpha services disable - disable a service for consumption for a
        project

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha services disable [SERVICE ...] [--async] [--force]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) This command disables one or more previously-enabled services for
    consumption.

    To see a list of the enabled services for a project, run:

        $ gcloud alpha services list

    More information on listing services can be found at:
    https://cloud.google.com/service-usage/docs/list-services and on disabling
    a service at: https://cloud.google.com/service-usage/docs/enable-disable

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     [SERVICE ...]
        The name of the service(s) to disable.

FLAGS
     --async
        Display information about the operation in progress, without waiting
        for the operation to complete.

     --force
        If specified, the disable call will proceed even if there are enabled
        services which depend on the service to be disabled. Forcing the call
        means that the services which depend on the service to be disabled will
        also be disabled.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To disable a service called my-consumed-service for the active project,
    run:

        $ gcloud alpha services disable my-consumed-service

    To run the same command asynchronously (non-blocking), run:

        $ gcloud alpha services disable my-consumed-service --async

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
    https://cloud.google.com/support/. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud services disable
        $ gcloud beta services disable
