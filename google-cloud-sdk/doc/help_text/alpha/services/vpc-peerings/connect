    10.197.0.0/20,10.198.0.0/20 for the service to use, run:

        $ gcloud alpha services vpc-peerings connect --network my-network \
            --service your-service \
            --reserved-ranges 10.197.0.0/20,10.198.0.0/20

    To run the same command asynchronously (non-blocking), run:

        $ gcloud alpha services vpc-peerings connect --network my-network \
            --service your-service \
            --reserved-ranges 10.197.0.0/20,10.198.0.0/20 --async

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
    https://cloud.google.com/support/. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta services vpc-peerings connect
