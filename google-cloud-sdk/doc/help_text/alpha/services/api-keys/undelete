NAME
    gcloud alpha services api-keys undelete - undelete an API key

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha services api-keys undelete KEY [--async]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) API Keys that are deleted will be retained in the system for 30
    days. If a key is still within this retention window, it can be undeleted
    with this command.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Key resource - The name of the key to undelete. This represents a Cloud
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways. To set the [project] attribute: provide the
     argument [key] on the command line with a fully specified name; provide
     the argument [--project] on the command line; set the property
     [core/project]. This must be specified.

       KEY
          ID of the key or fully qualified identifier for the key.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access whitelist.
