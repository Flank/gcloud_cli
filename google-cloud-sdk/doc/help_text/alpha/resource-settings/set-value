NAME
    gcloud alpha resource-settings set-value - update the value of a resource
        setting

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha resource-settings set-value SETTING_NAME
        --value-file=value-file
        (--folder=FOLDER_ID | --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          | --project=PROJECT_ID) [--etag=etag] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Update the value of a resource setting

    This first converts the contents of the specified file into a setting
    object. It then fetches the current setting using GetSetting. If it does
    not exist, the setting is created using CreateSetting. If it does, the
    retrieved setting is checked to see if it needs to be updated. If so, the
    setting is updated using UpdateSetting.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     SETTING_NAME
        Name of the resource settings. The list of available settings can be
        found here:

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --value-file=value-file
        Path to JSON or YAML file that contains the resource setting.

     Resource that is associated with the resource settings. Exactly one of
     these must be specified:

       --folder=FOLDER_ID
          Folder ID.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          Organization ID.

       --project=PROJECT_ID
          Project ID. Overrides the default core/project property value for
          this command invocation.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --etag=etag
        Etag of the resource setting.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,

NOTES

    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
