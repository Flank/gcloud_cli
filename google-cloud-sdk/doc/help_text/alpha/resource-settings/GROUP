NAME
    gcloud alpha resource-settings - create and manage Resource Settings

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha resource-settings COMMAND [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) The gcloud Resource Settings command group lets you create and
    manipulate Resource Settings.

    The Resource Settings Service is a hierarchy-aware service with a
    public-facing API for end-users to store settings that modify the behavior
    of their Google Cloud Platform resources (e.g., VM, firewall, Project,
    etc.). The settings are attached at the project level and above and can
    influence CRM resources as well as sub-project resources that are
    descendants of the setting attachment point.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
