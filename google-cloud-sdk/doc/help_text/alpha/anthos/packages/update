NAME
    gcloud alpha anthos packages update - update a local package with changes
        from a remote source repo

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha anthos packages update LOCAL_DIR[@GIT_REF] [--dry-run]
        [--repo-uri=REPO_URI] [--strategy=STRATEGY] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Update a local package with changes from a remote source repo.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     LOCAL_DIR[@GIT_REF]
        The local package directory to update. Can optionally include a git
        reference (GIT_REF) to a tag, branch or commit hash to update to.
        Defaults to last fetched git-ref.

FLAGS
     --dry-run
        If true and command fails print the underlying command that was
        executed and its exit status.

     --repo-uri=REPO_URI
        git repo url for updating contents. Defaults to the url the package was
        fetched from.

     --strategy=STRATEGY
        Controls how changes to the local package are handled. STRATEGY must be
        one of:

         alpha-git-patch
            use 'git format-patch' and 'git am' to apply a patch of the changes
            between the source version and destination version. Requires the
            local package to have been committed to a local git repo.
         fast-forward
            fail without updating if the local package was modified since it
            was fetched.
         force-delete-replace
            This will wipe all local changes to the package. Deletes the
            contents of local package from PACKAGE_DIR and replace them with
            the remote
         resource-merge
            perform a structural comparison of the original/updated Resources,
            and merge the changes into the local package.
