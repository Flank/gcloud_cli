NAME
    gcloud alpha redis operations describe - show metadata for a Memorystore
        Redis operation

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha redis operations describe (OPERATION : --region=REGION)
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Display all metadata associated with a Redis operation given a
    valid operation name.

    This command can fail for the following reasons:
      o The operation specified does not exist.
      o The active account does not have permission to access the given
        operation.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Operation resource - Arguments and flags that specify the Memorystore
     Redis operation you want to describe. The arguments in this group can be
     used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes
     are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set
     the [project] attribute: provide the flag [operation] on the command line
     with a fully specified name; provide the flag [--project] on the command
     line; set the property [core/project]. This must be specified.

       OPERATION
          The ID of the operation or a fully qualified identifier for the
          operation. This positional must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --region=REGION
          The name of the Redis region of the operation. Overrides the default
          redis/region property value for this command invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the redis/v1alpha1 API. The full documentation for this
    API can be found at: https://cloud.google.com/memorystore/docs/redis/

EXAMPLES
    The following command prints metadata for an operation with the name in
    your default region:

        $ gcloud alpha redis operations describe \
            operation-1484002552235-425b144f8c3f8-81aa4b49-0830d1e9

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
    https://cloud.google.com/support/. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta redis operations describe
