NAME
    gcloud alpha storage list - list the objects in Cloud Storage buckets

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha storage list [PATH ...] [--flatten-results] [--recursive]
        [--filter=EXPRESSION] [--limit=LIMIT] [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE]
        [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]] [--uri] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha storage list lets you list the objects in your Cloud
    Storage buckets. Forward slashes in object names are logically treated as
    directories for the purposes of listing contents. See below for example of
    how to use wildcards to get the listing behavior you want.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     [PATH ...]
        The path of objects and directories to list. The path must begin with
        gs:// and may or may not contain wildcard characters.

FLAGS
     --flatten-results
        Show all matching objects in one list as opposed to grouping by
        directory.

     --recursive
        Recursively list the contents of any directories that match the path
        expression.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --uri
        Print a list of resource URIs instead of the default output.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To list the contents of a bucket:

        $ gcloud alpha storage list gs://my-bucket

    This will list the direct contents of the bucket. To recursively list the
    contents of all directories in the bucket:

        $ gcloud alpha storage list gs://my-bucket --recursive

    You can use wildcards to match multiple paths (including multiple buckets).
    Bucket wildcards are expanded only to the buckets contained in your current
    project:

        $ gcloud alpha storage list gs://my-b*/log*.txt

    The following wildcards are valid and match only within the current
    directory:

        *: Matches zero or more characters
        ?: Matches zero or one characters
        []: Matches a character range (ex. [a-z] or [0-9])

    You can use double-star wildcards to match zero or more directory levels in
    a path:

        $ gcloud alpha storage list gs://my-bucket/**/log*.txt

    You can also use double-star to match all files after a root in a path:

        $ gcloud alpha storage list gs://my-bucket/**

    Double-star expansion can not be combined with other expressions in a given
    path segment and will operate as a single star in that context. For
    example:

        gs://my-bucket/dir**/log.txt      is treated as:

        gs://my-bucket/dir*/log.txt       and instead should be written as:

        gs://my-bucket/dir*/**/log.txt    to get the recursive behavior.

NOTES
    This command is an internal implementation detail and may change or
    disappear without notice. This command is currently in ALPHA and may change
    without notice. If this command fails with API permission errors despite
    specifying the right project, you may be trying to access an API with an
    invitation-only early access allowlist.
