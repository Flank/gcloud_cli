NAME
    gcloud alpha storage ls - list the objects in Cloud Storage buckets

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha storage ls [PATH ...] [--recursive, -R, -r]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha storage ls lets you list the objects in your Cloud
    Storage buckets. Forward slashes in object names are logically treated as
    directories for the purposes of listing contents. See below for example of
    how to use wildcards to get the listing behavior you want.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     [PATH ...]
        The path of objects and directories to list. The path must begin with
        gs:// and may or may not contain wildcard characters.

FLAGS
     --recursive, -R, -r
        Recursively list the contents of any directories that match the path
        expression.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To list the buckets in current project:

        $ gcloud alpha storage ls

    To list the contents of a bucket:

        $ gcloud alpha storage ls gs://my-bucket

    You can use wildcards to match multiple paths (including multiple buckets).
    Bucket wildcards are expanded only to the buckets contained in your current
    project:

        $ gcloud alpha storage ls gs://my-b*/log*.txt

    The following wildcards are valid and match only within the current
    directory:

        *: Matches zero or more characters
        ?: Matches zero or one characters
        []: Matches a character range (ex. [a-z] or [0-9])

    You can use double-star wildcards to match zero or more directory levels in
    a path:

        $ gcloud alpha storage ls gs://my-bucket/**/log*.txt

    You can also use double-star to match all files after a root in a path:

        $ gcloud alpha storage ls gs://my-bucket/**

    Double-star expansion can not be combined with other expressions in a given
    path segment and will operate as a single star in that context. For
    example:

        gs://my-bucket/dir**/log.txt      is treated as:

        gs://my-bucket/dir*/log.txt       and instead should be written as:

        gs://my-bucket/dir*/**/log.txt    to get the recursive behavior.

    List all items recursively with formatting by using -r:

        $ gcloud alpha storage ls ls -r gs://bucket

    Recursive listings are similar to ** except with line breaks and header
    formatting for each container.

NOTES
    This command is an internal implementation detail and may change or
    disappear without notice. This command is currently in ALPHA and may change
    without notice. If this command fails with API permission errors despite
    specifying the right project, you may be trying to access an API with an
    invitation-only early access allowlist.
