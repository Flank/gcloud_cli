NAME
    gcloud alpha storage delete - delete Cloud Storage objects and buckets

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha storage delete PATH [PATH ...] [--recursive]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha storage delete lets you delete Cloud Storage objects
    and buckets. You can specify one or more paths (including wildcards) and
    all matching objects and buckets will be deleted.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     PATH [PATH ...]
        The path of objects and directories to delete. The path must begin with
        gs:// and may or may not contain wildcard characters.

FLAGS
     --recursive
        Recursively delete the contents of any directories that match the path
        expression.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To delete an object, run:

        $ *gcloud alpha storage delete* gs://mybucket/a.txt

    To delete all objects in a directory, run:

        $ *gcloud alpha storage delete* gs://mybucket/remote-dir/*

    The above command will delete all objects under remote-dir/ but not its
    sub-directories.

    To delete a directory and all its objects and subdirectories, run:

        $ *gcloud alpha storage delete* --recursive gs://mybucket/remote-dir
        $ *gcloud alpha storage delete* gs://mybucket/remote-dir/**

    To delete all objects and subdirectories of a directory, without deleting
    the directory itself, run:

        $ *gcloud alpha storage delete* \
            --recursive gs://mybucket/remote-dir/*

        or

        $ *gcloud alpha storage delete* gs://mybucket/remote-dir/**

    To delete all objects and directories in a bucket without deleting the
    bucket itself, run:

        $ *gcloud alpha storage delete* gs://mybucket/**

    To delete all text files in a bucket or a directory, run:

        $ *gcloud alpha storage delete* gs://mybucket/*.txt
        $ *gcloud alpha storage delete* gs://mybucket/remote-dir/*.txt

    To go beyond directory boundary and delete all text files in a bucket or a
    directory, run:

        $ *gcloud alpha storage delete* gs://mybucket/**/*.txt
        $ *gcloud alpha storage delete* gs://mybucket/remote-dir/**/*.txt

    To delete a bucket, run:

        $ *gcloud alpha storage delete* gs://mybucket

    You can use wildcards in bucket names. To delete all buckets with prefix of
    my, run:

        $ *gcloud alpha storage delete* --recursive gs://my*
