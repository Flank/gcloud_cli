EXAMPLES
    Uploading files:

        To upload a single file to a remote location:

        $ *gcloud alpha storage copy* path/to/file.txt gs://mybucket/file.txt
        $ *gcloud alpha storage copy* path/to/file.txt gs://mybucket/

        The above two commands both create gs://mybucket/file.txt.

        To upload multiple files to a remote location:

        $ *gcloud alpha storage copy* path/to/a.txt other/path/b.txt \
          gs://mybucket/remote-dir/

        The above command will create gs://mybucket/remote-dir/a.txt and
        gs://mybucket/remote-dir/b.txt. If remote-dir does not exist, this command will create
        remote-dir.

        To upload a directory my-dir and all its sub-directories and files:

        $ *gcloud alpha storage copy* --recursive my-dir \
          gs://mybucket/remote-dir/

        If my-dir has a subdirectory sub-dir and sub-dir has a file a.txt, the above
        command will create gs://mybucket/remote-dir/my-dir/sub-dir/a.txt. The structure of directory
        is kept.

        The following command also uploads all files in my-dir and sub-directories recursively:

        $ *gcloud alpha storage copy* my-dir/** gs://mybucket/remote-dir/

        The above command flattens the directory strucutre and creates gs://mybucket/remote-dir/a.txt.

        To upload all files in a directory, ignoring the subdirectories:

        $ *gcloud alpha storage copy*  my-dir/* gs://mybucket/remote-dir/

        If my-dir has a file a.txt and a subdirectory sub-dir. The above command will ceate
        gs://mybucket/remote-dir/a.txt.

        We can combine the wildcards to upload all text files in a directory and all subdirectories
        recursively:

        $ *gcloud alpha storage copy*  my-dir/**/*.txt \
          gs://mybucket/remote-dir/

    Downloading files:

        To download a single file:

        $ *gcloud alpha storage copy* gs://mybucket/file.txt local-dir/
        $ *gcloud alpha storage copy* gs://mybucket/file.txt \
          local-dir/file.txt

        The above two commands both create local-dir/file.txt.

        To download multiple files:

        $ *gcloud alpha storage copy* gs://mybucket/a.txt \
          gs://mybucket/b.txt local-dir/

        The above command creates local-dir/a.txt and local-dir/b.txt.

        To download a directory and all its sub-directories and files:

        $ *gcloud alpha storage copy* \
          --recursive gs://mybucket/remote-dir/ local-dir/

        The above command creates local-dir/remote-dir/ which contains all files and subdirectories
        of gs://mybucket/remote-dir/. The structure of directory is kept.

        The following command also downloads all files in gs://mybucket/remote-dir/ to local-dir:

        $ *gcloud alpha storage copy* gs://mybucket/remote-dir/** local-dir/

        If remote-dir contains files a.txt and sub-dir/b.txt, the above command flattens the
        directory structure and creates local-dir/a.txt and local-dir/b.txt.

        To download all files, ignoring the subdirectories::

        $ *gcloud alpha storage copy* gs://mybucket/remote-dir/* local-dir/

        We can combine the wildcards to download all text files under remote-dir and its
        subdirectories:

        $ *gcloud alpha storage copy* gs://mybucket/remote-dir/**/*.txt \
          local-dir/

    Coping between Cloud Storage locations:

        To copy a single file to another location:

        $ *gcloud alpha storage copy* gs://mybucket/file.txt \
          gs://otherbucket/file.txt
        $ *gcloud alpha storage copy* gs://mybucket/file.txt \
          gs://otherbucket/

        The above two commands both create gs://otherbucket/file.txt.

        To copy multiple files to a new location:

        $ *gcloud alpha storage copy* gs://mybucket/a.txt \
          gs://mybucket/b.txt gs://otherbucket/target-dir/

        The above command creates gs://otherbucket/target-dir/a.txt and
        gs://otherbucket/target-dir/b.txt. If target-dir does not exist, this command will create
        target-dir.

        To copy all files and subdirectories in one location to another:

        $ *gcloud alpha storage copy* \
          --recursive gs://mybucket/source-dir/ \
          gs://otherbucket/target-dir/

        If source-dir has a subdirectory sub-dir and sub-dir has a file a.txt, the above
        command will create gs://mybucket/target-dir/source-dir/sub-dir/a.txt. The structure of
        directory is kept.

        The following command also copies all files in source-dir and its sub-directories:

        $ *gcloud alpha storage copy* gs://mybucket/source-dir/** \
          gs://mybucket/target-dir/

        The above command flattens the directory strucutre and creates gs://mybucket/target-dir/a.txt.

        To copy all files in a directory, ignoring the subdirectories:

        $ *gcloud alpha storage copy* gs://mybucket/source-dir/* \
          gs://mybucket/target-dir/

        If source-dir has a file a.txt and a subdirectory sub-dir. The above command will ceate
        gs://mybucket/target-dir/a.txt.

        We can combine the wildcards to copy all text in one location and all its sub-directories:

        $ *gcloud alpha storage copy* gs://mybucket/source-dir/**/*.txt \
          gs://mybucket/target-dir/
