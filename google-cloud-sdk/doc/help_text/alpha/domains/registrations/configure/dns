DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Configure DNS settings of a Cloud Domains registration.

    In most cases, this command is used for changing the authoritative name
    servers for the given domain. However, advanced options are available.

    This command can only be called on registrations in state ACTIVE or
    SUSPENDED.

    When using Cloud DNS Zone or Google Domains name servers the DNS Security
    (DNSSEC) will be enabled by default (if possible). It can be disabled using
    --disable-dnssec flag.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Registration resource - The domain registration to configure DNS settings
     for. This represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not
     given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the
     [project] attribute: provide the argument [registration] on the command
     line with a fully specified name; provide the argument [--project] on the
     command line; set the property [core/project]. To set the [location]
     attribute: provide the argument [registration] on the command line with a
     fully specified name; location is always global. This must be specified.

       REGISTRATION
          ID of the registration or fully qualified identifier for the
          registration.

COMMONLY USED FLAGS
     --validate-only
        Don't actually configure DNS settings of the registration. Only
        validate arguments.

     Set the addresses of authoritative name servers for the given domain. At
     most one of these may be specified:

       --cloud-dns-zone=CLOUD_DNS_ZONE
          The name of the Cloud DNS managed-zone to set as the name server for
          the domain. If it's in the same project, you can use short name. If
          not, use the full resource name, e.g.:
          --cloud-dns-zone=projects/example-project/managedZones/example-zone.
          DNS Security (DNSSEC) is turned on by default (if possible).

       --dns-settings-from-file=DNS_SETTINGS_FROM_FILE
          A YAML file containing the required DNS settings. If specified, its
          content will replace the values currently used in the registration
          resource. It means, that if the file is missing some of the
          dns_settings field, they will be cleared.

          Examples of file contents:

              googleDomainsDns:
                dsState: DS_RECORDS_PUBLISHED
              glueRecords:
              - hostName: ns1.example.com
                ipv4Addresses:
                - 8.8.8.8
              - hostName: ns2.example.com
                ipv4Addresses:
                - 8.8.8.8

              customDns:
                nameServers:
                - new.ns1.com
                - new.ns2.com
                dsRecords:
                - keyTag: 24
                  algorithm: RSASHA1
                  digestType: SHA256
                  digest: 2e1cfa82b035c26cbbbdae632cea070514eb8b773f616aaeaf668e2f0be8f10d
                - keyTag: 42
                  algorithm: RSASHA1
                  digestType: SHA256
                  digest: 2e1cfa82bf35c26cbbbdae632cea070514eb8b773f616aaeaf668e2f0be8f10d

          Warning: Do not change name servers if ds_records is non-empty. Clear
          ds_records first and wait 24 hours before changing name servers.
          Otherwise your domain may stop serving.

       --name-servers=NAME_SERVER,...,[...]
          List of DNS name servers for the domain.

       --use-google-domains-dns
          Use free name servers provided by Google Domains. DNS Security
          (DNSSEC) is turned on by default.

OTHER FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --disable-dnssec
        When using Cloud DNS Zone or Google Domains nameservers the DNS
        Security (DNSSEC) will be enabled for the domain (unless the zone is
        not signed). Use this flag to disable DNSSEC.

     --unsafe-dns-update
        Use this flag to allow DNS changes that may make your domain stop
        serving.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To start an interactive flow to configure DNS settings for example.com,
    run:

        $ gcloud alpha domains registrations configure dns example.com

    To use Cloud DNS managed-zone example-zone for example.com, run:

        $ gcloud alpha domains registrations configure dns example.com \
            --cloud-dns-zone=example-zone

    If the managed-zone is signed, DNSSEC will be enabled for the domain.

    To change DNS settings for example.com according to information from a YAML
    file dns_settings.yaml, run:

        $ gcloud alpha domains registrations configure dns example.com \
            --dns-settings-from-file=dns_settings.yaml

    To disable DNS Security (DNSSEC), run:

        $ gcloud alpha domains registrations configure dns example.com \
            --disable-dnssec

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access whitelist.
