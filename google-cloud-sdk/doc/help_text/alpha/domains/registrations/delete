     provide the argument [registration] on the command line with a fully
     specified name; provide the argument [--project] on the command line; set
     the property [core/project]. To set the [location] attribute: provide the
     argument [registration] on the command line with a fully specified name;
     location is always global. This must be specified.

       REGISTRATION
          ID of the registration or fully qualified identifier for the
          registration.

FLAGS

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta domains registrations delete
