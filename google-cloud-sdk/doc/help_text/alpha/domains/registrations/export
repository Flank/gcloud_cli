NAME
    gcloud alpha domains registrations export - export a Cloud Domains
        registration

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha domains registrations export REGISTRATION [--async]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Export the domain to direct management by Google Domains. The
    domain remains valid until expiry.

    After you export a registered domain, the auto-renewal will be disabled,
    but you will continue to incur billing charges until the next yearly
    renewal date. You will also become the sole owner of the domain in Google
    Domains, and Cloud IAM is not used anymore.

    To manage your domain after exporting, visit Google Domains at
    https://domains.google.com/registrar, or see
    https://support.google.com/domains/answer/3251174 for more information.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Registration resource - The domain registration to export. This represents
     a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this
     group but can be set in other ways. To set the [project] attribute:
     provide the argument [registration] on the command line with a fully
     specified name; provide the argument [--project] on the command line; set
     the property [core/project]. To set the [location] attribute: provide the
     argument [registration] on the command line with a fully specified name;
     location is always global. This must be specified.
