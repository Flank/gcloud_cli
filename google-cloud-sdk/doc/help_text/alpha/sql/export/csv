NAME
    gcloud alpha sql export csv - exports data from a Cloud SQL instance to a
        CSV file

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha sql export csv INSTANCE URI --query=QUERY [--async]
        [--database=DATABASE,[DATABASE,...], -d DATABASE,[DATABASE,...]]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Exports data from a Cloud SQL instance to a Google Cloud Storage
    bucket as a plain text file with one line per row and comma-separated
    fields.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE
        Cloud SQL instance ID.

     URI
        The path to the file in Google Cloud Storage where the export will be
        stored. The URI is in the form gs://bucketName/fileName. If the file
        already exists, the operation fails. If the filename ends with .gz, the
        contents are compressed.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --query=QUERY
        A SQL SELECT query (e.g., SELECT * FROM table) that specifies the data
        to export.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Display information about the operation in progress, without waiting
        for the operation to complete.

     --database=DATABASE,[DATABASE,...], -d DATABASE,[DATABASE,...]
        Database (for example, guestbook) from which the export is made. If
        unspecified, all databases are exported.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
    https://cloud.google.com/support/. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud sql export csv
