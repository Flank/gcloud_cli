        ID for the folder you want to update.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access whitelist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud resource-manager folders update
        $ gcloud beta resource-manager folders update
