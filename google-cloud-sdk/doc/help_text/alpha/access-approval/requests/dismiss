NAME
    gcloud alpha access-approval requests dismiss - dismiss an Access Approval
        request

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha access-approval requests dismiss NAME [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Dismiss an Access Approval request. Note: this does not deny access
    to the resource if another request has been made and approved for the same
    resource. This will raise an error if the request does not exist.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        approval request name

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To dismiss an approval request using its name (e.g.
    projects/12345/approvalRequests/abc123), run:

        $ gcloud alpha access-approval requests dismiss \
            projects/12345/approvalRequests/abc123

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access whitelist.
