SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha access-approval settings update
        [--enrolled_services=ENROLLED_SERVICES]

        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Update the Access Approval settings associated with a project, a
    folder, or organization. Partial updates are supported (for example, you
    can update the notification emails without modifying the enrolled
    services).

FLAGS
     --enrolled_services=ENROLLED_SERVICES
        Comma-separated list of services to enroll for Access Approval or 'all'
        for all supported services. Note for project and folder enrollments,
        only 'all' is supported. Use '' to clear all enrolled services.

     --notification_emails=NOTIFICATION_EMAILS
        Comma-separated list of email addresses to which notifications relating
        to approval requests should be sent or '' to clear all saved
        notification emails.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --folder=FOLDER
          folder number. only one of --project, --folder, or --organization can
          be provided. If none are provided then it uses config property
          [core/project].

       --organization=ORGANIZATION
          organization number. either --project, --folder, or --organization
          must be provided. If none are provided then it uses config property
          [core/project].

       --project=PROJECT
          project number or id. only one of --project, --folder, or
          --organization can be provided. If none are provided then it uses
          config property [core/project].

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    Update notification emails associated with project 'p1', run:

        $ gcloud alpha access-approval settings update --project=p1 \
          --notification_emails='foo@example.com, bar@example.com'

    Enable Access Approval enforcement for folder 'f1':

        $ gcloud alpha access-approval settings update --folder=f1 \
          --enrolled_services=all

    Enable Access Approval enforcement for organization 'org1' for only Cloud
    Storage and Compute products and set the notification emails at the same
    time:

        $ gcloud alpha access-approval settings update --organization=org1 \
          --enrolled_services='storage.googleapis.com,compute.googleapis.c\
        om' --notification_emails='security_team@example.com'

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access whitelist.
