        Compute Engine node template

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute sole-tenancy node-templates create NAME
        (--node-requirements=[localSSD=LOCALSSD],[memory=MEMORY],[vCPU=VCPU]
          | --node-type=NODE_TYPE) [--description=DESCRIPTION]
        [--node-affinity-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]] [--region=REGION]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Creates a Google Compute Engine node template.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the node templates to operate on.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --node-requirements=[localSSD=LOCALSSD],[memory=MEMORY],[vCPU=VCPU]
          The requirements for nodes. Google Compute Engine will automatically
          choose a node type that fits the requirements on Node Group creation.
          If multiple node types match your defined criteria, the NodeType with
          the least amount of each resource will be selected. You can specify
          'any' to indicate no preference for a certain resource.

          The following keys are allowed:

           vCPU
              The number of committed cores available to the node.

           memory
              The amount of memory available to the node. This value should
              include unit (eg. 3072MB or 9GB). If no units are specified, MB
              is assumed.

           localSSD
              Optional. The amount of SSD space available on the node. This
              value should include unit (eg. 3072MB or 9GB). If no units are
              specified, GB is assumed.

       --node-type=NODE_TYPE
          The node type to use for nodes in node groups using this template.
          The type of a node determines what resources are available to
          instances running on the node.

          See the following for more information:

              $ gcloud alpha compute sole-tenancy node-types

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional description of this resource.

     --node-affinity-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        Labels to use for node affinity, which will be used in instance
        scheduling. This corresponds to the --node-affinity flag on compute
        instances create and compute instance-templates create.

     --region=REGION
        The region of the node templates to operate on. If not specified, you
        may be prompted to select a region.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is an internal implementation detail and may change or
    disappear without notice. This command is currently in ALPHA and may change
    without notice. Usually, users of ALPHA commands and flags need to apply
    for access, agree to applicable terms, and have their projects whitelisted.
