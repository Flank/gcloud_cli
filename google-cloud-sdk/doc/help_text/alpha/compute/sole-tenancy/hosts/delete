NAME
    gcloud alpha compute sole-tenancy hosts delete - delete Google Compute
        Engine sole-tenancy hosts

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute sole-tenancy hosts delete NAME [NAME ...]
        [--zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute sole-tenancy hosts delete deletes one or more
    Google Compute Engine sole-tenancy hosts. Hosts can be deleted only if they
    are not being used by any virtual machine instances.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME [NAME ...]
        The names of the hosts to delete.

FLAGS
     --zone=ZONE
        The zone of the hosts to delete. If not specified and the compute/zone
        property isn't set, you will be prompted to select a zone.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.
