NAME
    gcloud alpha compute sole-tenancy node-groups update - updates a Google
        Compute Engine node group

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute sole-tenancy node-groups update NAME
        [--node-template=NODE_TEMPLATE] [--zone=ZONE]
        [--add-nodes=ADD_NODES | --delete-nodes=[NODE_INDEX,...]]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Updates a Google Compute Engine node group.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the node group to operate on.

FLAGS
     --node-template=NODE_TEMPLATE
        The name of the node template resource to be set for this node group.

     --zone=ZONE
        The zone of the node group to operate on. If not specified and the
        compute/zone property isn't set, you may be prompted to select a zone.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --add-nodes=ADD_NODES
          The number of nodes to add to the node group.

       --delete-nodes=[NODE_INDEX,...]
          The indexes of the nodes to remove from the group.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.
