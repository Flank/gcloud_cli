NAME
    gcloud alpha compute sole-tenancy node-groups add-iam-policy-binding - add
        IAM policy binding to a Compute Engine node group

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute sole-tenancy node-groups add-iam-policy-binding
        (NODE_GROUP : --zone=ZONE) --member=MEMBER --role=ROLE
        [--condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          | --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Add an IAM policy binding to the IAM policy of a Compute Engine
    node group. One binding consists of a member, a role, and an optional
    condition.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Node group resource - The node group for which to add IAM policy binding
     to. The arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of
     this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this
     group but can be set in other ways. To set the [project] attribute:
     provide the argument [node_group] on the command line with a fully
     specified name; set the property [core/project]; provide the argument
     [--project] on the command line. This must be specified.

       NODE_GROUP
          ID of the node_group or fully qualified identifier for the
          node_group. This positional must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --zone=ZONE
          The name of the Google Compute Engine zone.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --member=MEMBER
        The member to add the binding for. Should be of the form
        user|group|serviceAccount:email or domain:domain.

        Examples: user:test-user@gmail.com, group:admins@example.com,
        serviceAccount:test123@example.domain.com, or
        domain:example.domain.com.

        Can also be one of the following special values:
        * allUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone who is on the
          internet, with or without a Google account.
        * allAuthenticatedUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone
          who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account.

     --role=ROLE
        Define the role of the member.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     At most one of these may be specified:

       --condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          The condition of the binding to be added. When the condition is
          explicitly specified as None (--condition=None), a binding without a
          condition is added. When the condition is specified and is not None,
          --role cannot be a primitive role. Primitive roles are roles/editor,
          roles/owner, and roles/viewer.

       expression
          (Required) Expression of the condition which evaluates to True or
          False. This uses a subset of Common Expression Language syntax.

       title
          (Required) A short string describing the purpose of the expression.

       description
          (Optional) Additional description for the expression.

          NOTE: An unsatisfied condition will not allow access via this
          binding.

       --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE
          Path to a local JSON or YAML file that defines the condition. To see
          available fields, see the help for --condition.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the compute/alpha API. The full documentation for this
    API can be found at:
    https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/reference/latest/

EXAMPLES
    To add an IAM policy binding for the role of 'roles/compute.admin' for the
    user 'test-user@gmail.com' with node group 'my-node-group' and zone 'ZONE',
    run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute sole-tenancy node-groups \
            add-iam-policy-binding my-node-group --zone=ZONE \
            --member='user:test-user@gmail.com' --role='roles/compute.admin'

    To add an IAM policy binding which expires at the end of the year 2018 for
    the role of 'roles/compute.admin' and the user 'test-user@gmail.com' with
    node group 'my-node-group' and zone 'ZONE', run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute sole-tenancy node-groups \
            add-iam-policy-binding my-node-group --zone=ZONE \
            --member='user:test-user@gmail.com' \
            --role='roles/compute.admin' \
            --condition='expression=request.time <
         timestamp("2019-01-01T00:00:00Z"),title=expires_end_of_2018,descrip\
        tion=Expires at midnight on 2018-12-31'

    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:
