NAME
    gcloud alpha compute start-iap-tunnel - starts an IAP TCP forwarding tunnel

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute start-iap-tunnel INSTANCE_NAME INSTANCE_PORT
        [--local-host-port=LOCAL_HOST_PORT; default="localhost:0"]
        [--zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Starts a tunnel to the Cloud Identity-Aware Proxy through which
    another process can create a connection (eg. SSH, RDP) to a Google Compute
    Engine instance.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAME
        Name of the instance to operate on. For details on valid instance
        names, refer to the criteria documented under the field 'name' at:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances

     INSTANCE_PORT
        The name or number of the instance's port to connect to.

FLAGS
     --local-host-port=LOCAL_HOST_PORT; default="localhost:0"
        Host:port to which the proxy should be bound.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the instance to operate on. If not specified, the user may be
        prompted to select a zone. gcloud will attempt to identify the zone by
        searching for resources in the user's project. If the zone cannot be
        determined, the user will then be prompted with all Google Cloud
        Platform zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, the user can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To open a tunnel to the instances's RDP port on an arbitrary local port,
    run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute start-iap-tunnel my-instance 3389

    To open a tunnel to the instance's RDP port on a specific local port, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute start-iap-tunnel my-instance 3389 \
            --local-host-port=localhost:3333

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access whitelist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute start-iap-tunnel
        $ gcloud beta compute start-iap-tunnel
