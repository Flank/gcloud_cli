        [--global | --region=REGION | --zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute operations describe displays all data
    associated with a Google Compute Engine operation in a project.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        The name of the operation to describe.

FLAGS
     --user-accounts
        If provided, it is assumed that the requested operation is a Compute

        and --zone flags.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --global
          If provided, it is assumed the operation is global.

       --region=REGION
          The region of the operation to describe. Overrides the default
          compute/region property value for this command invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          The zone of the operation to describe. Overrides the default
          compute/zone property value for this command invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To get details about a global operation, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute operations describe OPERATION --global

    To get details about a regional operation, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute operations describe OPERATION \
            --region us-central1

    To get details about a zonal operation, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute operations describe OPERATION \
            --zone us-central1-a

    To get details about a Compute User Accounts operation, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute operations describe OPERATION --user-accounts
