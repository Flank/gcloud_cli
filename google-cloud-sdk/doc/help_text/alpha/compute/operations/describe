NAME
    gcloud alpha compute operations describe - describe a Google Compute Engine
        operation

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute operations describe NAME
        [--global | --region=REGION | --zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute operations describe displays all data
    associated with a Google Compute Engine operation in a project.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the operation to describe.

FLAGS
     At most one of these may be specified:

       --global
          If set, the operation is global.

       --region=REGION
          Region of the operation to describe. Overrides the default
          compute/region property value for this command invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the operation to describe. Overrides the default compute/zone
          property value for this command invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

EXAMPLES
    To get details about a global operation, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute operations describe OPERATION --global

    To get details about a regional operation, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute operations describe OPERATION \
            --region us-central1

    To get details about a zonal operation, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute operations describe OPERATION \
            --zone us-central1-a

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access whitelist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute operations describe
        $ gcloud beta compute operations describe
