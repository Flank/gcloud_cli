DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Create Google Compute Engine commitments.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     COMMITMENT
        Name of the commitment to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --plan=PLAN
        Duration of the commitment. PLAN must be one of: 12-month, 36-month.

     --resources=[RESOURCE=COMMITMENT,...]
        Resources to be included in the commitment commitment:
        * MEMORY should include unit (eg. 3072MB or 9GB). If no units are
          specified, GB is assumed.
        * VCPU is number of committed cores.
    Ratio between number of VCPU cores and memory must conform to limits
    described on:
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/creating-instance-with-custom-machine-type

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        Region of the commitment to create. If not specified, you may be
        prompted to select a region.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     --type=TYPE; default="general-purpose"
        Type of commitment. memory-optimized indicates that the commitment is
        for memory-optimized VMs. TYPE must be one of: general-purpose,
        memory-optimized.

     Manage the allocations to be created with the commitment. At most one of
     these may be specified:

       --allocations-from-file=ALLOCATIONS_FROM_FILE
          The path to a YAML file of multiple allocations' configuration.

       Manage the allocation to be created with the commitment.

         --allocation=ALLOCATION
            Name of the zonal allocation to operate on. This flag must be
            specified if any of the other arguments in this group are
            specified.

         --allocation-zone=ALLOCATION_ZONE
            Zone of the zonal allocation to operate on. If not specified and
            the compute/zone property isn't set, you may be prompted to select
            a zone.

            To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
            compute/zone property:

                $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

            A list of zones can be fetched by running:

                $ gcloud compute zones list

            To unset the property, run:

                $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

            Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
            CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

         Manage the specific SKU allocation properties to create.

           --accelerator=[count=COUNT],[type=TYPE]
              Manage the configuration of the type and number of accelerator
              cards attached.

       count
          The number of pieces of the accelerator to attach to the allocation.

       type
          The specific type (e.g. nvidia-tesla-k80 for nVidia Tesla K80) of
          accelerator to attach to the allocation. Use 'gcloud compute
          accelerator-types list' to learn about all available accelerator
          types.

               --local-ssd=[interface=INTERFACE],[size=SIZE]
                  Manage the size and the interface of local SSD to use.

       interface
          The kind of disk interface exposed to the VM for this SSD. Valid
          values are scsi and nvme. SCSI is the default and is supported by
          more guest operating systems. NVME may provide higher performance.

       size
          The size of the local SSD in base-2 GB.
               --machine-type=MACHINE_TYPE
                  The type of machine (name only) which has fixed number of
                  vCPUs and fixed amount of memory. This also includes
                  specifying custom machine type following
                  custom-NUMBER_OF_CPUS-AMOUNT_OF_MEMORY pattern.

               --min-cpu-platform=MIN_CPU_PLATFORM
                  The minimum cpu platform of the allocation.

               --require-specific-allocation
                  Indicates whether the allocation can be consumed by VMs with
                  "any allocation" defined. If enabled, then only VMs that
                  target the allocation by name using --allocation-affinity can
                  consume this allocation. It also indicates that if true, the
                  existing instances are also accounted in the allocation.

               --vm-count=VM_COUNT
                  The number of resources that are allocated to this
                  allocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
    https://cloud.google.com/support/. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute commitments create
        $ gcloud beta compute commitments create
