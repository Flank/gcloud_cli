NAME
    gcloud alpha compute commitments create - create Google Compute Engine
        commitments

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute commitments create COMMITMENT --plan=PLAN
        --resources=[RESOURCE=COMMITMENT,...] [--region=REGION]
        [--type=TYPE; default="general-purpose"] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Create Google Compute Engine commitments.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     COMMITMENT
        Name of the commitment to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --plan=PLAN
        Duration of the commitment. PLAN must be one of: 12-month, 36-month.

     --resources=[RESOURCE=COMMITMENT,...]
        Resources to be included in the commitment commitment:
        * MEMORY should include unit (eg. 3072MB or 9GB). If no units are
          specified, GB is assumed.
        * VCPU is number of committed cores.
    Ratio between number of VCPU cores and memory must conform to limits
    described on:
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/creating-instance-with-custom-machine-type

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        Region of the commitment to create. If not specified, you may be
        prompted to select a region.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     --type=TYPE; default="general-purpose"
        Type of commitment. memory-optimized indicates that the commitment is
        for memory-optimized VMs. TYPE must be one of: general-purpose,
        memory-optimized.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
    https://cloud.google.com/support/. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute commitments create
        $ gcloud beta compute commitments create
