DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Create Google Compute Engine commitments.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     COMMITMENT
        Name of the commitment to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --plan=PLAN
        Duration of the commitment. PLAN must be one of: 12-month, 36-month.

     Manage the commitment for particular resources. At least one of these must
     be specified:

       --resources=[local-ssd=LOCAL-SSD],[memory=MEMORY],[vcpu=VCPU]
          Resources to be included in the commitment. The ratio between the
          number of vCPU cores and memory must conform to limits described at:
          https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/creating-instance-with-custom-machine-type#specifications.
       memory
          The size of the memory, should include units (e.g. 3072MB or 9GB). If
          no units are specified, GB is assumed.
       vcpu
          The number of the vCPU cores.
       local-ssd
          The size of local SSD.
       --resources-accelerator=[count=COUNT],[type=TYPE]
          Manage the configuration of the type and number of accelerator cards
          to include in the commitment.
       count
          The number of accelerators to include.
       type
          The specific type (e.g. nvidia-tesla-k80 for NVIDIA Tesla K80) of the
          accelerator. Use gcloud compute accelerator-types list to learn about
          all available accelerator types.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        Region of the commitment to create. If not specified, you may be
        prompted to select a region.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     --type=TYPE; default="general-purpose"
        Type of commitment. memory-optimized indicates that the commitment is
        for memory-optimized VMs. TYPE must be one of: compute-optimized,
        general-purpose, general-purpose-e2, general-purpose-n2,
        general-purpose-n2d, memory-optimized.

     Manage the reservations to be created with the commitment. At most one of
     these may be specified:

       --reservations-from-file=RESERVATIONS_FROM_FILE
          Path to a YAML file of multiple reservations' configuration.

       Manage the reservation to be created with the commitment.

         --reservation=RESERVATION
            Name of the reservation to operate on. This flag must be specified
            if any of the other arguments in this group are specified.

         --reservation-zone=RESERVATION_ZONE
            Zone of the reservation to operate on. If not specified and the
            compute/zone property isn't set, you may be prompted to select a
            zone.

            To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
            compute/zone property:

                $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

            A list of zones can be fetched by running:

                $ gcloud compute zones list

            To unset the property, run:

                $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

            Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
            CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

         Manage the specific SKU reservation properties to create.

           --accelerator=[count=COUNT],[type=TYPE]
              Manage the configuration of the type and number of accelerator
              cards attached.
       count
          The number of accelerators to attach to each instance in the
          reservation.
       type
          The specific type (e.g. nvidia-tesla-k80 for nVidia Tesla K80) of
          accelerator to attach to instances in the reservation. Use gcloud
          compute accelerator-types list to learn about all available
          accelerator types.

               --local-ssd=[interface=INTERFACE],[size=SIZE]
                  Manage the size and the interface of local SSD to use. See
                  https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/local-ssd for
                  more information.
       interface
          The kind of disk interface exposed to the VM for this SSD. Valid
          values are scsi and nvme. SCSI is the default and is supported by
          more guest operating systems. NVME may provide higher performance.
       size
          The size of the local SSD in base-2 GB.
               --machine-type=MACHINE_TYPE
                  The type of machine (name only) which has a fixed number of
                  vCPUs and a fixed amount of memory. This also includes
                  specifying custom machine type following
                  custom-number_of_CPUs-amount_of_memory pattern, e.g.
                  custom-32-29440.

               --min-cpu-platform=MIN_CPU_PLATFORM
                  Optional minimum CPU platform of the reservation to create.

               --require-specific-reservation
                  Indicates whether the reservation can be consumed by VMs with
                  "any reservation" defined. If enabled, then only VMs that
                  target this reservation by name using
                  --reservation-affinity=specific can consume from this
                  reservation.

               --vm-count=VM_COUNT
                  The number of VM instances that are allocated to this
                  reservation. The value of this field must be an int in the
                  range [1, 1000].

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access whitelist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute commitments create
        $ gcloud beta compute commitments create
