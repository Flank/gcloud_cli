          | [--reservation=RESERVATION : --reservation-zone=RESERVATION_ZONE

        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Update the resource shape of reservations within the commitment.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     COMMITMENT
        Name of the commitment to update reservation.

FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        Region of the commitment to update reservation. If not specified, you
        may be prompted to select a region.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     Manage the reservations to be created with the commitment. At most one of
     these may be specified:

       --reservations-from-file=RESERVATIONS_FROM_FILE
          Path to a YAML file of multiple reservations' configuration.

       Manage the reservation to be created with the commitment.

         --reservation=RESERVATION
            Name of the reservation to operate on. This flag must be specified
            if any of the other arguments in this group are specified.

         --reservation-zone=RESERVATION_ZONE
            Zone of the reservation to operate on. If not specified and the
            compute/zone property isn't set, you may be prompted to select a
            zone.

            To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
            compute/zone property:

                $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

            A list of zones can be fetched by running:

                $ gcloud compute zones list

            To unset the property, run:

                $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

            Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
            CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

         Manage the specific SKU reservation properties to create.

           --accelerator=[count=COUNT],[type=TYPE]
              Manage the configuration of the type and number of accelerator
              cards attached.
       count
          The number of accelerators to attach to each instance in the
          reservation.
       type
          The specific type (e.g. nvidia-tesla-k80 for nVidia Tesla K80) of
          accelerator to attach to instances in the reservation. Use gcloud
          compute accelerator-types list to learn about all available
          accelerator types.

               --local-ssd=[interface=INTERFACE],[size=SIZE]
                  Manage the size and the interface of local SSD to use. See
                  https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/local-ssd for
                  more information.
       interface
          The kind of disk interface exposed to the VM for this SSD. Valid
          values are scsi and nvme. SCSI is the default and is supported by
          more guest operating systems. NVME may provide higher performance.
       size
          The size of the local SSD in base-2 GB.
               --machine-type=MACHINE_TYPE
                  The type of machine (name only) which has a fixed number of
                  vCPUs and a fixed amount of memory. This also includes
                  specifying custom machine type following
                  custom-number_of_CPUs-amount_of_memory pattern, e.g.
                  custom-32-29440.

               --min-cpu-platform=MIN_CPU_PLATFORM
                  Optional minimum CPU platform of the reservation to create.

               --require-specific-reservation
                  Indicates whether the reservation can be consumed by VMs with
                  "any reservation" defined. If enabled, then only VMs that
                  target this reservation by name using
                  --reservation-affinity=specific can consume from this
                  reservation.

               --vm-count=VM_COUNT
                  The number of VM instances that are allocated to this
                  reservation. The value of this field must be an int in the
                  range [1, 1000].

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
    https://cloud.google.com/support/. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta compute commitments update-reservations
