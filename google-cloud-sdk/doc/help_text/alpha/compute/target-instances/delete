NAME
    gcloud alpha compute target-instances delete - delete target instances

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute target-instances delete NAME [NAME ...] [--zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute target-instances delete deletes one or more
    Google Compute Engine target instances. Target instances can be deleted
    only if they are not being used by any other resources like forwarding
    rules.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME [NAME ...]
        Names of the target instances to delete.

FLAGS
     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the target instances to delete. If not specified and the
        compute/zone property isn't set, you may be prompted to select a zone.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
    https://cloud.google.com/support/. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute target-instances delete
        $ gcloud beta compute target-instances delete
