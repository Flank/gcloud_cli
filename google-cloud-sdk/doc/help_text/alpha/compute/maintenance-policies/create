NAME
    gcloud alpha compute maintenance-policies create - create a Google Compute
        Engine Maintenance Policy

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute maintenance-policies create NAME
        --start-time=START_TIME [--description=DESCRIPTION] [--region=REGION]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute maintenance-policies create creates a
    Maintenance Policy which specifies what kind of maintenance operations may
    be performed and when they can be performed.

    Currently Maintenance Policies are only available for instances and only
    support 1-day cycles.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        The name of the maintenance policy to operate on.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --start-time=START_TIME
        Start time of a four-hour window in which maintenance activity should
        start in given cadence. Valid choices are 00:00, 04:00, 08:00,12:00,
        16:00 and 20:00 UTC. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on
        time formats. For example, --start-time="03:00-05" (which gets
        converted to 08:00 UTC).

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Description of the maintenance policy.

     --region=REGION
        The region of the maintenance policy to operate on. If not specified,
        you will be prompted to select a region.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. Usually,
    users of ALPHA commands and flags need to apply for access, agree to
    applicable terms, and have their projects whitelisted. Contact Google or
