NAME
    gcloud alpha compute images describe-from-family - describe the latest
        image from an image family

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute images describe-from-family IMAGE_NAME
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute images describe-from-family looks up the
    latest image from an image family and runs a describe on it. If the image
    is not in the default project, you need to specify a value for --project.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     IMAGE_NAME
        Name of the disk image to describe.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To view the description for the latest debian-9 image from the debian-cloud
    project, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute images describe-from-family debian-9 \
            --project=debian-cloud

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute images describe-from-family
        $ gcloud beta compute images describe-from-family
