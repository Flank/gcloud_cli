NAME
    gcloud alpha compute images get-iam-policy - get the IAM policy for a
        Google Compute Engine image

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute images get-iam-policy IMAGE [--filter=EXPRESSION]
        [--limit=LIMIT] [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE] [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute images get-iam-policy displays the IAM policy
    associated with a Google Compute Engine image in a project. If formatted as
    JSON, the output can be edited and used as a policy file for
    set-iam-policy. The output includes an "etag" field identifying the version
    emitted and allowing detection of concurrent policy updates; see $ {parent}
    set-iam-policy for additional details.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Image resource - The image for which to display the IAM policy. This
     represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the [project]
     attribute: Set the property [core/project] or provide the flag [--project]
     on the command line. This must be specified.

       IMAGE
          The ID of the image or a fully qualified identifier for the image.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        The maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        A comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.
