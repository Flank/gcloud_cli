NAME
    gcloud alpha compute images deprecate - manage deprecation status of
        Compute Engine images

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute images deprecate IMAGE_NAME --state=STATE
        [--replacement=REPLACEMENT]
        [--delete-in=DELETE_IN | --delete-on=DELETE_ON]
        [--deprecate-in=DEPRECATE_IN | --deprecate-on=DEPRECATE_ON]
        [--obsolete-in=OBSOLETE_IN | --obsolete-on=OBSOLETE_ON]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute images deprecate is used to deprecate images.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     IMAGE_NAME
        Name of the disk image to operate on.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --state=STATE
        The deprecation state to set on the image. STATE must be one of:

         ACTIVE
            The image is currently supported.
         DELETED
            New uses result in an error. Setting this state will not
            automatically delete the image. You must still make a request to
            delete the image to remove it from the image list.
         DEPRECATED
            Operations which create a new DEPRECATED resource return
            successfully, but with a warning indicating that the image is
            deprecated and recommending its replacement.
         OBSOLETE
            New uses result in an error.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --replacement=REPLACEMENT
        Specifies a Compute Engine image as a replacement for the image being
        phased out. Users of the deprecated image will be advised to switch to
        this replacement. For example, --replacement example-image or
        --replacement projects/google/global/images/example-image.

        This flag value is purely informational and is not validated in any
        way.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --delete-in=DELETE_IN
          Specifies the amount of time until the image will be marked as
          DELETED. Note: The image will not actually be deleted - this field is
          only for informational purposes (see below). For instance, specifying
          30d will mark the image as DELETED in 30 days from the current system
          time. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on duration
          formats.

          Note that the image will not be deleted automatically. The image will
          only be marked as deleted. An explicit request to delete the image
          must be made in order to remove it from the image list. This flag is
          mutually exclusive with --delete-on.

       --delete-on=DELETE_ON
          Similar to --delete-in, but specifies an absolute time when the image
          will be marked as DELETED. Note: The image will not actually be
          deleted - this field is for informational purposes (see the
          description of --delete-in for more details). The date and time
          specified must be valid RFC 3339 full-date or date-time. For times in
          UTC, this looks like YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ. For example:
          2020-01-02T00:00:00Z for midnight on January 2, 2020 in UTC. This
          flag is mutually exclusive with --delete-in.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --deprecate-in=DEPRECATE_IN
          Specifies time (in the same format as --delete-in) until the image
          will be marked DEPRECATED. State will not be changed - it is only for
          informational purposes. This flag is mutually exclusive with
          --deprecate-on.

       --deprecate-on=DEPRECATE_ON
          Specifies time (in the same format as --delete-on) when this image
          will be marked as DEPRECATED. State will not be changed - it has only
          informational purpose. This flag is mutually exclusive with
          --deprecate-in.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --obsolete-in=OBSOLETE_IN
          Specifies time (in the same format as --delete-in) until the image
          will be marked OBSOLETE. State will not be changed - it is only for
          informational purposes. This flag is mutually exclusive with
          --obsolete-on.

       --obsolete-on=OBSOLETE_ON
          Specifies time (in the same format as --delete-on) when this image
          will be marked as OBSOLETE. State will not be changed - it has only
          informational purpose. This flag is mutually exclusive with
          --obsolete-in.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To deprecate an image called 'IMAGE' immediately, mark it as obsolete in
    one day, and mark it as deleted in two days, use:

        $ gcloud alpha compute images deprecate IMAGE --state=DEPRECATED \
            --obsolete-in=1d --delete-in=2d

    To un-deprecate an image called 'IMAGE' and clear times for deprecated,
    obsoleted, and deleted, use:

        $ gcloud alpha compute images deprecate IMAGE --state=ACTIVE

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute images deprecate
        $ gcloud beta compute images deprecate
