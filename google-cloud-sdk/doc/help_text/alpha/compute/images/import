NAME
    gcloud alpha compute images import - import a Google Compute Engine image

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute images import IMAGE_NAME (--os=OS | --no-translate)
        (--source-file=SOURCE_FILE | --source-image=SOURCE_IMAGE) [--async]
        [--log-location=LOG_LOCATION] [--timeout=TIMEOUT; default="2h"]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute images import imports Virtual Disk images,
    such as VMWare VMDK files and VHD files, into Google Compute Engine.

    Importing images involves 3 steps:
      o Upload the virtual disk file to Google Cloud Storage.
      o Import the image to Google Compute Engine.
      o Translate the image to make a bootable image.
    This command will perform all three of these steps as necessary, depending
    on the input arguments specified by the user.

    This command uses the --os flag to choose the appropriate translation. You
    can omit the translation step using the --no-translate flag.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     IMAGE_NAME
        The name of the disk image to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --os=OS
          Specifies the OS of the image being translated. OS must be one of:
          centos-6, centos-7, debian-8, debian-9, rhel-6, rhel-6-byol, rhel-7,
          rhel-7-byol, ubuntu-1404, ubuntu-1604, windows-2008r2,
          windows-2012r2, windows-2016.

       --translate
          Import the disk without making it bootable or installing Google tools
          on it. Enabled by default, use --no-translate to disable.

     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --source-file=SOURCE_FILE
          A local file, or the Google Cloud Storage URI of the virtual disk
          file to import. For example: gs://my-bucket/my-image.vmdk or
          ./my-local-image.vmdk

       --source-image=SOURCE_IMAGE
          The name of the imported image to translate.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Display information about the operation in progress, without waiting
        for the operation to complete.

     --log-location=LOG_LOCATION
        Directory in Google Cloud Storage to hold build logs. If not set,
        gs://<project num>.cloudbuild-logs.googleusercontent.com/ will be
        created and used.

     --timeout=TIMEOUT; default="2h"
        Maximum time a build can last before it is failed as "TIMEOUT". For
        example, specifying 2h will fail the process after 2 hours. See $
        gcloud topic datetimes for information on duration formats.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. Usually,
    users of ALPHA commands and flags need to apply for access, agree to
    applicable terms, and have their projects whitelisted. Contact Google or
    sign up on a product's page for ALPHA access. Product pages can be found at
