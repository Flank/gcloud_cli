NAME
    gcloud alpha compute images export - export a Google Compute Engine image

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute images export --destination-uri=DESTINATION_URI
        (--image=IMAGE | --image-family=IMAGE_FAMILY) [--async]
        [--export-format=EXPORT_FORMAT] [--image-project=IMAGE_PROJECT]
        [--log-location=LOG_LOCATION] [--network=NETWORK] [--subnet=SUBNET]
        [--timeout=TIMEOUT; default="2h"] [--zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute images export exports Virtual Disk images from
    Google Compute Engine.

    By default, images are exported in the Google Compute Engine format, which
    is a disk.raw file that has been tarred and gzipped.

    The --export-format flag will export the image to a format supported by
    QEMU using qemu-img. Valid formats include vmdk, vhdx, vpc, vdi, and qcow2.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --destination-uri=DESTINATION_URI
        The Google Cloud Storage URI destination for the exported virtual disk
        file.

     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --image=IMAGE
          The name of the disk image to export.

       --image-family=IMAGE_FAMILY
          The family of the disk image to be exported. When a family is used
          instead of an image, the latest non-deprecated image associated with
          that family is used.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Display information about the operation in progress, without waiting
        for the operation to complete.

     --export-format=EXPORT_FORMAT
        Specify the format to export to, such as vmdk, vhdx, vpc, or qcow2.

     --image-project=IMAGE_PROJECT
        The project against which all image and image family references will be
        resolved. It is best practice to define image-project.
        * If specifying one of our public images, image-project must be
          provided.
        * If there are several of the same image-family value in multiple
          projects, image-project must be specified to clarify the image to be
          used.
        * If not specified and either image or image-family is provided, the
          current default project is used.

     --log-location=LOG_LOCATION
        Directory in Google Cloud Storage to hold build logs. If not set,
        gs://<project num>.cloudbuild-logs.googleusercontent.com/ will be
        created and used.

     --network=NETWORK
        The name of the network in your project to use for the image export.
        The network must have access to Google Cloud Storage. If not specified,
        the network named default is used.

     --subnet=SUBNET
        Name of the subnetwork in your project to use for the image export. If
        the network resource is in legacy mode, do not provide this property.
        If the network is in auto subnet mode, providing the subnetwork is
        optional. If the network is in custom subnet mode, then this field
        should be specified.

     --timeout=TIMEOUT; default="2h"
        Maximum time a build can last before it is failed as "TIMEOUT". For
        example, specifying 2h will fail the process after 2 hours. See $
        gcloud topic datetimes for information on duration formats.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the image to export. The zone to use when exporting the image.
        Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
        invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
    https://cloud.google.com/support/. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute images export
        $ gcloud beta compute images export
