NAME
    gcloud alpha compute images export - export a Google Compute Engine image

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute images export IMAGE_NAME
        --destination-uri=DESTINATION_URI [--async]
        [--export-format=EXPORT_FORMAT] [--log-location=LOG_LOCATION]
        [--timeout=TIMEOUT; default="2h"] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute images export exports Virtual Disk images from
    Google Compute Engine.

    By default, images are exported in the Google Compute Engine format, which
    is a disk.raw file that has been tarred and gzipped.

    The --export-format flag will export the image to a format supported by
    QEMU using qemu-img. Valid formats include vmdk, vhdx, vpc, vdi, and qcow2.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     IMAGE_NAME
        The name of the disk image to export.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --destination-uri=DESTINATION_URI
        The Google Cloud Storage URI destination for the exported virtual disk
        file.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Display information about the operation in progress, without waiting
        for the operation to complete.

     --export-format=EXPORT_FORMAT
        Specify the format to export to, such as vmdk, vhdx, vpc, or qcow2.

     --log-location=LOG_LOCATION
        Directory in Google Cloud Storage to hold build logs. If not set,
        gs://<project num>.cloudbuild-logs.googleusercontent.com/ will be
        created and used.

     --timeout=TIMEOUT; default="2h"
        Maximum time a build can last before it is failed as "TIMEOUT". For
        example, specifying 2h will fail the process after 2 hours. See $
        gcloud topic datetimes for information on duration formats.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.
