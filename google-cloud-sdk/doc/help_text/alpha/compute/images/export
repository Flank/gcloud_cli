NAME
    gcloud alpha compute images export - export a Compute Engine image

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute images export --destination-uri=DESTINATION_URI
        (--image=IMAGE | --image-family=IMAGE_FAMILY) [--async]
        [--export-format=EXPORT_FORMAT] [--image-project=IMAGE_PROJECT]
        [--log-location=LOG_LOCATION] [--network=NETWORK] [--subnet=SUBNET]
        [--timeout=TIMEOUT; default="2h"] [--zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute images export exports virtual disk images from
    Compute Engine.

    By default, images are exported in the Compute Engine format, which is a
    disk.raw file that is tarred and gzipped.

    The --export-format flag exports the image to a format supported by QEMU
    using qemu-img. Valid formats include 'vmdk', 'vhdx', 'vpc', 'vdi', and
    'qcow2'.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --destination-uri=DESTINATION_URI
        The Cloud Storage URI destination for the exported virtual disk file.

     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --image=IMAGE
          The name of the disk image to export.

       --image-family=IMAGE_FAMILY
          The family of the disk image to be exported. When a family is used
          instead of an image, the latest non-deprecated image associated with
          that family is used.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --export-format=EXPORT_FORMAT
        Specify the format to export to, such as vmdk, vhdx, vpc, or qcow2.

     --image-project=IMAGE_PROJECT
        The Google Cloud project against which all image and image family
        references will be resolved. It is best practice to define
        image-project. A full list of available projects can be generated by
        running gcloud projects list.
        * If specifying one of our public images, image-project must be
          provided.
        * If there are several of the same image-family value in multiple
          projects, image-project must be specified to clarify the image to be
          used.
        * If not specified and either image or image-family is provided, the
          current default project is used.

     --log-location=LOG_LOCATION
        Directory in Cloud Storage to hold build logs. If not set,
        gs://<project num>.cloudbuild-logs.googleusercontent.com/ is created
        and used.

     --network=NETWORK
        The name of the network in your project to use for the image export.
        The network must have access to Cloud Storage. If not specified, the
        network named default is used.

     --subnet=SUBNET
        Name of the subnetwork in your project to use for the image export. If
        the network resource is in legacy mode, do not provide this property.
        If the network is in auto subnet mode, providing the subnetwork is
        optional. If the network is in custom subnet mode, then this field
        should be specified.

     --timeout=TIMEOUT; default="2h"
        Maximum time a build can last before it fails as "TIMEOUT". For
        example, specifying 2h fails the process after 2 hours. See $ gcloud
        topic datetimes for information about duration formats.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the image to export. The zone to use when exporting the image.
        Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
        invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To export a VMDK file my-image from a project my-project to a Cloud Storage
    bucket my-bucket, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute images export --image=my-image \
            --destination-uri=gs://my-bucket/my-image.vmdk \
            --export-format=vmdk --project=my-project

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute images export
        $ gcloud beta compute images export
