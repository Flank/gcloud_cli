NAME
    gcloud alpha compute images set-iam-policy - set IAM policy for a disk
        image

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute images set-iam-policy IMAGE_NAME POLICY_FILE
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute images set-iam-policy replaces the existing
    IAM policy for a disk image, given an image and a file encoded in JSON or
    YAML that contains the IAM policy. If the given policy file specifies an
    "etag" value, then the replacement will succeed only if the policy already
    in place matches that etag. (An etag obtained via get-iam-policy will
    prevent the replacement if the policy for the image has been subsequently
    updated.) A policy file that does not contain an etag value will replace
    any existing policy for the image.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     IMAGE_NAME
        Name of the disk image to set the IAM policy of.

     POLICY_FILE
        JSON or YAML file containing the IAM policy.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    The following command will read an IAM policy defined in a JSON file
    'policy.json' and set it for a disk image with identifier 'my-image'

        $ gcloud alpha compute images set-iam-policy my-image policy.json

    See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details of the
    policy file format and contents.
