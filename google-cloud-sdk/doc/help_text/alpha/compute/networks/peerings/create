NAME
    gcloud alpha compute networks peerings create - create a Google Compute
        Engine network peering

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute networks peerings create NAME --network=NETWORK
        --peer-network=PEER_NETWORK [--async] [--auto-create-routes]
        [--export-custom-routes] [--import-custom-routes]
        [--peer-project=PEER_PROJECT] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Create a Google Compute Engine network peering.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        The name of the peering.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --network=NETWORK
        The name of the network in the current project to be peered with the
        peer network.

     --peer-network=PEER_NETWORK
        The name of the network to be peered with the current network.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Display information about the operation in progress, without waiting
        for the operation to complete.

     --auto-create-routes
        (DEPRECATED) If set, will automatically create routes for the network
        peering. Flag auto-create-routes is deprecated. Peer network subnet
        routes are always created in a network when peered.

        Flag --auto-create-routes is deprecated and will be removed in a future
        release.

     --export-custom-routes
        If set, the network will export custom routes to peer network. Use
        --no-export-custom-routes to disable it.

     --import-custom-routes
        If set, the network will import custom routes from peer network. Use
        --no-import-custom-routes to disable it.

     --peer-project=PEER_PROJECT
        The name of the project for the peer network. If not specified,
        defaults to current project.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
    https://cloud.google.com/support/. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute networks peerings create
        $ gcloud beta compute networks peerings create
