DESCRIPTION

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,

    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To delete a network with the name 'network-name', run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute networks delete network-name

    To delete two networks with the names 'network-name1' and 'network-name2',
    run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute networks delete network-name1 network-name2

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute networks delete
        $ gcloud beta compute networks delete
