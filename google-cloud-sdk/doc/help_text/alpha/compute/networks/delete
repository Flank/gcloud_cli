SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute networks delete NAME [NAME ...] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute networks delete deletes one or more Compute
    Engine networks. Networks can only be deleted when no other resources
    (e.g., virtual machine instances) refer to them.

        Names of the networks to delete.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To delete a network with the name 'network-name', run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute networks delete network-name

    To delete two networks with the names 'network-name1' and 'network-name2',
    run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute networks delete network-name1 network-name2

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access whitelist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute networks delete
        $ gcloud beta compute networks delete
