NAME
    gcloud alpha compute networks subnets delete - delete Google Compute Engine
        subnetworks

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute networks subnets delete NAME [NAME ...]
        [--region=REGION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute networks subnets delete deletes one or more
    Google Compute Engine subnetworks. Subnetworks can only be deleted when no
    other resources (e.g., virtual machine instances) refer to them.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME [NAME ...]
        The names of the subnetworks to delete.

FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        The region of the subnetworks to delete. If not specified, you may be
        prompted to select a region.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. Usually,
    users of ALPHA commands and flags need to apply for access, agree to
    applicable terms, and have their projects whitelisted. Contact Google or
    sign up on a product's page for ALPHA access. Product pages can be found at
