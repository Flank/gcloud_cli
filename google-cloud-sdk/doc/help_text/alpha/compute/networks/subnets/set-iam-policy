DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute networks subnets set-iam-policy sets the Iam
    Policy associated with a Google Compute Engine subnetwork in a project.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the subnetwork to set the IAM Policy of.

     POLICY_FILE
        Path to a local JSON or YAML formatted file containing a valid policy.

FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        Region of the subnetwork to set the IAM Policy of. If not specified,
        you may be prompted to select a region.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
    https://cloud.google.com/support/. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta compute networks subnets set-iam-policy
