DESCRIPTION

    Policy associated with a Google Compute Engine subnetwork in a project.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        The name of the subnetwork to set the IAM Policy of.

     POLICY_FILE
        Path to a local JSON or YAML formatted file containing a valid policy.

FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        The region of the subnetwork to set the IAM Policy of. If not
        specified, you will be prompted to select a region.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
