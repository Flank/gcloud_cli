DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Updates properties of an existing Google Compute Engine subnetwork.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the subnetwork to update.

FLAGS
     --aggregation-interval=AGGREGATION_INTERVAL
        Can only be specified if VPC Flow Logs for this subnetwork is enabled.
        Toggles the aggregation interval for collecting flow logs. Increasing
        the interval time will reduce the amount of generated flow logs for
        long lasting connections. Default is an interval of 5 seconds per
        connection. AGGREGATION_INTERVAL must be one of: interval-10-min,
        interval-15-min, interval-1-min, interval-30-sec, interval-5-min,
        interval-5-sec.

     --drain-timeout=DRAIN_TIMEOUT; default="0s"
        The time period for draining traffic from Internal HTTP(S) Load
        Balancer proxies that are assigned addresses in the current ACTIVE
        subnetwork. For example, 1h, 60m and 3600s each specify a duration of 1
        hour for draining the traffic. Longer times reduce the number of
        proxies that are draining traffic at any one time, and so improve the
        availability of proxies for load balancing. The drain timeout is only
        applicable when the [--role=ACTIVE] flag is being used.

     --flow-sampling=FLOW_SAMPLING
        Can only be specified if VPC Flow Logs for this subnetwork is enabled.
        The value of the field must be in [0, 1]. Set the sampling rate of VPC
        Flow Logs within the subnetwork where 1.0 means all collected logs are
        reported and 0.0 means no logs are reported. Default is 0.5 which means
        half of all collected logs are reported.

     --logging-aggregation-interval=LOGGING_AGGREGATION_INTERVAL
        Can only be specified if VPC Flow Logs for this subnetwork is enabled.
        Toggles the aggregation interval for collecting flow logs. Increasing
        the interval time will reduce the amount of generated flow logs for
        long lasting connections. Default is an interval of 5 seconds per
        connection. LOGGING_AGGREGATION_INTERVAL must be one of:
        interval-10-min, interval-15-min, interval-1-min, interval-30-sec,
        interval-5-min, interval-5-sec.

     --logging-filter-expr=LOGGING_FILTER_EXPR
        Can only be specified if VPC Flow Logs for this subnetwork is enabled.
        Export filter used to define which logs should be generated.

     --logging-flow-sampling=LOGGING_FLOW_SAMPLING
        Can only be specified if VPC Flow logs for this subnetwork is enabled.
        The value of the field must be in [0, 1]. Set the sampling rate of VPC
        flow logs within the subnetwork where 1.0 means all collected logs are
        reported and 0.0 means no logs are reported. Default is 0.5 which means
        half of all collected logs are reported.

     --logging-metadata=LOGGING_METADATA
        Can only be specified if VPC Flow Logs for this subnetwork is enabled.
        Configures whether metadata fields should be added to the reported
        logs. Default is to include all metadata. LOGGING_METADATA must be one
        of: custom, exclude-all, include-all.

     --logging-metadata-fields=[METADATA_FIELD,...]
        Can only be specified if VPC Flow Logs for this subnetwork is enabled
        and "metadata" is set to CUSTOM_METADATA. The comma-separated list of
        metadata fields that should be added to reported logs.

     --metadata=METADATA
        Can only be specified if VPC Flow Logs for this subnetwork is enabled.
        Configures whether metadata fields should be added to the reported
        logs. Default is to include all metadata. METADATA must be one of:
        exclude-all-metadata, include-all-metadata.

     --region=REGION
        Region of the subnetwork to update. If not specified, you may be
        prompted to select a region.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --add-secondary-ranges=PROPERTY=VALUE,[...]
          Adds secondary IP ranges to the subnetwork for use in IP aliasing.

          For example, --add-secondary-ranges range1=192.168.64.0/24 adds a
          secondary range 192.168.64.0/24 with name range1.

          + RANGE_NAME - Name of the secondary range.
          + RANGE - IP range in CIDR format.

         --[no-]enable-flow-logs
            Enable/disable VPC Flow Logs for this subnet. More information for
            VPC Flow Logs can be found at
            https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/using-flow-logs. Use
            --enable-flow-logs to enable and --no-enable-flow-logs to disable.

         --[no-]enable-private-ip-google-access
            Enable/disable access to Google Cloud APIs from this subnet for
            instances without a public ip address. Use
            --enable-private-ip-google-access to enable and
            --no-enable-private-ip-google-access to disable.

         --[no-]enable-private-ipv6-access
            Enable/disable private IPv6 access for the subnet. Use
            --enable-private-ipv6-access to enable and
            --no-enable-private-ipv6-access to disable.

         --remove-secondary-ranges=PROPERTY=VALUE,[...]
            Removes secondary ranges from the subnetwork.

            For example, --remove-secondary-ranges range2,range3 removes the
            secondary ranges with names range2 and range3.

         --role=ROLE
            The role is set to ACTIVE to update a BACKUP reserved address range
            to be the new ACTIVE address range. Note that the only supported
            value for this flag is ACTIVE since setting an address range to
            BACKUP is not supported.

            This field is only valid when updating a reserved IP address range
            used for the purpose of Internal HTTP(S) Load Balancer.

            ROLE must be (currently only one value is supported):

             ACTIVE
                The ACTIVE subnet that is currently used.

         --private-ipv6-google-access-service-accounts=[EMAIL,...]
            The service accounts can be used to selectively turn on Private
            IPv6 Google Access only on the VMs primary service account matching
            the value.

            Setting this will override the existing Private IPv6 Google Access
            service accounts for the subnetwork. The following will clear the
            existing Private IPv6 Google Access service accounts:

            $ gcloud alpha compute networks subnets update MY-SUBNET \
            --private-ipv6-google-access-service-accounts ''

         --private-ipv6-google-access-type=PRIVATE_IPV6_GOOGLE_ACCESS_TYPE
            The private IPv6 google access type for the VMs in this subnet.
            PRIVATE_IPV6_GOOGLE_ACCESS_TYPE must be one of: disable,
            enable-bidirectional-access, enable-outbound-vm-access,
            enable-outbound-vm-access-for-service-accounts.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access whitelist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute networks subnets update
        $ gcloud beta compute networks subnets update
