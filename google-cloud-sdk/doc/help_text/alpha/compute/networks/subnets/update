DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Updates properties of an existing Google Compute Engine subnetwork.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the subnetwork to update.

FLAGS
     --aggregation-interval=AGGREGATION_INTERVAL
        Can only be specified if VPC flow logging for this subnetwork is
        enabled. Toggles the aggregation interval for collecting flow logs.
        Increasing the interval time will reduce the amount of generated flow
        logs for long lasting connections. Default is an interval of 5 seconds
        per connection. AGGREGATION_INTERVAL must be one of: interval-5-sec,
        interval-30-sec, interval-1-min, interval-5-min, interval-10-min,
        interval-15-min.

     --drain-timeout=DRAIN_TIMEOUT; default="0s"
        The drain timeout specifies the upper bound in seconds on the amount of
        time allowed to drain connections from the current ACTIVE subnetwork to
        the current BACKUP subnetwork. The drain timeout is only applicable
        when the [--set-role-active] flag is being used.

     --flow-sampling=FLOW_SAMPLING
        Can only be specified if VPC flow logging for this subnetwork is
        enabled. The value of the field must be in [0, 1]. Set the sampling
        rate of VPC flow logs within the subnetwork where 1.0 means all
        collected logs are reported and 0.0 means no logs are reported. Default
        is 0.5 which means half of all collected logs are reported.

     --metadata=METADATA
        Can only be specified if VPC flow logging for this subnetwork is
        enabled. Configures whether metadata fields should be added to the
        reported VPC flow logs. Default is to include all metadata. METADATA
        must be one of: include-all-metadata, exclude-all-metadata.

     --region=REGION
        Region of the subnetwork to update. If not specified, you may be
        prompted to select a region.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --add-secondary-ranges=PROPERTY=VALUE,[...]
          Adds secondary IP ranges to the subnetwork for use in IP aliasing.

          For example, --add-secondary-ranges range1=192.168.64.0/24 adds a
          secondary range 192.168.64.0/24 with name range1.

          + RANGE_NAME - Name of the secondary range.
          + RANGE - IP range in CIDR format.

         --[no-]enable-flow-logs
            Enable/disable VPC flow logging for this subnet. More information
            for VPC flow logs can be found at
            https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/using-flow-logs. Use
            --enable-flow-logs to enable and --no-enable-flow-logs to disable.

         --[no-]enable-private-ip-google-access
            Enable/disable access to Google Cloud APIs from this subnet for
            instances without a public ip address. Use
            --enable-private-ip-google-access to enable and
            --no-enable-private-ip-google-access to disable.

         --remove-secondary-ranges=PROPERTY=VALUE,[...]
            Removes secondary ranges from the subnetwork.

            For example, --remove-secondary-ranges range2,range3 removes the
            secondary ranges with names range2 and range3.

         --role=ROLE
            The role is set to ACTIVE to update a BACKUP reserved address range
            to be the new ACTIVE address range. Note that the only supported
            value for this flag is ACTIVE since setting an address range to
            BACKUP is not supported.

            This field is only valid when updating a reserved IP address range
            used for the purpose of Internal HTTP(S) Load Balancer.

            ROLE must be (currently only one value is supported):

         ACTIVE
            The ACTIVE subnet that is currently used.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
    https://cloud.google.com/support/. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute networks subnets update
        $ gcloud beta compute networks subnets update
