DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Define a subnet for a network in custom subnet mode. Subnets must
    be uniquely named per region.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the subnetwork to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --network=NETWORK
        The network to which the subnetwork belongs.

     --range=RANGE
        The IP space allocated to this subnetwork in CIDR format.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --aggregation-interval=AGGREGATION_INTERVAL
        Can only be specified if VPC Flow Logs for this subnetwork is enabled.
        Toggles the aggregation interval for collecting flow logs. Increasing
        the interval time will reduce the amount of generated flow logs for
        long lasting connections. Default is an interval of 5 seconds per
        connection. AGGREGATION_INTERVAL must be one of: interval-10-min,
        interval-15-min, interval-1-min, interval-30-sec, interval-5-min,
        interval-5-sec.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional description of this subnetwork.

     --enable-flow-logs
        Enable/disable VPC Flow Logs for this subnet. More information for VPC
        Flow Logs can be found at
        https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/using-flow-logs.

     --enable-private-ip-google-access
        Enable/disable access to Google Cloud APIs from this subnet for
        instances without a public ip address.

     --flow-sampling=FLOW_SAMPLING
        Can only be specified if VPC flow logging for this subnetwork is
        enabled. The value of the field must be in [0, 1]. Set the sampling
        rate of VPC flow logs within the subnetwork where 1.0 means all
        collected logs are reported and 0.0 means no logs are reported. Default
        is 0.5 which means half of all collected logs are reported.

     --logging-aggregation-interval=LOGGING_AGGREGATION_INTERVAL
        Can only be specified if VPC Flow Logs for this subnetwork is enabled.
        Toggles the aggregation interval for collecting flow logs. Increasing
        the interval time will reduce the amount of generated flow logs for
        long lasting connections. Default is an interval of 5 seconds per
        connection. LOGGING_AGGREGATION_INTERVAL must be one of:
        interval-10-min, interval-15-min, interval-1-min, interval-30-sec,
        interval-5-min, interval-5-sec.

     --logging-filter-expr=LOGGING_FILTER_EXPR
        Can only be specified if VPC Flow Logs for this subnetwork is enabled.
        Export filter used to define which logs should be generated.

     --logging-flow-sampling=LOGGING_FLOW_SAMPLING
        Can only be specified if VPC Flow Logs for this subnetwork is enabled.
        The value of the field must be in [0, 1]. Set the sampling rate of VPC
        flow logs within the subnetwork where 1.0 means all collected logs are
        reported and 0.0 means no logs are reported. Default is 0.5 which means
        half of all collected logs are reported.

     --logging-metadata=LOGGING_METADATA
        Can only be specified if VPC Flow Logs for this subnetwork is enabled.
        Configures whether metadata fields should be added to the reported
        logs. Default is to include all metadata. Note that "include-all" does
        not include GKE annotations. LOGGING_METADATA must be one of: custom,
        exclude-all, include-all.

     --logging-metadata-fields=[METADATA_FIELD,...]
        Can only be specified if VPC Flow Logs for this subnetwork is enabled
        and "metadata" is set to CUSTOM_METADATA. The comma-separated list of
        metadata fields that should be added to reported logs.

     --metadata=METADATA
        Can only be specified if VPC Flow Logs for this subnetwork is enabled.
        Configures whether metadata fields should be added to the reported
        logs. Default is to include all metadata. Note that "include-all" does
        not include GKE annotations. METADATA must be one of:
        exclude-all-metadata, include-all-metadata.

     --private-ipv6-google-access-type=PRIVATE_IPV6_GOOGLE_ACCESS_TYPE
        The private IPv6 google access type for the VMs in this subnet.
        PRIVATE_IPV6_GOOGLE_ACCESS_TYPE must be one of: disable,
        enable-bidirectional-access, enable-outbound-vm-access.

     --purpose=PURPOSE
        The purpose of this subnetwork. PURPOSE must be one of:

         AGGREGATE
            Reserved for Aggregate Ranges used for aggregating private
            subnetworks.
         INTERNAL_HTTPS_LOAD_BALANCER
            Reserved for Internal HTTP(S) Load Balancing.
         PRIVATE
            Regular user created or automatically created subnet.

     --region=REGION
        Region of the subnetwork to create. If not specified, you may be
        prompted to select a region.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     --role=ROLE
        The role of subnetwork. This field is required when
        purpose=INTERNAL_HTTPS_LOAD_BALANCER. The value can be set to ACTIVE or
        BACKUP. An ACTIVE subnetwork is one that is currently being used for
        Internal HTTP(S) Load Balancing. A BACKUP subnetwork is one that is
        ready to be promoted to ACTIVE or is currently draining. ROLE must be
        one of:

         ACTIVE
            The ACTIVE subnet that is currently used.
         BACKUP
            The BACKUP subnet that could be promoted to ACTIVE.

     --secondary-range=PROPERTY=VALUE,[...]
        Adds a secondary IP range to the subnetwork for use in IP aliasing.

        For example, --secondary-range range1=192.168.64.0/24 adds a secondary
        range 192.168.64.0/24 with name range1.

        * RANGE_NAME - Name of the secondary range.
        * RANGE - IP range in CIDR format.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute networks subnets create
        $ gcloud beta compute networks subnets create
