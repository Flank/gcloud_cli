NAME
    gcloud alpha compute networks vpc-access connectors delete - delete a VPC
        Access connector

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute networks vpc-access connectors delete
        (CONNECTOR : --region=REGION) [--async] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Delete a new VPC Access connector with the given name.

    This command can fail for the following reasons:
      o An instance with the same name already exists.
      o The active account does not have permission to delete instances.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Connector resource - Arguments and flags that specify the VPC Access
     connector you want to delete. The arguments in this group can be used to
     specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not
     given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the
     [project] attribute: provide the argument [connector] on the command line
     with a fully specified name; provide the argument [--project] on the
     command line; set the property [core/project]. This must be specified.

       CONNECTOR
          ID of the connector or fully qualified identifier for the connector.
          This positional must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --region=REGION
          Compute region (e.g. us-central1) for the connector.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the vpcaccess/v1alpha1 API. The full documentation for
    this API can be found at: http://cloud.google.com

EXAMPLES
    The following command deletes a VPC Access connector with name
    my-vpc-connector in region us-central1:

        $ gcloud alpha compute networks vpc-access connectors delete \
            my-vpc-connector --region=us-central1

NOTES
    This command is an internal implementation detail and may change or
    disappear without notice. This command is currently in ALPHA and may change
    without notice. If this command fails with API permission errors despite
    specifying the right project, you may be trying to access an API with an
    invitation-only early access whitelist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute networks vpc-access connectors delete
        $ gcloud beta compute networks vpc-access connectors delete
