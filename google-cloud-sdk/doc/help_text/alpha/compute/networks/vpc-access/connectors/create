NAME
    gcloud alpha compute networks vpc-access connectors create - create a VPC
        Access connector

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute networks vpc-access connectors create
        (CONNECTOR : --region=REGION) --network=NETWORK --range=RANGE [--async]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Create a new VPC Access connector with the given name.

    This command can fail for the following reasons:
      o An instance with the same name already exists.
      o The active account does not have permission to create instances.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Connector resource - Arguments and flags that specify the VPC Access
     connector you want to create. The arguments in this group can be used to
     specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not
     given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the
     [project] attribute: provide the flag [connector] on the command line with
     a fully specified name; provide the flag [--project] on the command line;
     set the property [core/project]. This must be specified.

       CONNECTOR
          The ID of the connector or a fully qualified identifier for the
          connector. This positional must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --region=REGION
          A Google Compute Engine for VPC Access API.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --network=NETWORK
        The name of the Google Compute Engine network to which the connector
        will be connected. If left unspecified, the default network will be
        used.

     --range=RANGE
        The CIDR range of internal addresses that are reserved for this
        connector. For example, 10.132.0.0/28. Range must be unique and
        non-overlapping with existing ranges in the network.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Display information about the operation in progress, without waiting
        for the operation to complete.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the vpcaccess/v1alpha1 API. The full documentation for
    this API can be found at: http://cloud.google.com

EXAMPLES
    The following command creates a VPC Access connector with name
    my-vpc-connector in region us-central1 in network my-network with IP CIDR
    range of 10.132.0.0/28.

        $ gcloud alpha compute networks vpc-access connectors create \
            my-vpc-connector --region=us-central1 --network=my-network
          --range=10.132.0.0/28

NOTES
    This command is an internal implementation detail and may change or
    disappear without notice. This command is currently in ALPHA and may change
    without notice. If this command fails with API permission errors despite
    specifying the right project, you will have to apply for early access and
    have your projects registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so,
