NAME
    gcloud alpha compute networks vpc-access connectors describe - show
        metadata for a VPC Access connector

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute networks vpc-access connectors describe
        (CONNECTOR : --region=REGION) [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Display all metadata associated with a VPC Access connector given a
    valid connector name.

    This command can fail for the following reasons:
      o The connector specified does not exist.
      o The active account does not have permission to access the given
        operation.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Connector resource - The connector to describe. The arguments in this
     group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some
     attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other
     ways. To set the [project] attribute: provide the argument [connector] on
     the command line with a fully specified name; provide the argument
     [--project] on the command line; set the property [core/project]. This
     must be specified.

       CONNECTOR
          ID of the connector or fully qualified identifier for the connector.
          This positional must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --region=REGION
          A Google Compute Engine for VPC Access API.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the vpcaccess/v1alpha1 API. The full documentation for
    this API can be found at: http://cloud.google.com

EXAMPLES
    The following command prints metadata for a connector with name
    my-vpcaccesss-connector in region us-central1:

        $ gcloud alpha compute networks vpc-access connectors describe \
            my-vpcaccess-connector --region=us-central

NOTES
    This command is an internal implementation detail and may change or
    disappear without notice. This command is currently in ALPHA and may change
    without notice. If this command fails with API permission errors despite
    specifying the right project, you will have to apply for early access and
    have your projects registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so,
