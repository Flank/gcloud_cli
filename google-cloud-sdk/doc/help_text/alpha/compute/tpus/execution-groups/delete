NAME
    gcloud alpha compute tpus execution-groups delete - delete TPU Node + VM
        created by execution group

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute tpus execution-groups delete EXECUTION_GROUP_NAME
        [--zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Delete TPU Node + VM created by execution group.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     EXECUTION_GROUP_NAME
        The execution group name to delete.

FLAGS
     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the tpu to delete. If not specified and the compute/zone
        property isn't set, you may be prompted to select a zone.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
