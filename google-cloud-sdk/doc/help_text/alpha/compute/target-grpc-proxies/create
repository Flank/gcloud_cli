NAME
    gcloud alpha compute target-grpc-proxies create - create a target gRPC
        proxy

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute target-grpc-proxies create NAME --url-map=URL_MAP
        [--description=DESCRIPTION] [--validate-for-proxyless]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute target-grpc-proxies create is used to create
    target gRPC proxies. A target gRPC proxy is a component of load balancers
    intended for load balancing gRPC traffic. Global forwarding rules reference
    a target gRPC proxy. The Target gRPC proxy references a URL map which
    specifies how traffic routes to gRPC backend services.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the target gRPC proxy to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --url-map=URL_MAP
        A reference to a URL map resource. A URL map defines the mapping of
        URLs to backend services. Before you can refer to a URL map, you must
        create the URL map. To delete a URL map that a target proxy is
        referring to, you must first delete the target gRPC proxy.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional, textual description for the target gRPC proxy.

     --validate-for-proxyless
        If specified, indicates that the BackendServices referenced by the
        urlMap may be accessed by gRPC applications without using a sidecar
        proxy. This will enable configuration checks on urlMap and its
        referenced BackendServices to not allow unsupported features. A gRPC
        application must use "xds-experimental:///" scheme in the target URI of
        the service it is connecting to.

        If unspecified, indicates that the BackendServices referenced by the
        urlMap will be accessed by gRPC applications via a sidecar proxy. In
        this case, a gRPC application must not use "xds-experimental:///"
        scheme in the target URI of the service it is connecting to.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    If there is an already-created URL map with the name URL_MAP, create a
    global target gRPC proxy pointing to this map by running:

        $ gcloud alpha compute target-grpc-proxies create PROXY_NAME \
            --url-map=URL_MAP

    To create a proxy with a textual description, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute target-grpc-proxies create PROXY_NAME \
            --url-map=URL_MAP --description="default proxy"

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access whitelist.
