NAME
    gcloud alpha compute in-place-snapshots delete - delete Google Compute
        Engine in-place snapshots

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute in-place-snapshots delete IN_PLACE_SNAPSHOT_NAME
        [IN_PLACE_SNAPSHOT_NAME ...] [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Delete Google Compute Engine in-place snapshots.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     IN_PLACE_SNAPSHOT_NAME [IN_PLACE_SNAPSHOT_NAME ...]
        Names of the in-place snapshots to delete.

FLAGS
     At most one of these may be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the in-place snapshots to delete. If not specified, you may
          be prompted to select a region.

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/region property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/region

          Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the in-place snapshots to delete. If not specified and the
          compute/zone property isn't set, you may be prompted to select a
          zone.

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/zone property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

          Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,

NOTES

    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access whitelist.
