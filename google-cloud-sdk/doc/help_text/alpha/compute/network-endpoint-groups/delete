NAME
    gcloud alpha compute network-endpoint-groups delete - deletes a Google
        Compute Engine network endpoint group

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute network-endpoint-groups delete NAME [--zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Deletes a Google Compute Engine network endpoint group.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the network endpoint group to operate on.

FLAGS
     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the network endpoint group to operate on. If not specified and
        the compute/zone property isn't set, you may be prompted to select a
        zone.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
    https://cloud.google.com/support/. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta compute network-endpoint-groups delete
