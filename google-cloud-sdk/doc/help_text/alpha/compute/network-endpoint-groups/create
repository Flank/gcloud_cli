NAME
    gcloud alpha compute network-endpoint-groups create - create a Google
        Compute Engine network endpoint group

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute network-endpoint-groups create NAME
        [--default-port=DEFAULT_PORT] [--network=NETWORK]
        [--network-endpoint-type=NETWORK_ENDPOINT_TYPE;
          default="gce-vm-ip-port"] [--subnet=SUBNET] [--global | --zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the network endpoint group to operate on.

FLAGS
     --default-port=DEFAULT_PORT
        The default port to use if the port number is not specified in the
        network endpoint.

        If this flag isn't specified for a NEG with endpoint type
        GCE_VM_IP_PORT or NON_GCP_PRIVATE_IP_PORT, then every network endpoint
        in the network endpoint group must have a port specified. For a NEG
        with endpoint type INTERNET_IP_PORT and INTERNET_FQDN_PORT. If the
        default port is not specified the well known port for your backend
        protocol will be used (80 for http, 443 for https).

     --network=NETWORK
        Name of the network in which the NEG is created. default project
        network is used if unspecified.

        This is only supported for NEGs with endpoint type GCE_VM_IP_PORT or
        NON_GCP_PRIVATE_IP_PORT or GCE_VM_PRIMARY_IP.

     --network-endpoint-type=NETWORK_ENDPOINT_TYPE; default="gce-vm-ip-port"
        Determines the spec of endpoints attached to this group.

        * GCE_VM_IP_PORT

              Endpoint IP address must belong to a VM in Google Compute Engine
              (either the primary IP or as part of an aliased IP range).
              The `--default-port` must be specified or every network endpoint
              in the network endpoint group must have a port specified.

        * INTERNET_IP_PORT

              Endpoint IP address must be publicly routable address. The default
              port will be used if specified. If the default port is not
              specified, the well known port for your backend protocol will be
              used as the default port (80 for http,  443 for https).

        * INTERNET_FQDN_PORT

              Endpoint FQDN must be resolvable to a public IP address via public
              DNS. The default port will be used if specified. If the default
              port is not specified, the well known port for your backend
              protocol will be used as the default port (80 for http, 443 for
              https).

        * NON_GCP_PRIVATE_IP_PORT

              Endpoint IP address must belong to a VM not in Google Compute
              Engine and must be routable using a cloud router over VPN or an
              Interconnect. In this case the NEG must be zonal. The
              `--default-port` must be specified or every network endpoint in
              the network endpoint group must have a port specified.

        * GCE_VM_PRIMARY_IP

              Endpoint IP address must be the primary IP of a VM's primary
              network interface in Google Compute Engine.

    NETWORK_ENDPOINT_TYPE must be one of: gce-vm-ip-port, internet-ip-port,
    internet-fqdn-port, non-gcp-private-ip-port, gce-vm-primary-ip.

     --subnet=SUBNET
        Name of the subnet to which all network endpoints belong.

        If not specified, network endpoints may belong to any subnetwork in the
        region where the network endpoint group is created.

        This is only supported for NEGs with endpoint type GCE_VM_IP_PORT or
        GCE_VM_PRIMARY_IP.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --global
          If set, the network endpoint group is global.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the network endpoint group to operate on. If not specified
          and the compute/zone property isn't set, you may be prompted to
          select a zone.

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/zone property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

          Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

EXAMPLES
    To create a network endpoint group:

        $ gcloud alpha compute network-endpoint-groups create my-neg \
            --zone=us-central1-a --network=my-network \
        --subnet=my-subnetwork

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access whitelist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute network-endpoint-groups create
        $ gcloud beta compute network-endpoint-groups create
