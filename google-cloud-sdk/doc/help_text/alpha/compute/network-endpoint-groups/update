NAME
    gcloud alpha compute network-endpoint-groups update - updates a Google
        Compute Engine network endpoint group

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute network-endpoint-groups update NAME [--zone=ZONE]
        [--add-endpoint=[instance=INSTANCE],[ip=IP],[port=PORT]
          | --remove-endpoint=[instance=INSTANCE],[ip=IP],[port=PORT]]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the network endpoint group to operate on.

FLAGS
     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the network endpoint group to operate on. If not specified and
        the compute/zone property isn't set, you may be prompted to select a
        zone.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

     These flags can be specified multiple times to add/remove multiple
     endpoints. At most one of these may be specified:

       --add-endpoint=[instance=INSTANCE],[ip=IP],[port=PORT]
          The network endpoint to add to the network endpoint group. Allowed
          keys are:

          + instance - Name of instance in same zone as network endpoint
            group.

                The VM instance must belong to the network / subnetwork associated
                with the network endpoint group. If the VM instance is deleted, then
                any network endpoint group that has a reference to it is updated.
                The delete causes all network endpoints on the VM to be removed
                from the network endpoint group.

          + ip - Optional IP address of the network endpoint.

                Optional IP address of the network endpoint. If the IP address is
                not specified then, we use the primary IP address for the VM
                instance in the network that the NEG belongs to.

          + port - Optional port for the network endpoint.

                Optional port for the network endpoint. If not specified and the
                networkEndpointType is `GCE_VM_IP_PORT`, the defaultPort for the
                network endpoint group will be used.

         --remove-endpoint=[instance=INSTANCE],[ip=IP],[port=PORT]
            The network endpoint to detach from the network endpoint group.
            Allowed keys are:

            + instance - Name of instance in same zone as network endpoint
              group.

            + ip - Optional IP address of the network endpoint.

                  If the IP address is not specified then all network endpoints that
                  belong to the instance are removed from the NEG.

            + port - Optional port for the network endpoint. Required if the
              network endpoint type is GCE_VM_IP_PORT.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To add two endpoints to a network endpoint group:

        $ gcloud alpha compute network-endpoint-groups update my-neg \
            --zone us-central1-a \
          --add-endpoint instance=my-instance1,ip=127.0.0.1,port=1234 \
          --add-endpoint instance=my-instance2

    To remove two endpoints from a network endpoint group:

        $ gcloud alpha compute network-endpoint-groups update my-neg \
            --zone us-central1-a \
          --remove-endpoint instance=my-instance1,ip=127.0.0.1,port=1234 \
          --remove-endpoint instance=my-instance2

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at

        $ gcloud beta compute network-endpoint-groups update
