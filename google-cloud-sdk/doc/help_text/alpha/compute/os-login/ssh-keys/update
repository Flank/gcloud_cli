NAME
    gcloud alpha compute os-login ssh-keys update - update an SSH public key in
        an OS Login profile

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute os-login ssh-keys update --ttl=TTL
        (--key=KEY | --key-file=KEY_FILE) [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute os-login ssh-keys update will take either a
    string containing an SSH public key or a filename for an SSH public key and
    will update the key in the user's OS Login profile. Currently, only the
    expiration time, --ttl, can be updated.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --ttl=TTL
        The amount of time before the SSH key expires. For example, specifying
        30m will set the expiration time on the SSH key for 30 minutes from the
        current time. A value of 0 will result in no expiration time. See $
        gcloud topic datetimes for information on duration formats.

     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --key=KEY
          The SSH public key to update the OS Login Profile. Key value can
          either be the SSH key or the OS Login fingerprint of the key.

       --key-file=KEY_FILE
          The path to a file containing an SSH public key to update the OS
          Login Profile. Key value can either be the SSH key or the OS Login
          fingerprint of the key.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.
