NAME
    gcloud alpha compute os-login ssh-keys add - add an SSH public key to an OS
        Login profile

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute os-login ssh-keys add
        (--key=KEY | --key-file=KEY_FILE) [--ttl=TTL] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute os-login ssh-keys add will take either a
    string containing an SSH public key or a filename for an SSH public key and
    will add that key to the user's OS Login profile.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --key=KEY
          The SSH public key to add to the OS Login Profile.

       --key-file=KEY_FILE
          The path to a file containing an SSH public key to add to the OS
          Login Profile.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --ttl=TTL
        The amount of time before the SSH key expires. For example, specifying
        30m will set the expiration time on the SSH key for 30 minutes from the
        current time. A value of 0 will result in no expiration time. See $
        gcloud topic datetimes for information on duration formats.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
