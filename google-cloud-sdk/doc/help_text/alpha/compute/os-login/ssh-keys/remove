        (--key=KEY | --key-file=KEY_FILE) [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute os-login ssh-keys remove will take either a
    string containing an SSH public key or a filename for an SSH public key and
    will remove that key from the user's OS Login profile. The key value passed
    in can either be the full SSH key or the OS Login fingerprint for that key.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --key=KEY
          The SSH public key to remove from the OS Login Profile. Key value can
          either be the SSH key or the OS Login fingerprint of the key.

       --key-file=KEY_FILE
          The path to a file containing an SSH public key to remove from the OS
          Login Profile. Key value can either be the SSH key or the OS Login
          fingerprint of the key.
