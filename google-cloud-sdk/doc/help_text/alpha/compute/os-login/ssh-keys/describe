NAME
    gcloud alpha compute os-login ssh-keys describe - describe an SSH Public
        Key from an OS Login Profile

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute os-login ssh-keys describe
        (--key=KEY | --key-file=KEY_FILE) [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute os-login ssh-keys describe will take either a
    string containing an SSH Public Key or a filename for an SSH Public key and
    will display that key from the user's OS Login Profile. The key value
    passed in can either be the full SSH key or the OS Login fingerprint for
    that key.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --key=KEY
          The SSH public key to describe from the OS Login Profile. Key value
          can either be the SSH key or the OS Login fingerprint of the key.

       --key-file=KEY_FILE
          The path to a file containing an SSH public key to describe from the
          OS Login Profile. Key value can either be the SSH key or the OS Login
          fingerprint of the key.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
