DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed create creates a
    Compute Engine managed instance group.

    For example, running:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed create \
        example-managed-instance-group --zone us-central1-a \
        --template example-instance-template --size 1

    will create one managed instance group called
    'example-managed-instance-group' in the us-central1-a zone.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the managed instance group to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --size=SIZE
        The initial number of instances you want in this group.

     --template=TEMPLATE
        Specifies the instance template to use when creating new instances.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --base-instance-name=BASE_INSTANCE_NAME
        The base name to use for the Compute Engine instances that will be
        created with the managed instance group. If not provided base instance
        name will be the prefix of instance group name.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional description for this group.

     --initial-delay=INITIAL_DELAY
        Specifies the length of time during which the instance is known to be
        initializing and should not be autohealed even if unhealthy. This value
        cannot be greater than 1 hour. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for
        information on duration formats.

     --instance-redistribution-type=TYPE
        Specifies the type of the instance redistribution policy. An instance
        redistribution type lets you enable or disable automatic instance
        redistribution across zones to meet the target distribution. The target
        distribution is a state of a regional managed instance group where all
        instances are spread out evenly across all target zones.

        An instance redistribution type can be specified only for a
        non-autoscaled regional managed instance group. By default it is set to
        PROACTIVE.

        The following types are available:

        * NONE - The managed instance group does not redistribute instances
          across zones.

        * PROACTIVE - The managed instance group proactively redistributes
          instances to meet its target distribution.

    TYPE must be one of: NONE, PROACTIVE.

     --stateful-disk=[auto-delete=AUTO-DELETE],[device-name=DEVICE-NAME]
        Disks considered stateful by the instance group. Managed instance
        groups preserve and reattach stateful disks on VM autohealing, update,
        and recreate events.

        Use this argument multiple times to attach more disks.

         device-name
            (Requied) Device name of the disk to mark stateful.

         auto-delete
            (Optional) Specifies the auto deletion policy of the stateful disk.
            Supported values are never (never delete this disk) and
            on-permanent-instance-deletion (delete the stateful disk when the
            given instance is permanently deleted from the instance group; for
            example when the group is resized down). If omitted, never is used
            as the default.

     --target-distribution-shape=SHAPE
        Specifies how a regional managed instance group distributes its
        instances across zones within the region.

            The following target shape are available:

        * EVEN ‒ The group schedules VM instance creation and deletion in a
          way that maintains an even number of managed instances across the
          selected zones. Recommended for highly available serving workloads.
        * BALANCED ‒ The group prioritizes acquisition of resources -
          scheduling VMs in zones where resources are available - while
          distributing VMs as evenly as possible across selected zones to
          minimize the impact of zone-level failure. Recommended for highly
          available serving or batch workloads that do not require autoscaling.
        * ANY ‒ The group picks zones for creating VM instances to fulfill
          the requested number of VMs within present capacity constraints.
          Recommended for batch workloads that do not require high
          availability.

    If not specified, the default shape is EVEN.

    SHAPE must be one of: EVEN, ANY, BALANCED.

     --target-pool=[TARGET_POOL,...]
        Specifies any target pools you want the instances of this managed
        instance group to be part of.

     --zones=ZONE,[ZONE,...]
        If this flag is specified a regional managed instance group will be
        created. The managed instance group will be in the same region as
        specified zones and will spread instances in it between specified
        zones.

        All zones must belong to the same region. You may specify --region flag
        but it must be the region to which zones belong. This flag is mutually
        exclusive with --zone flag.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --health-check=HEALTH_CHECK
          Name of the health check to operate on.

       --http-health-check=HTTP_HEALTH_CHECK
          (DEPRECATED) HTTP health check object used for autohealing instances
          in this group.

          HttpHealthCheck is deprecated. Use --health-check instead.

       --https-health-check=HTTPS_HEALTH_CHECK
          (DEPRECATED) HTTPS health check object used for autohealing instances
          in this group.

          HttpsHealthCheck is deprecated. Use --health-check instead.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the managed instance group to create. If not specified, you
          may be prompted to select a region.

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

    If you specify --zones flag this flag must be unspecified or specify the
    region to which the zones you listed belong.

    Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
    invocation.

         --zone=ZONE
            Zone of the managed instance group to create. If not specified, you
            may be prompted to select a zone.

            A list of zones can be fetched by running:

                $ gcloud compute zones list

            Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
            invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute instance-groups managed create
        $ gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed create
