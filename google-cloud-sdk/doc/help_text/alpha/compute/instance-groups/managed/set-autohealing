NAME
    gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed set-autohealing - set
        autohealing policy for managed instance group

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed set-autohealing NAME
        [--initial-delay=INITIAL_DELAY]
        [--health-check=HEALTH_CHECK | --http-health-check=HTTP_HEALTH_CHECK
          | --https-health-check=HTTPS_HEALTH_CHECK]
        [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed set-autohealing
    updates the autohealing policy for an existing managed instance group.

    If --http-health-check or --https-health-check is specified, the resulting
    autohealing policy will be triggered by the health-check i.e. the
    autohealing action (RECREATE) on an instance will be performed if the
    health-check signals that the instance is UNHEALTHY. If neither
    --http-health-check nor --https-health-check is specified, the resulting
    autohealing policy will be triggered by instance's status i.e. the
    autohealing action (RECREATE) on an instance will be performed if the
    instance.status is not RUNNING. --initial-delay specifies the length of the
    period during which IGM will refrain from autohealing the instance even if
    the instance is reported as not RUNNING or UNHEALTHY. This value must be
    from range [0, 3600].

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        The name of the managed instance group to operate on.

FLAGS
     --initial-delay=INITIAL_DELAY
        Specifies the length of the period during which the instance is known
        to be initializing and should not be autohealed even if unhealthy. This
        value cannot be greater than 1 hour. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for
        information on duration formats.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --health-check=HEALTH_CHECK
          The name of the health check to operate on.

       --http-health-check=HTTP_HEALTH_CHECK
          Specifies the HTTP health check object used for autohealing instances
          in this group.

       --https-health-check=HTTPS_HEALTH_CHECK
          Specifies the HTTPS health check object used for autohealing
          instances in this group.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --region=REGION
          The region of the managed instance group to operate on. If not
          specified, you will be prompted to select a region.

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          The zone of the managed instance group to operate on. If not
          specified, you may be prompted to select a zone.

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
          invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. Usually,
    users of ALPHA commands and flags need to apply for access, agree to
    applicable terms, and have their projects whitelisted. Contact Google or
    sign up on a product's page for ALPHA access. Product pages can be found at
