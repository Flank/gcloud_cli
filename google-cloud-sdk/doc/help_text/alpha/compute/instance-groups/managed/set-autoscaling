DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed set-autoscaling sets
    autoscaling parameters of specified managed instance group.

    Autoscalers can use one or more policies listed below. Information on using
    multiple policies can be found here:
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/autoscaler/multiple-policies

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the managed instance group to operate on.

FLAGS
     --autoscaling-file=PATH
        Path of the file from which autoscaling configuration will be loaded.
        This flag allows you to atomically setup complex autoscalers.

     --cool-down-period=COOL_DOWN_PERIOD
        The time period that the autoscaler should wait before it starts
        collecting information from a new instance. This prevents the
        autoscaler from collecting information when the instance is
        initializing, during which the collected usage would not be reliable.
        The default is 60s. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on
        duration formats.

     --cpu-utilization-predictive-method=CPU_UTILIZATION_PREDICTIVE_METHOD
        Indicates which method of prediction is used for CPU utilization
        metric, if any. CPU_UTILIZATION_PREDICTIVE_METHOD must be one of:

         none
            (Default) No predictions are made based on the scaling metric when
            calculating the number of VM instances.
         standard
            Standard predictive autoscaling predicts the future values of the
            scaling metric and then scales a MIG to ensure that new VM
            instances are ready in time to cover the predicted peak.

     --custom-metric-utilization=[metric=METRIC],[utilization-target=UTILIZATION-TARGET],[utilization-target-type=UTILIZATION-TARGET-TYPE]
        Adds a target metric value for the Autoscaler to use.

         metric
            Protocol-free URL of a Google Cloud Monitoring metric.

         utilization-target
            Value of the metric Autoscaler will aim to maintain (greater than
            0.0).

         utilization-target-type
            How target is expressed. Valid values: DELTA_PER_MINUTE,
            DELTA_PER_SECOND, GAUGE.

            Mutually exclusive with --update-stackdriver-metric.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Notes about Autoscaler.

     --max-num-replicas=MAX_NUM_REPLICAS
        Maximum number of replicas Autoscaler will set.

     --min-num-replicas=MIN_NUM_REPLICAS
        Minimum number of replicas Autoscaler will set.

     --mode=MODE
        Set the mode of an autoscaler for a managed instance group.

        You can turn off or restrict MIG autoscaler activities without
        affecting your autoscaler configuration. The autoscaler configuration
        persists while the activities are turned off or restricted, and the
        activities resume when the autoscaler is turned on again or when the
        restrictions are lifted.

        MODE must be one of:

         off
            To turn off autoscaling, while keeping the new configuration.
         on
            To permit autoscaling to scale up and down (default for new
            autoscalers).
         only-up
            To permit autoscaling to scale only up and not down.

     --queue-scaling-acceptable-backlog-per-instance=QUEUE_SCALING_ACCEPTABLE_BACKLOG_PER_INSTANCE
        Queue-based scaling target: autoscaler will aim to assure that average
        number of tasks in the queue is no greater than this value.

     --queue-scaling-cloud-pub-sub=[subscription=SUBSCRIPTION],[topic=TOPIC]
        Specifies queue-based scaling based on a Cloud Pub/Sub queuing system.
        Both topic and subscription are required.

         topic
            Topic specification. Can be just a name or a partial URL (starting
            with "projects/..."). Topic must belong to the same project as
            Autoscaler.

         subscription
            Subscription specification. Can be just a name or a partial URL
            (starting with "projects/..."). Subscription must belong to the
            same project as Autoscaler and must be connected to the specified
            topic.

     --queue-scaling-single-worker-throughput=QUEUE_SCALING_SINGLE_WORKER_THROUGHPUT
        Hint the autoscaler for queue-based scaling on how much throughput a
        single worker instance is able to consume.

     --remove-stackdriver-metric=METRIC
        Stackdriver metric to remove from autoscaling configuration. If the
        metric is the only input used for autoscaling the command will fail.

     --scale-based-on-cpu
        Autoscaler will be based on CPU utilization.

     --scale-based-on-load-balancing
        Use autoscaling based on load balancing utilization.

     --scale-in-control=[max-scaled-in-replicas=MAX-SCALED-IN-REPLICAS],[max-scaled-in-replicas-percent=MAX-SCALED-IN-REPLICAS-PERCENT],[time-window=TIME-WINDOW]
        Configuration that allows slower scale in so that even if Autoscaler
        recommends an abrupt scale in of a managed instance group, it will be
        throttled as specified by the parameters.

         max-scaled-in-replicas
            Maximum allowed number of VMs that can be deducted from the peak
            recommendation during the window. Possibly all these VMs can be
            deleted at once so the application needs to be prepared to lose
            that many VMs in one step. Mutually exclusive with
            'max-scaled-in-replicas-percent'.

         max-scaled-in-replicas-percent
            Maximum allowed percent of VMs that can be deducted from the peak
            recommendation during the window. Possibly all these VMs can be
            deleted at once so the application needs to be prepared to lose
            that many VMs in one step. Mutually exclusive with
            'max-scaled-in-replicas'.

         time-window
            How long back autoscaling should look when computing
            recommendations. The autoscaler will not resize below the maximum
            allowed deduction subtracted from the peak size observed in this
            period. Measured in seconds.

     --stackdriver-metric-filter=FILTER
        Expression for filtering samples used to autoscale, see
        https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/v3/filters.

     --stackdriver-metric-single-instance-assignment=ASSIGNMENT
        Autoscaler will aim to maintain value of metric divided by number of
        instances at this level. Mutually exclusive with
        -stackdriver-metric-utilization-target-type,
        -stackdriver-metric-utilization-target-type, and
        --custom-metric-utilization.

     --stackdriver-metric-utilization-target=TARGET
        Value of the metric Autoscaler will aim to maintain. When specifying
        this flag you must also provide
        --stackdriver-metric-utilization-target-type. Mutually exclusive with
        --stackdriver-metric-single-instance-assignment and
        --custom-metric-utilization.

     --stackdriver-metric-utilization-target-type=TARGET_TYPE
        Value of the metric Autoscaler will aim to maintain. When specifying
        this flag you must also provide
        --stackdriver-metric-utilization-target. Mutually exclusive with
        --stackdriver-metric-single-instance-assignment and
        --custom-metric-utilization. TARGET_TYPE must be one of:
        delta-per-minute, delta-per-second, gauge.

     --target-cpu-utilization=TARGET_CPU_UTILIZATION
        Autoscaler will aim to maintain CPU utilization at target level (0.0 to
        1.0).

     --target-load-balancing-utilization=TARGET_LOAD_BALANCING_UTILIZATION
        Autoscaler will aim to maintain the load balancing utilization level
        (greater than 0.0).

     --update-stackdriver-metric=METRIC
        Stackdriver metric to use as an input for autoscaling. When using this
        flag you must also specify target value of the metric by specifying
        --stackdriver-metric-single-instance-assignment or
        --stackdriver-metric-utilization-target and
        --stackdriver-metric-utilization-target-type. Mutually exclusive with
        --custom-metric-utilization.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified,
          you may be prompted to select a region.

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
          invocation.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
