DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed set-autoscaling sets
    autoscaling parameters of specified managed instance group.

    Autoscalers can use one or more policies listed below. Information on using
    multiple policies can be found here:
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/autoscaler/multiple-policies

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the managed instance group to operate on.

FLAGS
     --autoscaling-file=PATH
        Path of the file from which autoscaling configuration will be loaded.
        This flag allows you to atomically setup complex autoscalers.

     --cool-down-period=COOL_DOWN_PERIOD
        The time period that the autoscaler should wait before it starts
        collecting information from a new instance. This prevents the
        autoscaler from collecting information when the instance is
        initializing, during which the collected usage would not be reliable.
        The default is 60s. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on
        duration formats.

     --cpu-utilization-predictive-method=CPU_UTILIZATION_PREDICTIVE_METHOD
        Indicates which method of prediction is used for CPU utilization
        metric, if any. CPU_UTILIZATION_PREDICTIVE_METHOD must be one of:

         none
            (Default) No predictions are made based on the scaling metric when
            calculating the number of VM instances.
         optimize-availability
            Predictive autoscaling predicts the future values of the scaling
            metric and scales a MIG in advance to ensure that new VM instances
            are ready in time to cover the predicted peak.
         standard
            Standard predictive autoscaling predicts the future values of the
            scaling metric and then scales a MIG to ensure that new VM
            instances are ready in time to cover the predicted peak.

     --custom-metric-utilization=[metric=METRIC],[utilization-target=UTILIZATION-TARGET],[utilization-target-type=UTILIZATION-TARGET-TYPE]
        Adds a target metric value for the Autoscaler to use.

         metric
            Protocol-free URL of a Google Cloud Monitoring metric.

         utilization-target
            Value of the metric Autoscaler will aim to maintain (greater than
            0.0).

         utilization-target-type
            How target is expressed. Valid values: DELTA_PER_MINUTE,
            DELTA_PER_SECOND, GAUGE.

            Mutually exclusive with --update-stackdriver-metric.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Notes about Autoscaler.

     --max-num-replicas=MAX_NUM_REPLICAS
        Maximum number of replicas Autoscaler will set.

     --min-num-replicas=MIN_NUM_REPLICAS
        Minimum number of replicas Autoscaler will set.

     --mode=MODE
        Set the mode of an autoscaler for a managed instance group.

        You can turn off or restrict MIG autoscaler activities without
        affecting your autoscaler configuration. The autoscaler configuration
        persists while the activities are turned off or restricted, and the
        activities resume when the autoscaler is turned on again or when the
        restrictions are lifted.

        MODE must be one of:

         off
            Turns off autoscaling, while keeping the new configuration.
         on
            Permits autoscaling to scale out and in (default for new
            autoscalers).
         only-scale-out
            Permits autoscaling to scale only out and not in.
         only-up
            (DEPRECATED) Permits autoscaling to scale only out and not in.

                Value `only-up` is deprecated. Use `--mode only-scale-out`
                instead.

     --remove-stackdriver-metric=METRIC
        Stackdriver metric to remove from autoscaling configuration. If the
        metric is the only input used for autoscaling the command will fail.

     --scale-based-on-cpu
        Autoscaler will be based on CPU utilization.

     --scale-based-on-load-balancing
        Use autoscaling based on load balancing utilization.

     --scale-in-control=[max-scaled-in-replicas=MAX-SCALED-IN-REPLICAS],[max-scaled-in-replicas-percent=MAX-SCALED-IN-REPLICAS-PERCENT],[time-window=TIME-WINDOW]
        Configuration that allows slower scale in so that even if Autoscaler
        recommends an abrupt scale in of a managed instance group, it will be
        throttled as specified by the parameters.

         max-scaled-in-replicas
            Maximum allowed number of VMs that can be deducted from the peak
            recommendation during the window. Possibly all these VMs can be
            deleted at once so the application needs to be prepared to lose
            that many VMs in one step. Mutually exclusive with
            'max-scaled-in-replicas-percent'.

         max-scaled-in-replicas-percent
            Maximum allowed percent of VMs that can be deducted from the peak
            recommendation during the window. Possibly all these VMs can be
            deleted at once so the application needs to be prepared to lose
            that many VMs in one step. Mutually exclusive with
            'max-scaled-in-replicas'.

         time-window
            How long back autoscaling should look when computing
            recommendations. The autoscaler will not resize below the maximum
            allowed deduction subtracted from the peak size observed in this
            period. Measured in seconds.

     --set-schedule=SET_SCHEDULE
        A unique name of the scaling schedule.

     --stackdriver-metric-filter=FILTER
        Expression for filtering samples used to autoscale, see
        https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/v3/filters.

     --stackdriver-metric-single-instance-assignment=ASSIGNMENT
        Autoscaler will aim to maintain value of metric divided by number of
        instances at this level. Mutually exclusive with
        -stackdriver-metric-utilization-target-type,
        -stackdriver-metric-utilization-target-type, and
        --custom-metric-utilization.

     --stackdriver-metric-utilization-target=TARGET
        Value of the metric Autoscaler will aim to maintain. When specifying
        this flag you must also provide
        --stackdriver-metric-utilization-target-type. Mutually exclusive with
        --stackdriver-metric-single-instance-assignment and
        --custom-metric-utilization.

     --stackdriver-metric-utilization-target-type=TARGET_TYPE
        Value of the metric Autoscaler will aim to maintain. When specifying
        this flag you must also provide
        --stackdriver-metric-utilization-target. Mutually exclusive with
        --stackdriver-metric-single-instance-assignment and
        --custom-metric-utilization. TARGET_TYPE must be one of:
        delta-per-minute, delta-per-second, gauge.

     --target-cpu-utilization=TARGET_CPU_UTILIZATION
        Autoscaler will aim to maintain CPU utilization at target level (0.0 to
        1.0).

     --target-load-balancing-utilization=TARGET_LOAD_BALANCING_UTILIZATION
        Autoscaler will aim to maintain the load balancing utilization level
        (greater than 0.0).

     --update-stackdriver-metric=METRIC
        Stackdriver metric to use as an input for autoscaling. When using this
        flag you must also specify target value of the metric by specifying
        --stackdriver-metric-single-instance-assignment or
        --stackdriver-metric-utilization-target and
        --stackdriver-metric-utilization-target-type. Mutually exclusive with
        --custom-metric-utilization.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified,
          you may be prompted to select a region.

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified,
          you may be prompted to select a zone.

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
          invocation.

     --schedule-cron=SCHEDULE_CRON
        Start time of the scaling schedule in cron format.

        This is when an autoscaler will start creating new VMs if MIG size is
        lower than the minimum number of instances. Set the start time to allow
        enough time for new VMs to boot and initialize. For example if your
        workload takes 10 minutes from VM creation to start serving then set
        start time 10 minutes earlier than the time you need VMs to be ready.

     --schedule-description=SCHEDULE_DESCRIPTION
        A verbose description of the scaling schedule.

     --schedule-duration-sec=SCHEDULE_DURATION_SEC
        How long should the scaling schedule be active, measured in seconds.

        Minimum duration is 5 minutes. Scaling schedule is active from its
        start time and for configured duration. During this time autoscaler
        will scale MIG to have at least as many VMs as defined by the minimum
        number of instances. After specified duration if there is no need to
        maintain capacity, the autoscaler will start removing instances after a
        10 minutes stabilization period and (if configured) following scale-in
        controls.

     --schedule-min-required-replicas=SCHEDULE_MIN_REQUIRED_REPLICAS
        How many VMs autoscaler should ensure for the duration of this scaling
        schedule.

        Autoscaler will provide at least this number of instances when the
        scaling schedule is active. MIG can have more VMs if there are other
        scaling schedules active with higher instance count or if autoscaling
        policy (for example on CPU) requires more instances to meet its target.

        This configuration does not change autoscaling minimum and maximum
        instance limits which are always in effect. Autoscaler will not create
        more than the maximum number of instances configured for MIG.

     --schedule-time-zone=SCHEDULE_TIME_ZONE
        Location of the scaling schedule's start time.

        It should be provided provided as a location from the IANA tz database
        (for example Europe/Paris). It will consider daylight saving time (DST)
        adjustments. If no time zone is provided UTC is used as a default.

        See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones for
        the list of valid timezones.
