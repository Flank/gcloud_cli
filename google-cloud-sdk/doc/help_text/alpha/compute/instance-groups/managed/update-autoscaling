NAME
    gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed update-autoscaling - update
        autoscaling parameters of a managed instance group

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed update-autoscaling NAME
        [--mode=MODE]
        [--scale-down-control=[max-scaled-down-replicas=MAX-SCALED-DOWN-REPLICAS],
          [max-scaled-down-replicas-percent=MAX-SCALED-DOWN-REPLICAS-PERCENT],
          [time-window=TIME-WINDOW]] [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed update-autoscaling
    updates autoscaling parameters of specified managed instance group.

    Autoscalers can use one or more policies listed below. Information on using
    multiple policies can be found here:
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/autoscaler/multiple-policies

    In contrast to gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed
    set-autoscaling, this command only updates specified fields. For instance:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed update-autoscaling \
          --mode only-up

    would change the mode field of the autoscaler policy, but leave the rest of
    the settings intact.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the managed instance group to operate on.

FLAGS
     --mode=MODE
        Set the mode of an autoscaler for a managed instance group.

        You can turn off or restrict MIG activities without changing MIG
        configuration and then having to restore it later. MIG configuration
        persists while the activities are turned off or restricted, and the
        activities pick it up when they are turned on again or when the
        restrictions are lifted.

        MODE must be one of:

         off
            to turn off autoscaling, while keeping the new configuration.
         on
            to permit autoscaling to scale up and down (default for new
            autoscalers).
         only-down
            to permit autoscaling to scale only down and not up.
         only-up
            to permit autoscaling to scale only up and not down.

     --scale-down-control=[max-scaled-down-replicas=MAX-SCALED-DOWN-REPLICAS],[max-scaled-down-replicas-percent=MAX-SCALED-DOWN-REPLICAS-PERCENT],[time-window=TIME-WINDOW]
        Configuration that allows slower scale down so that even if Autoscaler
        recommends an abrupt scale down of a managed instance group, it will be
        throttled as specified by the parameters.

         max-scaled-down-replicas
            Maximum allowed number of VMs that can be deducted from the peak
            recommendation during the window. Possibly all these VMs can be
            deleted at once so user service needs to be prepared to lose that
            many VMs in one step. Mutually exclusive with
            'max-scaled-down-replicas-percent'.

         max-scaled-down-replicas-percent
            Maximum allowed percent of VMs that can be deducted from the peak
            recommendation during the window. Possibly all these VMs can be
            deleted at once so user service needs to be prepared to lose that
            many VMs in one step. Mutually exclusive with
            'max-scaled-down-replicas'.

         time-window
            How long back autoscaling should look when computing
            recommendations to include directives regarding slower scale down.
            Measured in seconds.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified,
          you may be prompted to select a region.

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified,
          you may be prompted to select a zone.

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
          invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access whitelist.
