NAME
    gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed create-instance - create a new
        virtual machine instance in a managed instance group with a defined
        name and optionally its stateful configuration: stateful disk, stateful
        metadata

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed create-instance NAME
        --instance=INSTANCE
        [--stateful-disk=[auto-delete=AUTO-DELETE],
          [device-name=DEVICE-NAME],[mode=MODE],[source=SOURCE]]
        [--stateful-metadata=KEY=VALUE,[KEY=VALUE,...]]
        [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed create-instance
    creates a virtual machine instance with a defined name and optionally its
    stateful configuration: stateful disk and stateful metadata key-values.
    Stateful configuration is stored in the corresponding newly created
    per-instance config. An instance with a per-instance config will preserve
    its given name, specified disks, and metadata key-values during instance
    recreation, auto-healing, and updates and any other lifecycle transitions
    of the instance.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the managed instance group to create instance in.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --instance=INSTANCE
        Name of the new instance to create.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --stateful-disk=[auto-delete=AUTO-DELETE],[device-name=DEVICE-NAME],[mode=MODE],[source=SOURCE]
        Stateful disk for the managed instance group to preserve. Usually, a
        managed instance group deletes disks when deleting instances; however,
        stateful disks are detached from deleted instances and are reattached
        automatically to the instance on recreation, autohealing, updates, and
        any other lifecycle transitions of the instance.

        Stateful disks specified here form part of the per-instance config for
        the new instance.

        The same disk can be attached to many instances but only in read-only
        mode.

        Use this flag multiple times to attach more disks.

         device-name
            (Required) Device name under which disk is or will be attached.

         source
            (Required) URI of an existing persistent disk to attach under the
            specified device-name.

         mode
            Specifies the attachment mode of the disk. Supported options are
            'ro' for read-only and 'rw' for read-write. If omitted, defaults to
            'rw'. mode can only be specified if source is given.

         auto-delete
            (Optional) Specifies the auto deletion policy of the stateful disk.
            Supported values are 'never' (never delete this disk) and
            'on-permanent-instance-deletion' (delete the stateful disk when the
            given instance is permanently deleted from the instance group; for
            example when the group is resized down). If omitted, 'never' is
            used as the default.

     --stateful-metadata=KEY=VALUE,[KEY=VALUE,...]
        Additional metadata to be made available to the guest operating system
        on the instance along with the metadata defined in the instance
        template.

        Use stateful metadata to define key/value pairs specific to an instance
        to differentiate it from other instances in the managed instance group.
        The stateful metadata forms part of the per-instance config for the new
        instance.

        Stateful metadata key/value pairs are preserved on instance recreation,
        autohealing, updates, and any other lifecycle transitions of the
        instance.

        Only metadata keys provided in this flag are mutated. Stateful metadata
        values defined for the keys already existing in the instance template
        override the values from the instance template. Other metadata entries
        from the instance template will remain unaffected and available.

        Each metadata entry is a key/value pair separated by an equals sign.
        Metadata keys must be unique and less than 128 bytes in length.
        Multiple entries can be passed to this flag, e.g., --stateful-metadata
        key-1=value-1,key-2=value-2,key-3=value-3.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the managed instance group to create instance in. If not
          specified, you may be prompted to select a region.

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the managed instance group to create instance in. If not
          specified, you may be prompted to select a zone.

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
          invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access whitelist.
