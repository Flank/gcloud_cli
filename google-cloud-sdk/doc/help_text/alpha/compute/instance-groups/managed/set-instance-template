DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed set-instance-template
    sets the instance template for an existing managed instance group.

    The new template applies to all new instances added to the managed instance
    group.

    To apply the new template to existing instances in the group, use one of
    the following methods:

      o Update instances using the update-instances command.
      o Recreate instances using the recreate-instances command.
      o Use the rolling-action start-update command.
      o Use the API to set the group's updatePolicy.type to PROACTIVE.
