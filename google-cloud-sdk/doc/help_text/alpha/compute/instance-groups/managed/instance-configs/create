          default="none"]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed instance-configs
    create creates a per-instance config for an instance controlled by a
    Compute Engine managed instance group. An instance with a per instance
    config preserves the specified metadata and/or disks during instance
    recreation and deletion.

    Once created, the config is applied immediately to the corresponding
    instance, by performing the necessary action (for example, REFRESH), unless
    overridden by providing the --no-update-instance flag.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the managed instance group to create a per instance config for.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --instance=INSTANCE
        URI/name of an existing instance in the managed instance group.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --instance-update-minimal-action=INSTANCE_UPDATE_MINIMAL_ACTION; default="none"
        Perform at least this action on the instance while updating, if
        --update-instance is set to true. INSTANCE_UPDATE_MINIMAL_ACTION must
        be one of:

         none
            No action
         refresh
            Apply properties that are possible to apply without stopping the
            instance
         replace
            Delete the instance and create it again
         restart
            Stop the instance and start it again

     --stateful-disk=[auto-delete=AUTO-DELETE],[device-name=DEVICE-NAME],[mode=MODE],[source=SOURCE]
        Disks considered stateful by the instance group. Managed instance
        groups preserve and reattach stateful disks on VM autohealing, update,
        and recreate events.

        You can also attach and preserve disks, not defined in the group's
        instance template, to a given instance.

        The same disk can be attached to more than one instance but only in
        read-only mode.

            Use this argument multiple times to attach and preserve multiple disks.

         device-name
            Name under which disk is or will be attached.

         source
            Optional argument used to specify the URI of an existing persistent
            disk to attach under specified device-name.

         mode
            Specifies the mode of the disk to attach. Supported options are ro
            for read-only and rw for read-write. If omitted when source is
            specified, rw is used as a default. mode can only be specified if
            source is given.

         auto-delete
            (Optional) Specifies the auto deletion policy of the stateful disk.
            Supported values are never (never delete this disk) and
            on-permanent-instance-deletion (delete the stateful disk when the
            given instance is permanently deleted from the instance group; for
            example when the group is resized down). If omitted, never is used
            as the default.

     --stateful-metadata=KEY=VALUE,[KEY=VALUE,...]
        Additional metadata to be made available to the guest operating system
        in addition to the metadata defined in the instance template.

        Stateful metadata may be used to define a key/value pair specific for
        the one given instance to differentiate it from the other instances in
        the managed instance group.

        Stateful metadata key/value pairs are preserved on instance recreation,
        autohealing, updates, and any other lifecycle transitions of the
        instance.

        Stateful metadata have priority over the metadata defined in the
        instance template. This means that stateful metadata that is defined
        for a key that already exists in the instance template overrides the
        instance template value.

        Each metadata entry is a key/value pair separated by an equals sign.
        Metadata keys must be unique and less than 128 bytes in length.
        Multiple entries can be passed to this flag, e.g., --stateful-metadata
        key-1=value-1,key-2=value-2,key-3=value-3.

     --update-instance
        Apply the configuration changes immediately to the instance. If you
        disable this flag, the managed instance group will apply the config
        update when you next recreate or update the instance.

        Example: say you have an instance with a disk attached to it and you
        created a stateful config for the disk. If you decide to delete the
        stateful config for the disk and you provide this flag, the MIG
        immediately refreshes the instance and removes the stateful config for
        the disk. Similarly if you have attached a new disk or changed its
        definition, with this flag the MIG immediately refreshes the instance
        with the new config.

        Enabled by default, use --no-update-instance to disable.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the managed instance group to create a per instance config
          for. If not specified, you may be prompted to select a region.

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the managed instance group to create a per instance config
          for. If not specified, you may be prompted to select a zone.

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
          invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To create a per-instance config with a stateful disk my-disk and to add
    stateful metadata my-key:my-value, on instance my-instance, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed instance-configs \
            create my-group --region=europe-west4 --instance=my-instance \
            --stateful-disk=device-name=my-disk,source=projects/my-project/\
        zones/us-central1-a/disks/my-disk-3 \
            --stateful-metadata="my-key=my-value"

    If my-disk did not exist previously in the per instance config, and if it
    does not exist in the group's instance template, then the command adds
    my-disk to my-instance.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access whitelist. This variant is also available:
