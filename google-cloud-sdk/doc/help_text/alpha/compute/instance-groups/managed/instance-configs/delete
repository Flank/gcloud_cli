NAME
    gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed instance-configs delete -
        delete per instance configs from managed instance group

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed instance-configs delete NAME
        --instances=INSTANCE,[INSTANCE,...] [--force-instance-update]
        [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed instance-configs
    delete deletes one or more per instance configs from a Google Compute
    Engine managed instance group.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        The name of the managed instance group to delete.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --instances=INSTANCE,[INSTANCE,...]
        Names of instances to delete instance-configs from.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --force-instance-update
        The changes will be applied immediately to the instances. If this flag
        is not provided, the changes will be applied once the instances are
        restarted or recreated.

        Example: let's say we have an instance with a disk attached to it and
        an override for the disk. If we decide to delete the override and
        provide this flag, this will instantly recreate the instance and detach
        the disk from it. Similarly if we have attached new disk or changed its
        definition - with this flag it will instantly recreate instance with
        newly applied overrides.

        If we omit this flag, the instance will continue to exist with no
        overrides changes applied until it gets restarted or recreated either
        manually or by autohealer or updater.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --region=REGION
          The region of the managed instance group to delete. If not specified,
          you may be prompted to select a region.

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          The zone of the managed instance group to delete. If not specified,
          you may be prompted to select a zone.

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
          invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. Usually,
    users of ALPHA commands and flags need to apply for access, agree to
    applicable terms, and have their projects whitelisted. Contact Google or
