DESCRIPTION

    start-update updates instances in a managed instance group, according to
    the given versions and the given update policy.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the managed instance group to operate on.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --version=[template=TEMPLATE,[name=NAME],...]
        Original instance template resource to be used. Each version has the
        following format: template=TEMPLATE,[name=NAME]

COMMONLY USED FLAGS
     --canary-version=[template=TEMPLATE,target-size=FIXED_OR_PERCENT,[name=NAME],...]
        New instance template resource to be used. Each version has the
        following format:
        template=TEMPLATE,target-size=FIXED_OR_PERCENT,[name=NAME]

     --type=TYPE; default="proactive"
        Desired update type. TYPE must be one of:

         opportunistic
            Do not proactively replace instances. Create new instances and
            delete old on resizes of the group.
         proactive
            Replace instances proactively.

OTHER FLAGS
     --force
        If set, accepts any original or new version configurations without
        validation.

     --max-surge=MAX_SURGE
        Maximum additional number of instances that can be created during the
        update process. This can be a fixed number (e.g. 5) or a percentage of
        size to the managed instance group (e.g. 10%)

     --max-unavailable=MAX_UNAVAILABLE
        Maximum number of instances that can be unavailable during the update
        process. This can be a fixed number (e.g. 5) or a percentage of size to
        the managed instance group (e.g. 10%)

     --min-ready=MIN_READY
        Minimum time for which a newly created instance should be ready to be
        considered available. For example 10s for 10 seconds. See $ gcloud
        topic datetimes for information on duration formats.

     --replacement-method=REPLACEMENT_METHOD
        Type of replacement method. Specifies what action will be taken to
        update instances. REPLACEMENT_METHOD must be one of:

         recreate
            Updated instances will be recreated with the same name.
         substitute
            Updated instances will be deleted and created again with another
            name.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified,
          you may be prompted to select a region.

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified,
          you may be prompted to select a zone.

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
          invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute instance-groups managed rolling-action start-update
        $ gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed rolling-action \
            start-update
