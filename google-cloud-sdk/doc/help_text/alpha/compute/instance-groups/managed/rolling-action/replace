NAME
    gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed rolling-action replace -
        replaces instances in a managed instance group

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed rolling-action replace NAME
        [--max-surge=MAX_SURGE] [--max-unavailable=MAX_UNAVAILABLE]
        [--min-ready=MIN_READY] [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Deletes the existing instance and creates a new instance from the
    target template. The Updater creates a brand new instance with all new
    instance properties, such as new internal and external IP addresses.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the managed instance group to operate on.

FLAGS
     --max-surge=MAX_SURGE
        Maximum additional number of instances that can be created during the
        update process. This can be a fixed number (e.g. 5) or a percentage of
        size to the managed instance group (e.g. 10%)

     --max-unavailable=MAX_UNAVAILABLE
        Maximum number of instances that can be unavailable during the update
        process. This can be a fixed number (e.g. 5) or a percentage of size to
        the managed instance group (e.g. 10%)

     --min-ready=MIN_READY
        Minimum time for which a newly created instance should be ready to be
        considered available. For example 10s for 10 seconds. See $ gcloud
        topic datetimes for information on duration formats.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified,
          you may be prompted to select a region.

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified,
          you may be prompted to select a zone.

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
          invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
    https://cloud.google.com/support/. This variant is also available:
