DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Update a Compute Engine managed instance group.

    gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed update allows you to specify
    or modify the stateful policy and autohealing policy for an existing
    managed instance group.

    A stateful policy defines which resources should be preserved across the
    group. When instances in the group are recreated, stateful resources are
    preserved. This command allows you to update stateful resources,
    specifically to add or remove stateful disks.

    When updating the autohealing policy, you can specify the health check,
    initial delay, or both. If either field is unspecified, its value won't be
    modified. If --health-check is specified, the health check monitors the
    health of your application. Whenever the health check signal for an
    instance becomes UNHEALTHY, the autohealer recreates the instance.

    If no health check exists, instance autohealing is triggered only by
    instance status: if an instance is not RUNNING, the group recreates it.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the managed instance group to update.

FLAGS
     --instance-redistribution-type=TYPE
        Specifies the type of the instance redistribution policy. An instance
        redistribution type lets you enable or disable automatic instance
        redistribution across zones to meet the target distribution. The target
        distribution is a state of a regional managed instance group where all
        instances are spread out evenly across all target zones.

        An instance redistribution type can be specified only for a
        non-autoscaled regional managed instance group. By default it is set to
        PROACTIVE.

        The following types are available:

        * NONE - The managed instance group does not redistribute instances
          across zones.

        * PROACTIVE - The managed instance group proactively redistributes
          instances to meet its target distribution.

    TYPE must be one of: NONE, PROACTIVE.

     --remove-stateful-disks=DEVICE_NAME,[DEVICE_NAME,...]
        Stop considering the disks stateful by the instance group.

     --stateful-disk=[auto-delete=AUTO-DELETE],[device-name=DEVICE-NAME]
        Disks considered stateful by the instance group. Managed instance
        groups preserve and reattach stateful disks on VM autohealing, update,
        and recreate events.

        Use this argument multiple times to update more disks.

        If a stateful disk with the given device name already exists in the
        current instance config, its properties will be replaced by the newly
        provided ones. Otherwise, a new stateful disk definition will be added
        to the instance config.

         device-name
            (Requied) Device name of the disk to mark stateful.

         auto-delete
            (Optional) Specifies the auto deletion policy of the stateful disk.
            Supported values are never (never delete this disk) and
            on-permanent-instance-deletion (delete the stateful disk when the
            given instance is permanently deleted from the instance group; for
            example when the group is resized down). If omitted, never is used
            as the default.

     --target-distribution-shape=SHAPE
        Specifies how a regional managed instance group distributes its
        instances across zones within the region.

        The following target shape are available:

        * EVEN ‒ The group schedules VM instance creation and deletion in a
          way that maintains an even number of managed instances across the
          selected zones. Recommended for highly available serving workloads.
        * BALANCED ‒ The group prioritizes acquisition of resources -
          scheduling VMs in zones where resources are available - while
          distributing VMs as evenly as possible across selected zones to
          minimize the impact of zone-level failure. Recommended for highly
          available serving or batch workloads that do not require autoscaling.
        * ANY ‒ The group picks zones for creating VM instances to fulfill
          the requested number of VMs within present capacity constraints.
          Recommended for batch workloads that do not require high
          availability.

    SHAPE must be one of: EVEN, ANY, BALANCED.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --clear-autohealing
          Clears all autohealing policy fields for the managed instance group.

       --initial-delay=INITIAL_DELAY
          Specifies the length of time during which the instance is known to be
          initializing and should not be autohealed even if unhealthy. This
          value cannot be greater than 1 hour. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for
          information on duration formats.

       At most one of these may be specified:

         --health-check=HEALTH_CHECK
            Name of the health check to operate on.

         --http-health-check=HTTP_HEALTH_CHECK
            (DEPRECATED) HTTP health check object used for autohealing
            instances in this group.

            HttpHealthCheck is deprecated. Use --health-check instead.

         --https-health-check=HTTPS_HEALTH_CHECK
            (DEPRECATED) HTTPS health check object used for autohealing
            instances in this group.

            HttpsHealthCheck is deprecated. Use --health-check instead.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the managed instance group to update. If not specified, you
          may be prompted to select a region.

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the managed instance group to update. If not specified, you
          may be prompted to select a zone.

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
          invocation.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute instance-groups managed update
        $ gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed update
