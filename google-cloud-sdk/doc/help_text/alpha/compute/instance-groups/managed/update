NAME
    gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed update - update Google Compute
        Engine managed instance groups

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed update NAME
        [--add-stateful-disks=DEVICE_NAME,[DEVICE_NAME,...]]
        [--remove-stateful-disks=DEVICE_NAME,[DEVICE_NAME,...]]
        [--stateful-names] [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed update allows to
    update StatefulPolicy for a managed instance group. Stateful Policy defines
    what stateful resources should be preserved for the group. When instances
    in the group are removed or recreated, those stateful properties are always
    applied to them. This command allows to change the preserved resources by
    adding more disks or removing existing disks and to turn on and off
    preserving instance names.

    Example:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed update \
            example-group --add-stateful-disks my-disk-1,my-disk-2 \
        --remove-stateful-disks my-disk-0

    will for each instance mark disk my-disk-0 as not stateful and disks
    my-disk-1 and my-disk-2 as stateful. That means that disks my-disk-1 and
    my-disk-2 will be preserved when the instances get recreated or restarted,
    while disk my-disk-0 will not be preserved anymore.

    When there are any disks marked as stateful, the instances automatically
    will be assigned stateful names as well. You cannot turn off stateful names
    without marking all disks as non-stateful.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        The name of the managed instance group to update.

FLAGS
     --add-stateful-disks=DEVICE_NAME,[DEVICE_NAME,...]
        Add more disks to be considered stateful by the instance group.
        Usually, the managed instance group deletes disks when deleting
        instances; however, in the case of stateful disks, these disks are
        detached from the deleted instance and attached to new instances the
        managed instance group creates.

     --remove-stateful-disks=DEVICE_NAME,[DEVICE_NAME,...]
        Stop considering the disks stateful by the instance group.

     --stateful-names
        Enable stateful names of instances. Whenever instances with those names
        are restarted or recreated, they will have the same names as before.
        Use --no-stateful-names to disable stateful names.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --region=REGION
          The region of the managed instance group to update. If not specified,
          you will be prompted to select a region.

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          The zone of the managed instance group to update. If not specified,
          you may be prompted to select a zone.

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
          invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. Usually,
    users of ALPHA commands and flags need to apply for access, agree to
    applicable terms, and have their projects whitelisted. Contact Google or
