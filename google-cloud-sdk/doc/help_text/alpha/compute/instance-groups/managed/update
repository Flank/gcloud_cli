DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed update allows you to
    specify or modify the StatefulPolicy and AutoHealingPolicy for an existing
    managed instance group.

    Stateful Policy defines what stateful resources should be preserved for the
    group. When instances in the group are removed or recreated, those stateful
    properties are always applied to them. This command allows you to change
    the preserved resources by adding more disks or removing existing disks and
    allows you to turn on and off preserving instance names.

    When updating the AutoHealingPolicy, you may specify the health check,
    initial delay, or both. If the field is unspecified, its value won't be
    modified. If --health-check is specified, the health check will be used to
    monitor the health of your application. Whenever the health check signal
    for the instance becomes UNHEALTHY, the autohealing action (RECREATE) on an
    instance will be performed.

    If no health check is specified, the instance autohealing will be triggered
    by the instance status only (i.e. the autohealing action (RECREATE) on an
    instance will be performed if instance.status is not RUNNING).

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the managed instance group to update.

FLAGS
     --instance-redistribution-type=TYPE
        Specify type of instance redistribution policy. Instance redistribution
        type gives possibility to enable or disable automatic instance
        redistribution between zones to its target distribution. Target
        distribution is a state of regional managed instance group where all
        instances are spread out equally between all target zones.

        Instance redistribution type may be specified for non-autoscaled
        regional managed instance group only. By default it is set to
        PROACTIVE.

        The following types are available:

        * NONE - managed instance group will not take any action to bring
          instances to its target distribution.

        * PROACTIVE - managed instance group will actively converge all
          instances between zones to its target distribution.

    TYPE must be one of: NONE, PROACTIVE.

     --remove-stateful-disks=DEVICE_NAME,[DEVICE_NAME,...]
        Stop considering the disks stateful by the instance group.

     --stateful-names
        Enable stateful names of instances. Whenever instances with those names
        are restarted or recreated, they will have the same names as before.
        Use --no-stateful-names to disable stateful names.

     --update-stateful-disk=[auto-delete=AUTO-DELETE],[device-name=DEVICE-NAME]
        Disks considered stateful by the instance group. Usually, the managed
        instance group deletes disks when deleting instances; however, in the
        case of stateful disks, these disks are detached from the deleted
        instance and attached to new instances the managed instance group
        creates.

        Use this argument multiple times to update more disks.

        If stateful disk with given device-name exists in current instance
        config, its properties will be replaced by the newly provided ones. In
        other case new stateful disk definition will be added to the instance
        config.

         device-name
            (Requied) Device name of the disk to mark stateful.

         auto-delete
            (Optional) Specifies the auto deletion policy of the stateful disk.
            Supported values are 'never' (never delete this disk) and
            'on-permanent-instance-deletion' (delete the stateful disk when the
            given instance is permanently deleted from the instance group; for
            example when the group is resized down). If omitted, 'never' is
            used as the default.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --clear-autohealing
          Clears all autohealing policy fields for the managed instance group.

       --initial-delay=INITIAL_DELAY
          Specifies the length of time during which the instance is known to be
          initializing and should not be autohealed even if unhealthy. This
          value cannot be greater than 1 hour. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for
          information on duration formats.

       At most one of these may be specified:

         --health-check=HEALTH_CHECK
            Name of the health check to operate on.

         --http-health-check=HTTP_HEALTH_CHECK
            (DEPRECATED) HTTP health check object used for autohealing
            instances in this group.

            HttpHealthCheck is deprecated. Use --health-check instead.

         --https-health-check=HTTPS_HEALTH_CHECK
            (DEPRECATED) HTTPS health check object used for autohealing
            instances in this group.

            HttpsHealthCheck is deprecated. Use --health-check instead.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the managed instance group to update. If not specified, you
          may be prompted to select a region.

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the managed instance group to update. If not specified, you
          may be prompted to select a zone.

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
          invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
    https://cloud.google.com/support/. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute instance-groups managed update
        $ gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed update
