NAME
    gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed update - update Google Compute
        Engine managed instance groups

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed update NAME
        [--add-stateful-disks=DEVICE_NAME,[DEVICE_NAME,...]]
        [--instance-redistribution-type=TYPE]
        [--remove-stateful-disks=DEVICE_NAME,[DEVICE_NAME,...]]
        [--stateful-names] [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed update allows to
    update StatefulPolicy for a managed instance group. Stateful Policy defines
    what stateful resources should be preserved for the group. When instances
    in the group are removed or recreated, those stateful properties are always
    applied to them. This command allows to change the preserved resources by
    adding more disks or removing existing disks and to turn on and off
    preserving instance names.

    Example:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed update \
            example-group --add-stateful-disks my-disk-1,my-disk-2 \
        --remove-stateful-disks my-disk-0

    will for each instance mark disk my-disk-0 as not stateful and disks
    my-disk-1 and my-disk-2 as stateful. That means that disks my-disk-1 and
    my-disk-2 will be preserved when the instances get recreated or restarted,
    while disk my-disk-0 will not be preserved anymore.

    When there are any disks marked as stateful, the instances automatically
    will be assigned stateful names as well. You cannot turn off stateful names
    without marking all disks as non-stateful.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the managed instance group to update.

FLAGS
     --add-stateful-disks=DEVICE_NAME,[DEVICE_NAME,...]
        Add more disks to be considered stateful by the instance group.
        Usually, the managed instance group deletes disks when deleting
        instances; however, in the case of stateful disks, these disks are
        detached from the deleted instance and attached to new instances the
        managed instance group creates.

     --instance-redistribution-type=TYPE
        Specify type of instance redistribution policy. Instance redistribution
        type gives possibility to enable or disable automatic instance
        redistribution between zones to its target distribution. Target
        distribution is a state of regional managed instance group where all
        instances are spread out equally between all target zones.

        Instance redistribution type may be specified for non-autoscaled
        regional managed instance group only. By default it is set to
        PROACTIVE.

        The following types are available:

        * NONE - managed instance group will not take any action to bring
          instances to its target distribution.

        * PROACTIVE - managed instance group will actively converge all
          instances between zones to its target distribution.

    TYPE must be one of: NONE, PROACTIVE.

     --remove-stateful-disks=DEVICE_NAME,[DEVICE_NAME,...]
        Stop considering the disks stateful by the instance group.

     --stateful-names
        Enable stateful names of instances. Whenever instances with those names
        are restarted or recreated, they will have the same names as before.
        Use --no-stateful-names to disable stateful names.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the managed instance group to update. If not specified, you
          may be prompted to select a region.

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the managed instance group to update. If not specified, you
          may be prompted to select a zone.

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
          invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
