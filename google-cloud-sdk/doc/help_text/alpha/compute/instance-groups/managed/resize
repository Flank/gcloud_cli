NAME
    gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed resize - set managed instance
        group size

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed resize NAME --size=SIZE
        [--no-creation-retries] [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed resize resize a
    managed instance group to a provided size.

    If you resize down, the Instance Group Manager service deletes instances
    from the group until the group reaches the desired size. To understand in
    what order instances will be deleted, see the API documentation.

    If you resize up, the service adds instances to the group using the current
    instance template until the group reaches the desired size.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the managed instance group to operate on.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --size=SIZE
        Target number of instances in managed instance group.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --creation-retries
        When instance creation fails retry it. Enabled by default, use
        --no-creation-retries to disable.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified,
          you may be prompted to select a region.

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified,
          you may be prompted to select a zone.

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
          invocation.
