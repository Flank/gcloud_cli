NAME
    gcloud alpha compute instance-groups set-named-ports - sets the list of
        named ports for an instance group

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute instance-groups set-named-ports NAME
        --named-ports=[NAME:PORT,...] [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Named ports are key:value pairs metadata representing the service
    name and the port that it's running on. Named ports can be assigned to an
    instance group, which indicates that the service is available on all
    instances in the group. This information is used by the HTTP Load Balancing
    service.

    gcloud alpha compute instance-groups set-named-ports sets the list of named
    ports for all instances in an instance group.

    Note: Running this command will clear all existing named ports.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the instance group to operate on.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --named-ports=[NAME:PORT,...]
        The comma-separated list of key:value pairs representing the service
        name and the port that it is running on.

        To clear the list of named ports pass empty list as flag value. For
        example:

            $ gcloud alpha compute instance-groups set-named-ports \
                example-instance-group --named-ports ""

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     At most one of these may be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the instance group to operate on. If not specified, you may
          be prompted to select a region.

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the instance group to operate on. If not specified, you may
          be prompted to select a zone.

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
          invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    For example, to apply the named ports to an entire instance group:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instance-groups set-named-ports \
            example-instance-group --named-ports example-service:1111 \
            --zone us-central1-a

    The above example will assign a name 'example-service' for port 1111 to the
    instance group called 'example-instance-group' in the us-central1-a zone.
    The command removes any named ports that are already set for this instance
    group.

    To clear named ports from instance group provide empty named ports list as
    parameter:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instance-groups set-named-ports \
            example-instance-group --named-ports "" --zone us-central1-a

    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
