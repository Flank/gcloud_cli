NAME
    gcloud alpha compute instance-groups unmanaged create - create a Compute
        Engine unmanaged instance group

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute instance-groups unmanaged create NAME
        [--description=DESCRIPTION] [--zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute instance-groups unmanaged create creates a new
    Google Compute Engine unmanaged instance group. For example:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instance-groups unmanaged create \
            example-instance-group --zone us-central1-a

    The above example creates one unmanaged instance group called
    'example-instance-group' in the us-central1-a zone.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        The name of the instance group to create.

FLAGS
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Specifies a textual description for the unmanaged instance group.

     --zone=ZONE
        The zone of the instance group to create. If not specified and the
        compute/zone property isn't set, you may be prompted to select a zone.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.
