NAME
    gcloud alpha compute ssl-certificates delete - delete Compute Engine SSL
        certificates

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute ssl-certificates delete NAME [NAME ...]
        [--global | --region=REGION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute ssl-certificates delete deletes one or more
    Compute Engine SSL certificates. SSL certificates can only be deleted when
    no other resources (for example, target HTTPS proxies) refer to them.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME [NAME ...]
        Names of the SSL certificates to delete.

FLAGS
     At most one of these may be specified:

       --global
          If set, the SSL certificates are global.

       --region=REGION
          Region of the SSL certificates to delete. If not specified, you may
          be prompted to select a region.

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/region property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/region

          Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To delete a certificate 'my-cert', run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute ssl-certificates delete my-cert

    To delete certificates 'my-cert1', 'my-cert2' and 'my-cert3', run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute ssl-certificates delete my-cert1 my-cert2 \
          my-cert3

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute ssl-certificates delete
        $ gcloud beta compute ssl-certificates delete
