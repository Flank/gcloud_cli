NAME
    gcloud alpha compute snapshots remove-iam-policy-binding - remove IAM
        policy binding of a Google Compute Engine snapshot

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute snapshots remove-iam-policy-binding SNAPSHOT_NAME
        --member=MEMBER --role=ROLE
        [--all | --condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          | --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Remove an IAM policy binding from the IAM policy of a Google
    Compute Engine snapshot. One binding consists of a member, a role, and an
    optional condition.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Snapshot resource - The snapshot for which to remove IAM policy binding
     from. This represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not
     given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the
     [project] attribute: provide the argument [snapshot_name] on the command
     line with a fully specified name; set the property [core/project]; provide
     the argument [--project] on the command line. This must be specified.

       SNAPSHOT_NAME
          ID of the snapshot or fully qualified identifier for the snapshot.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --member=MEMBER
        The member to remove the binding for. Should be of the form
        user|group|serviceAccount:email or domain:domain.

        Examples: user:test-user@gmail.com, group:admins@example.com,
        serviceAccount:test123@example.domain.com, or
        domain:example.domain.com.

        Can also be one of the following special values:
        * allUsers - anyone who is on the internet, with or without a Google
          account.
        * allAuthenticatedUsers - anyone who is authenticated with a Google
          account or a service account.

     --role=ROLE
        The role to remove the member from.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     At most one of these may be specified:

       --all
          Remove all bindings with this role and member, irrespective of any
          conditions.

       --condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          Condition of the binding to be removed. When condition is explicitly
          specified as None (e.g. --condition=None), it matches a binding
          without a condition. Otherwise, only the binding with a condition
          which exactly matches the specified condition (including the optional
          description) will be removed.

       expression
          (Required) Expression of the condition which evaluates to True or
          False. This uses a subset of Common Expression Language syntax.

       title
          (Required) Title for the expression, i.e. a short string describing
          its purpose.

       description
          (Optional) Description for the expression. This is a longer text
          which describes the expression.

          NOTE: An unsatisfied condition will not allow access via this
          binding.

       --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE
          Path to a local JSON or YAML file that defines the condition. To see
          available fields, see the help for --condition.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the compute/alpha API. The full documentation for this
    API can be found at:

EXAMPLES
    To remove an IAM policy binding for the role of
    'roles/compute.securityAdmin' for the user 'test-user@gmail.com' with
    snapshot 'my-snapshot', run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute snapshots remove-iam-policy-binding \
            my-snapshot --member='user:test-user@gmail.com' \
            --role='roles/compute.securityAdmin'

    To remove an IAM policy binding which expires at the end of the year 2018
    for the role of 'roles/compute.securityAdmin' and the user
    'test-user@gmail.com' with snapshot 'my-snapshot', run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute snapshots remove-iam-policy-binding \
            my-snapshot --member='user:test-user@gmail.com' \
            --role='roles/compute.securityAdmin' \
            --condition='expression=request.time <
         timestamp("2019-01-01T00:00:00Z"),title=expires_end_of_2018,descrip\
        tion=Expires at midnight on 2018-12-31'
