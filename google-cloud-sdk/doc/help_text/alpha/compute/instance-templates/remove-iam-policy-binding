NAME
    gcloud alpha compute instance-templates remove-iam-policy-binding - remove
        IAM policy binding from a Google Compute Engine instance template

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute instance-templates remove-iam-policy-binding
        INSTANCE_TEMPLATE --member=MEMBER --role=ROLE
        [--all | --condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          | --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Remove an IAM policy binding from the IAM policy of a Google
    Compute Engine instance template. One binding consists of a member, a role,
    and an optional condition.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Instance template resource - The instance template for which to remove IAM
     policy binding from. This represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some
     attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other
     ways. To set the [project] attribute: provide the argument
     [instance_template] on the command line with a fully specified name; set
     the property [core/project]; provide the argument [--project] on the
     command line. This must be specified.

       INSTANCE_TEMPLATE
          ID of the instance_template or fully qualified identifier for the
          instance_template.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --member=MEMBER
        The member to remove the binding for. Should be of the form
        user|group|serviceAccount:email or domain:domain.

        Examples: user:test-user@gmail.com, group:admins@example.com,
        serviceAccount:test123@example.domain.com, or
        domain:example.domain.com.

        Can also be one of the following special values:
        * allUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone who is on the
          internet, with or without a Google account.
        * allAuthenticatedUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone
          who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account.

     --role=ROLE
        The role to remove the member from.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     At most one of these may be specified:

       --all
          Remove all bindings with this role and member, irrespective of any
          conditions.

       --condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          Condition of the binding to be removed. When condition is explicitly
          specified as None (e.g. --condition=None), it matches a binding
          without a condition. Otherwise, only the binding with a condition
          which exactly matches the specified condition (including the optional
          description) will be removed.

       expression
          (Required) Expression of the condition which evaluates to True or
          False. This uses a subset of Common Expression Language syntax.

       title
          (Required) Title for the expression, i.e. a short string describing
          its purpose.

       description
          (Optional) Description for the expression. This is a longer text
          which describes the expression.

          NOTE: An unsatisfied condition will not allow access via this
          binding.

       --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE
          Path to a local JSON or YAML file that defines the condition. To see
          available fields, see the help for --condition.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

EXAMPLES
    To remove an IAM policy binding for the role of 'roles/compute.admin' for
    the user 'test-user@gmail.com' with instance template 'my-template', run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instance-templates \
            remove-iam-policy-binding my-template \
            --member='user:test-user@gmail.com' --role='roles/compute.admin'

    To remove an IAM policy binding which expires at the end of the year 2018
    for the role of 'roles/compute.admin' and the user 'test-user@gmail.com'
    with instance template 'my-template', run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instance-templates \
            remove-iam-policy-binding my-template \
            --member='user:test-user@gmail.com' \
            --role='roles/compute.admin' \
            --condition='expression=request.time <
         timestamp("2019-01-01T00:00:00Z"),title=expires_end_of_2018,descrip\
        tion=Expires at midnight on 2018-12-31'
