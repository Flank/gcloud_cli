NAME
    gcloud alpha compute instance-templates add-iam-policy-binding - add IAM
        policy binding to a Compute Engine instance template

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute instance-templates add-iam-policy-binding
        INSTANCE_TEMPLATE --member=MEMBER --role=ROLE
        [--condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          | --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Add an IAM policy binding to the IAM policy of a Compute Engine
    instance template. One binding consists of a member, a role, and an
    optional condition.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Instance template resource - The instance template for which to add IAM
     policy binding to. This represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some
     attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other
     ways. To set the [project] attribute: provide the argument
     [instance_template] on the command line with a fully specified name; set
     the property [core/project]; provide the argument [--project] on the
     command line. This must be specified.

       INSTANCE_TEMPLATE
          ID of the instance_template or fully qualified identifier for the
          instance_template.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --member=MEMBER
        The member to add the binding for. Should be of the form
        user|group|serviceAccount:email or domain:domain.

        Examples: user:test-user@gmail.com, group:admins@example.com,
        serviceAccount:test123@example.domain.com, or
        domain:example.domain.com.

        Can also be one of the following special values:
        * allUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone who is on the
          internet, with or without a Google account.
        * allAuthenticatedUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone
          who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account.

     --role=ROLE
        Define the role of the member.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     At most one of these may be specified:

       --condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          The condition of the binding to be added. When the condition is
          explicitly specified as None (--condition=None), a binding without a
          condition is added. When the condition is specified and is not None,
          --role cannot be a primitive role. Primitive roles are roles/editor,
          roles/owner, and roles/viewer.

       expression
          (Required) Expression of the condition which evaluates to True or
          False. This uses a subset of Common Expression Language syntax.

       title
          (Required) A short string describing the purpose of the expression.

       description
          (Optional) Additional description for the expression.

          NOTE: An unsatisfied condition will not allow access via this
          binding.

       --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE
          Path to a local JSON or YAML file that defines the condition. To see
          available fields, see the help for --condition.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the compute/alpha API. The full documentation for this
    API can be found at:

EXAMPLES
    To add an IAM policy binding for the role of 'roles/compute.admin' for the
    user 'test-user@gmail.com' with instance template 'my-template', run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instance-templates add-iam-policy-binding \
            my-template --member='user:test-user@gmail.com' \
            --role='roles/compute.admin'

    To add an IAM policy binding which expires at the end of the year 2018 for
    the role of 'roles/compute.admin' and the user 'test-user@gmail.com' with
    instance template 'my-template', run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instance-templates add-iam-policy-binding \
            my-template --member='user:test-user@gmail.com' \
            --role='roles/compute.admin' \
            --condition='expression=request.time <
         timestamp("2019-01-01T00:00:00Z"),title=expires_end_of_2018,descrip\
        tion=Expires at midnight on 2018-12-31'

    See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details of
