NAME
    gcloud alpha compute resource-policies create-vm-maintenance - create a
        Google Compute Engine VM Maintenance Resource Policy

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute resource-policies create-vm-maintenance NAME
        (--daily-window --start-time=START_TIME) [--description=DESCRIPTION]
        [--region=REGION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute resource-policies create-vm-maintenance
    creates a Resource Policy which can be attached to instances and specifies
    what kind of maintenance operations may be performed and when they can be
    performed.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the resource policy to operate on.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Cycle Frequency Group. This must be specified.

       --daily-window
          Maintenance activity window occurs daily at START_TIME. This flag
          must be specified if any of the other arguments in this group are
          specified.

       --start-time=START_TIME
          Start time of a four-hour window in which maintenance activity should
          start in given cadence. Valid choices are 00:00, 04:00, 08:00,12:00,
          16:00 and 20:00 UTC. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on
          time formats. For example, --start-time="03:00-05" (which gets
          converted to 08:00 UTC). This flag must be specified if any of the
          other arguments in this group are specified.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional, textual description for the backend.

     --region=REGION
        Region of the resource policy to operate on. If not specified, you may
        be prompted to select a region.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
