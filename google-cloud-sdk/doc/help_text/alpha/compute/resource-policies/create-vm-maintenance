DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute resource-policies create-vm-maintenance

    what kind of maintenance operations may be performed and when they can be
    performed.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the resource policy to operate on.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Cycle Frequency Group. Exactly one of these must be specified:

       From file

         --weekly-window-from-file=WEEKLY_CYCLE_FROM_FILE
            A file which defines a weekly cadence with multiple days and start
            times. The format is a JSON/YAML file containing a list of objects
            with the following fields:

            day: Day of the week with the same choices as --weekly-window.
            startTime: Start time of the snapshot schedule with the same format
            as --start-time.

       From flags

         --start-time=START_TIME
            Start time of a four-hour window in which maintenance activity
            should start in given cadence.. Valid choices are 00:00, 04:00,
            08:00,12:00, 16:00 and 20:00 UTC. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for
            information on time formats. For example, --start-time="03:00-05"
            (which gets converted to 08:00 UTC). This flag must be specified if
            any of the other arguments in this group are specified.

         Exactly one of these must be specified:

           --daily-window
              Maintenance activity window occurs daily at START_TIME.

           --weekly-window=WEEKLY_CYCLE
              Maintenance activity window occurs weekly on WEEKLY_WINDOW at
              START_TIME. WEEKLY_CYCLE must be one of: monday, tuesday,
              wednesday, thursday, friday, saturday, sunday.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional, textual description for the backend.

     --region=REGION
        The region of the resource policy to operate on. If not specified, you
        may be prompted to select a region.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

    users of ALPHA commands and flags need to apply for access, agree to
    applicable terms, and have their projects whitelisted. Contact Google or
