NAME
    gcloud alpha compute resource-policies delete - delete a Google Compute
        Engine resource policy

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute resource-policies delete NAME [--region=REGION]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Delete a Google Compute Engine resource policy.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the resource policy to operate on.

FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        Region of the resource policy to operate on. If not specified, you may
        be prompted to select a region.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

EXAMPLES
    The following command deletes a Google Compute Engine resource policy.

        $ gcloud alpha compute resource-policies delete my-resource-policy \
            --region=REGION

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access whitelist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute resource-policies delete
        $ gcloud beta compute resource-policies delete
