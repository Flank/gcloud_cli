SYNOPSIS

        [--description=DESCRIPTION] [--region=REGION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute vpn-gateways create creates a new High
    Available VPN gateway.

    High Available VPN Gateway provides a means to create a VPN solution with a
    higher availability SLA compared to Classic Target VPN Gateway. High
    Available VPN gateways are referred to as simply VPN gateways in the API
    documentation and gcloud commands. A VPN Gateway can reference one or more
    VPN tunnels that connect it to external VPN gateways or Cloud VPN Gateways.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the VPN Gateway to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --network=NETWORK
        A reference to a network to which the VPN gateway is attached.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional, textual description for the VPN Gateway.

     --region=REGION
        Region of the VPN Gateway to create. If not specified, you may be
        prompted to select a region.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.
