NAME
    gcloud alpha compute vpn-gateways create - create a new Google Compute
        Engine Highly Available VPN gateway

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute vpn-gateways create NAME --network=NETWORK
        [--description=DESCRIPTION] [--region=REGION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute vpn-gateways create creates a new Highly
    Available VPN gateway.

    Highly Available VPN Gateway provides a means to create a VPN solution with
    a higher availability SLA compared to Classic Target VPN Gateway. Highly
    Available VPN gateways are simply referred to as VPN gateways in the API
    documentation and gcloud commands. A VPN Gateway can reference one or more
    VPN tunnels that connect it to external VPN gateways or Cloud VPN Gateways.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the VPN Gateway to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --network=NETWORK
        A reference to a network to which the VPN gateway is attached.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional, textual description for the VPN Gateway.

     --region=REGION
        Region of the VPN Gateway to create. If not specified, you may be
        prompted to select a region.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

EXAMPLES
    To create a VPN gateway, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute vpn-gateways create my-vpn-gateway \
          --region=us-central1 --network=default

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access whitelist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute vpn-gateways create
        $ gcloud beta compute vpn-gateways create
