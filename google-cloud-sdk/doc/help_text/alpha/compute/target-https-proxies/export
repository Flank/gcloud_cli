NAME
    gcloud alpha compute target-https-proxies export - export a target HTTPS
        proxy

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute target-https-proxies export NAME
        [--destination=DESTINATION] [--global | --region=REGION]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Exports a target HTTPS proxy's configuration to a file. This
    configuration can be imported at a later time.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the target HTTPS proxy to export.

FLAGS
     --destination=DESTINATION
        Path to a YAML file where the configuration will be exported. The
        exported data will not contain any output-only fields. Alternatively,
        you may omit this flag to write to standard output. A schema describing
        the export/import format can be found in:
        $CLOUDSDKROOT/lib/googlecloudsdk/schemas/compute/alpha/TargetHttpsProxy.yaml.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --global
          If set, the target HTTPS proxy is global.

       --region=REGION
          Region of the target HTTPS proxy to export. If not specified, you may
          be prompted to select a region.

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/region property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/region

          Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    A target HTTPS proxy can be exported by running:

        $ gcloud alpha compute target-https-proxies export NAME \
            --destination=<path-to-file>

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute target-https-proxies export
        $ gcloud beta compute target-https-proxies export
