NAME
    gcloud alpha compute target-https-proxies delete - delete target HTTPS
        proxies

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute target-https-proxies delete NAME [NAME ...]
        [--global | --region=REGION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute target-https-proxies delete deletes one or
    more target HTTPS proxies.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME [NAME ...]
        Names of the target HTTPS proxies to delete.

FLAGS
     At most one of these may be specified:

       --global
          If set, the target HTTPS proxies are global.

       --region=REGION
          Region of the target HTTPS proxies to delete. If not specified, you
          may be prompted to select a region.

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/region property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/region

          Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    Delete a global target HTTPS proxy by running:

        $ gcloud alpha compute target-https-proxies delete PROXY_NAME

    Delete a regional target HTTPS proxy by running:

        $ gcloud alpha compute target-https-proxies delete PROXY_NAME \
            --region=REGION_NAME

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access whitelist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute target-https-proxies delete
        $ gcloud beta compute target-https-proxies delete
