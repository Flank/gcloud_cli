NAME
    gcloud alpha compute url-maps add-host-rule - add a rule to a URL map to
        map hosts to a path matcher

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute url-maps add-host-rule URL_MAP --hosts=HOST,[HOST,...]
        --path-matcher-name=PATH_MATCHER_NAME [--description=DESCRIPTION]
        [--global | --region=REGION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute url-maps add-host-rule is used to add a
    mapping of hosts to a patch matcher in a URL map. The mapping will match
    the host component of HTTP requests to path matchers which in turn map the
    request to a backend service. Before adding a host rule, at least one path
    matcher must exist in the URL map to take care of the path component of the
    requests. gcloud compute url-maps add-path-matcher or gcloud compute
    url-maps edit can be used to add path matchers.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     URL_MAP
        Name of the URL map to operate on.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --hosts=HOST,[HOST,...]
        The set of hosts to match requests against. Each host must be a fully
        qualified domain name (FQDN) with the exception that the host can begin
        with a ``*'' or ``*-''. ``*'' acts as a glob and will match any string
        of atoms to the left where an atom is separated by dots (``.'') or
        dashes (``-'').

     --path-matcher-name=PATH_MATCHER_NAME
        The name of the patch matcher to use if a request matches this host
        rule. The patch matcher must already exist in the URL map (see gcloud
        compute url-maps add-path-matcher).

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional, textual description for the host rule.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --global
          If set, the URL map is global.

       --region=REGION
          Region of the URL map to operate on. If not specified, you may be
          prompted to select a region.

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/region property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/region

          Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To create a host rule mapping the *-foo.example.com and example.com hosts
    to the www path matcher, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute url-maps add-host-rule MY-URL-MAP \
            --hosts='*-foo.example.com,example.com' --path-matcher-name=www

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute url-maps add-host-rule
        $ gcloud beta compute url-maps add-host-rule
