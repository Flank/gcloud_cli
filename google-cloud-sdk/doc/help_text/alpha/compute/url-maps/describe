NAME
    gcloud alpha compute url-maps describe - describe a URL map

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute url-maps describe URL_MAP_NAME
        [--global | --region=REGION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute url-maps describe displays all data associated
    with a URL map in a project.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     URL_MAP_NAME
        Name of the URL map to describe.

FLAGS
     At most one of these may be specified:

       --global
          If set, the URL map is global.

       --region=REGION
          Region of the URL map to describe. If not specified, you may be
          prompted to select a region.

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/region property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/region

          Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
