REQUIRED FLAGS
     --instance-filter=INSTANCE_FILTER
        Filter for selecting the instances to patch. Patching supports the same
        filter mechanisms as gcloud compute instances list, allowing one to
        patch specific instances by name, zone, label, or other criteria.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     Settings for machines running Apt:

       --apt-dist
          If specified, machines running Apt use the apt-get dist-upgrade
          command; otherwise the apt-get upgrade command is used.

     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Textual description of the patch job.

     --dry-run
        Whether to execute this patch job as a dry run. If this patch job is a
        dry run, instances are contacted, but the patch is not run.

     --duration=DURATION
        Total duration in which the patch job must complete. If the patch does
        not complete in this time, the process times out. While some instances
        might still be running the patch, they will not continue to work after
        completing the current step. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for
        information on specifying absolute time durations.

        If unspecified, the job stays active until all instances complete the
        patch.

     --reboot-config=REBOOT_CONFIG
        Post-patch reboot settings. REBOOT_CONFIG must be one of:

         always
            Always reboot the machine after the update completes.
         default
            The agent decides if a reboot is necessary by checking signals such
            as registry keys or '/var/run/reboot-required'.
         never
            Never reboot the machine after the update completes.

     --retry
        Specifies whether to attempt to retry, within the duration window, if
        patching initially fails. If omitted, the agent uses its default retry
        strategy.

     Post-patch step settings for Linux machines:

       --post-patch-linux-executable=POST_PATCH_LINUX_EXECUTABLE
          A set of commands to run on a Linux machine after an OS patch
          completes. Commands must be supplied in a file. If the file contains
          a shell script, include the shebang line.

          The path to the file must be supplied in one of the following
          formats:

          An absolute path of the file on the local filesystem.

          A URI for a Google Cloud Storage object with a generation number.

       --post-patch-linux-success-codes=[POST_PATCH_LINUX_SUCCESS_CODES,...]
          Additional exit codes that the executable can return to indicate a
          successful run. The default exit code for success is 0.

     Post-patch step settings for Windows machines:

       --post-patch-windows-executable=POST_PATCH_WINDOWS_EXECUTABLE
          A set of commands to run on a Windows machine after an OS patch
          completes. Commands must be supplied in a file. If the file contains
          a PowerShell script, include the .ps1 file extension. The PowerShell
          script executes with flags -NonInteractive, -NoProfile, and
          -ExecutionPolicy Bypass.

          The path to the file must be supplied in one of the following
          formats:

          An absolute path of the file on the local filesystem.

          A URI for a Google Cloud Storage object with a generation number.

       --post-patch-windows-success-codes=[POST_PATCH_WINDOWS_SUCCESS_CODES,...]
          Additional exit codes that the executable can return to indicate a
          successful run. The default exit code for success is 0.

     Pre-patch step settings for Linux machines:

       --pre-patch-linux-executable=PRE_PATCH_LINUX_EXECUTABLE
          A set of commands to run on a Linux machine before an OS patch
          begins. Commands must be supplied in a file. If the file contains a
          shell script, include the shebang line.

          The path to the file must be supplied in one of the following
          formats:

          An absolute path of the file on the local filesystem.

          A URI for a Google Cloud Storage object with a generation number.

       --pre-patch-linux-success-codes=[PRE_PATCH_LINUX_SUCCESS_CODES,...]
          Additional exit codes that the executable can return to indicate a
          successful run. The default exit code for success is 0.

     Pre-patch step settings for Windows machines:

       --pre-patch-windows-executable=PRE_PATCH_WINDOWS_EXECUTABLE
          A set of commands to run on a Windows machine before an OS patch
          begins. Commands must be supplied in a file. If the file contains a
          PowerShell script, include the .ps1 file extension. The PowerShell
          script executes with flags -NonInteractive, -NoProfile, and
          -ExecutionPolicy Bypass.

       --pre-patch-windows-success-codes=[PRE_PATCH_WINDOWS_SUCCESS_CODES,...]
          Additional exit codes that the executable can return to indicate a
          successful run. The default exit code for success is 0.

       --windows-classifications=[WINDOWS_CLASSIFICATIONS,...]
          List of classifications to use to restrict the Windows update. Only
          patches of the given classifications are applied. If omitted, a
          default Windows update is performed. For more information on
          classifications, see:
          https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/824684.

          using the Yum --exclude flag.

       --yum-minimal
          If specified, machines running Yum use the command yum
          update-minimal; otherwise the patch uses yum-update.

       --yum-security
          If specified, machines running Yum append the --security flag to the
          patch command.

     Settings for machines running Zypper:

       --zypper-categories=[ZYPPER_CATEGORIES,...]

        $ gcloud alpha compute os-config patch-jobs execute \
        --instance-filter="name=my-instance" \
        --windows-classifications=SECURITY,CRITICAL

    To patch all instances in the current project and specify scripts to run

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
