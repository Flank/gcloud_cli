NAME
    gcloud alpha compute os-config guest-policies create - create a guest
        policy for a project, a folder, or an organization

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute os-config guest-policies create POLICY_ID --file=FILE
        [--description=DESCRIPTION]
        [--folder=FOLDER_ID | --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          | --project=PROJECT_ID] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     POLICY_ID
        ID of the guest policy to create.

        This ID must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens,
        start with a letter, end with a number or a letter, be between 1-63
        characters, and unique within the project, folder, or organization.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --file=FILE
        The JSON or YAML file with the guest policy to create.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Description of the guest policy to create. Length of the description is
        limited to 1024 characters.

        If specified, it will override any description provided in the file.

     The scope of the guest policy which defaults to project if unspecified. At
     most one of these may be specified:

       --folder=FOLDER_ID
          The folder of the guest policy to create.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          The organization of the guest policy to create.

       --project=PROJECT_ID
          The project of the guest policy to create.

          The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
          omitted, then the current project is assumed; the current project can
          be listed using gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)' and
          can be set using gcloud config set project PROJECTID.

          --project and its fallback core/project property play two roles in
          the invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate
          on. It also specifies the project for API enablement check, quota,
          and billing. To specify a different project for quota and billing,
          use --billing-project or billing/quota_project property.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

EXAMPLES
    To create a guest policy 'policy1' in the current project, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute os-config guest-policies create policy1 \
        --file=path_to_config_file

    To create a guest policy 'policy1' in the organization '12345', run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute os-config guest-policies create policy1 \
        --file=path_to_config_file \
        --organization=12345

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access whitelist.
