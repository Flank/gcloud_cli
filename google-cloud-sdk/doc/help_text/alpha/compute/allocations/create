DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Create a Compute Engine zonal allocation.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     ALLOCATION
        Name of the zonal allocation to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --commitment=COMMITMENT
        Name of the regional commitment to operate on.

     Manage the specific SKU allocation properties to create This must be
     specified.

       --machine-type=MACHINE_TYPE
          The type of machine (name only) which has fixed number of vCPUs and
          fixed amount of memory. This also includes specifying custom machine
          type following custom-NUMBER_OF_CPUS-AMOUNT_OF_MEMORY pattern. This
          flag must be specified if any of the other arguments in this group
          are specified.

       --vm-count=VM_COUNT
          The number of resources that are allocated to this allocation. This
          flag must be specified if any of the other arguments in this group
          are specified.

       --accelerator=[count=COUNT],[type=TYPE]
          Manage the configuration of the type and number of accelerator cards
          attached.

       count
          The number of pieces of the accelerator to attach to the allocation.

       type
          The specific type (e.g. nvidia-tesla-k80 for nVidia Tesla K80) of
          accelerator to attach to the allocation. Use 'gcloud compute
          accelerator-types list' to learn about all available accelerator
          types.

       --local-ssd=[interface=INTERFACE],[size=SIZE]
          Manage the size and the interface of local SSD to use.

       interface
          The kind of disk interface exposed to the VM for this SSD. Valid
          values are scsi and nvme. SCSI is the default and is supported by
          more guest operating systems. NVME may provide higher performance.

       size
          The size of the local SSD in base-2 GB.
       --min-cpu-platform=MIN_CPU_PLATFORM
          The minimum cpu platform of the allocation.

       --require-specific-allocation
          Indicates whether the allocation can be consumed by VMs with "any
          allocation" defined. If enabled, then only VMs that target the
          allocation by name using --allocation-affinity can consume this
          allocation. It also indicates that if true, the existing instances
          are also accounted in the allocation.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --commitment-region=COMMITMENT_REGION
        Region of the regional commitment to operate on. If not specified, you
        may be prompted to select a region.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        A text description of the allocation to create.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the zonal allocation to create. If not specified and the
        compute/zone property isn't set, you may be prompted to select a zone.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
