NAME
    gcloud alpha compute allocations update-resource-shape - update the
        resource shape a Compute Engine zonal allocation

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute allocations update-resource-shape ALLOCATION
        --destination=DESTINATION --vm-count=VM_COUNT [--zone=ZONE]
        [[--machine-type=MACHINE_TYPE : --accelerator=[count=COUNT],[type=TYPE]
          --local-ssd=[interface=INTERFACE],[size=SIZE]
          --min-cpu-platform=MIN_CPU_PLATFORM]] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Update the resource shape a Compute Engine zonal allocation. This
    command changes the zonal allocation and the machines updated would be
    added to the destination allocation.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     ALLOCATION
        Name of the zonal allocation to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --destination=DESTINATION
        The name of destination allocation where the machines are added. If
        existing, its machine spec must match the modified machine spec. If non
        existing, new allocation with this name and modified machine spec is
        created automatically.

     --vm-count=VM_COUNT
        The number of resources that are allocated to this allocation.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the zonal allocation to create. If not specified and the
        compute/zone property isn't set, you may be prompted to select a zone.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

     Manage the specific SKU allocation properties to update

       --machine-type=MACHINE_TYPE
          The type of machine (name only) which has fixed number of vCPUs and
          fixed amount of memory. This also includes specifying custom machine
          type following custom-NUMBER_OF_CPUS-AMOUNT_OF_MEMORY pattern. This
          flag must be specified if any of the other arguments in this group
          are specified.

       --accelerator=[count=COUNT],[type=TYPE]
          Manage the configuration of the type and number of accelerator cards
          attached.

       count
          The number of pieces of the accelerator to attach to the allocation.

       type
          The specific type (e.g. nvidia-tesla-k80 for nVidia Tesla K80) of
          accelerator to attach to the allocation. Use 'gcloud compute
          accelerator-types list' to learn about all available accelerator
          types.

       --local-ssd=[interface=INTERFACE],[size=SIZE]
          Manage the size and the interface of local SSD to use.

       interface
          The kind of disk interface exposed to the VM for this SSD. Valid
          values are scsi and nvme. SCSI is the default and is supported by
          more guest operating systems. NVME may provide higher performance.

       size
          The size of the local SSD in base-2 GB.
       --min-cpu-platform=MIN_CPU_PLATFORM
          The minimum cpu platform of the allocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
