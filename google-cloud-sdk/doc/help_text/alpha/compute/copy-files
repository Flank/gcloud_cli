NAME
    gcloud alpha compute copy-files - copy files to and from Google Compute
        Engine virtual machines via scp

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute copy-files [[USER@]INSTANCE:]SRC
        [[[USER@]INSTANCE:]SRC ...] [[USER@]INSTANCE:]DEST [--dry-run]
        [--force-key-file-overwrite] [--plain] [--ssh-key-file=SSH_KEY_FILE]
        [--strict-host-key-checking=STRICT_HOST_KEY_CHECKING] [--zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) (DEPRECATED) gcloud compute copy-files is deprecated. Please use
    gcloud compute scp instead. Note that gcloud compute scp does not have
    recursive copy on by default. To turn on recursion, use the --recurse flag.

    gcloud alpha compute copy-files copies files between a virtual machine
    instance and your local machine using the scp command. This command does
    not work for Windows VMs.

    To denote a remote file, prefix the file name with the virtual machine
    instance name (e.g., example-instance:~/FILE). To denote a local file, do
    not add a prefix to the file name (e.g., ~/FILE). For example, to copy a
    remote directory to your local host, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute copy-files example-instance:~/REMOTE-DIR \
            ~/LOCAL-DIR --zone us-central1-a

    In the above example, ~/REMOTE-DIR from example-instance is copied into the
    ~/LOCAL-DIR directory.

    Conversely, files from your local computer can be copied to a virtual
    machine:

        $ gcloud alpha compute copy-files ~/LOCAL-FILE-1 ~/LOCAL-FILE-2 \
            example-instance:~/REMOTE-DIR --zone us-central1-a

    If a file contains a colon (``:''), you must specify it by either using an
    absolute path or a path that begins with ``./''.

    Under the covers, scp(1) or pscp (on Windows) is used to facilitate the
    transfer.

    When the destination is local, all sources must be the same virtual machine
    instance. When the destination is remote, all sources must be local.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     [[USER@]INSTANCE:]SRC [[[USER@]INSTANCE:]SRC ...]
        Specifies the files to copy.

     [[USER@]INSTANCE:]DEST
        Specifies a destination for the source files.

FLAGS
     --dry-run
        Print the equivalent scp/ssh command that would be run to stdout,
        instead of executing it.

     --force-key-file-overwrite
        If enabled, the gcloud command-line tool will regenerate and overwrite
        the files associated with a broken SSH key without asking for
        confirmation in both interactive and non-interactive environments.

        If disabled, the files associated with a broken SSH key will not be
        regenerated and will fail in both interactive and non-interactive
        environments.

     --plain
        Suppress the automatic addition of ssh(1)/scp(1) flags. This flag is
        useful if you want to take care of authentication yourself or use
        specific ssh/scp features.

     --ssh-key-file=SSH_KEY_FILE
        The path to the SSH key file. By default, this is
        ~/.ssh/google_compute_engine.

     --strict-host-key-checking=STRICT_HOST_KEY_CHECKING
        Override the default behavior of StrictHostKeyChecking for the
        connection. By default, StrictHostKeyChecking is set to 'no' the first
        time you connect to an instance, and will be set to 'yes' for all
        subsequent connections. STRICT_HOST_KEY_CHECKING must be one of: yes,
        no, ask.

     --zone=ZONE
        The zone of the instance to copy files to/from.

        If not specified and the compute/zone property isn't set, you may be
        prompted to select a zone.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
    https://cloud.google.com/support/. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute copy-files
        $ gcloud beta compute copy-files
