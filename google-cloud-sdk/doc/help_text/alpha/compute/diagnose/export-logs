NAME
    gcloud alpha compute diagnose export-logs - triggers instance to gather
        logs and upload them to a Cloud Storage Bucket

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute diagnose export-logs INSTANCE_NAME
        [--collect-process-traces] [--zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Gathers logs from a running Compute Engine VM and exports them to a
    Google Cloud Storage Bucket. Outputs a path to the logs within the Bucket.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAME
        Name of the instance to operate on.

FLAGS
     --collect-process-traces
        Collect a 10 minute trace of the running system. On Windows, this
        utilizes Windows Performance Recorder. It records CPU, disk, file, and
        network activity during that time.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the instance to operate on. If not specified, you may be
        prompted to select a zone. gcloud will attempt to identify the zone by
        searching for resources in your project. If the zone cannot be
        determined, you will then be prompted with all Google Cloud Platform
        zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

NOTES
    This command is an internal implementation detail and may change or
    disappear without notice. This command is currently in ALPHA and may change
    without notice. If this command fails with API permission errors despite
    specifying the right project, you will have to apply for early access and
    have your projects registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so,
