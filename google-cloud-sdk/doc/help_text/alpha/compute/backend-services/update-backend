DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute backend-services update-backend updates a
    backend that is part of a backend service. This is useful for changing the
    way a backend behaves. Example changes that can be made include changing
    the load balancing policy and draining a backend by setting its capacity
    scaler to zero.

    Backends are named by their associated instances groups or network endpoint
    groups, and one of the --network-endpoint-group or --instance-group flags
    is required to identify the backend that you are modifying. You cannot
    "change" the instance group or network endpoint group associated with a
    backend, but you can accomplish something similar with backend-services
    remove-backend and backend-services add-backend.

    gcloud compute backend-services edit can also be used to update a backend
    if the use of a text editor is desired.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME
        Name of the backend service to operate on.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       Instance Group

         --instance-group=INSTANCE_GROUP
            Name of the instance group to update in the backend service. For
            details on valid instance names, refer to the criteria documented
            under the field 'name' at:
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances
            This flag must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
            group are specified.

         At most one of these may be specified:

           --instance-group-region=INSTANCE_GROUP_REGION
              Region of the instance group to update in the backend service. If
              not specified, you may be prompted to select a region.

              To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
              compute/region property:

                  $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

              A list of regions can be fetched by running:

                  $ gcloud compute regions list

              To unset the property, run:

                  $ gcloud config unset compute/region

              Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment
              variable CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

           --instance-group-zone=INSTANCE_GROUP_ZONE
              Zone of the instance group to update in the backend service. If
              not specified and the compute/zone property isn't set, you may be
              prompted to select a zone.

              To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
              compute/zone property:

                  $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

              A list of zones can be fetched by running:

                  $ gcloud compute zones list

              To unset the property, run:

                  $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

              Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
              CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

       Network Endpoint Group

         --network-endpoint-group=NETWORK_ENDPOINT_GROUP
            Name of the network endpoint group to update in the backend
            service. This flag must be specified if any of the other arguments
            in this group are specified.

         --network-endpoint-group-zone=NETWORK_ENDPOINT_GROUP_ZONE
            Zone of the network endpoint group to update in the backend
            service. If not specified and the compute/zone property isn't set,
            you may be prompted to select a zone.

            To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
            compute/zone property:

                $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

            A list of zones can be fetched by running:

                $ gcloud compute zones list

            To unset the property, run:

                $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

            Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
            CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --balancing-mode=BALANCING_MODE
        Defines the strategy for balancing load. BALANCING_MODE must be one of:

         CONNECTION
            Available if the backend service's load balancing scheme is either
            INTERNAL or EXTERNAL. Available if the backend service's protocol
            is one of SSL, TCP, or UDP.

                Spreads load based on how many concurrent connections the backend
                can handle.

                For backend services with --load-balancing-scheme `EXTERNAL`, you
                must specify exactly one of these additional parameters:
                `--max-connections`, `--max-connections-per-instance`, or
                `--max-connections-per-endpoint`.

                For backend services where `--load-balancing-scheme` is `INTERNAL`,
                you must omit all of these parameters.
         RATE
            Available if the backend service's load balancing scheme is
            INTERNAL_MANAGED, INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED, or EXTERNAL. Available if
            the backend service's protocol is one of HTTP, HTTPS, or HTTP/2.

                Spreads load based on how many HTTP requests per second (RPS) the
                backend can handle.

                You must specify exactly one of these additional parameters:
                `--max-rate`, `--max-rate-per-instance`, or `--max-rate-per-endpoint`.
         UTILIZATION
            Available if the backend service's load balancing scheme is
            INTERNAL_MANAGED, INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED, or EXTERNAL. Available
            only for managed or unmanaged instance group backends.

                Spreads load based on the CPU utilization of instances in a backend
                instance group.

                The following additional parameters may be specified:
                `--max-utilization`, `--max-rate`, `--max-rate-per-instance`,
                `--max-connections`, `--max-connections-per-instance`.
                For valid combinations, see `--max-utilization`.

     --capacity-scaler=CAPACITY_SCALER
        A setting that applies to all balancing modes. This value is multiplied
        by the balancing mode value to set the current max usage of the
        instance group. Acceptable values are 0.0 (0%) through 1.0 (100%).
        Setting this value to 0.0 (0%) drains the backend service. Note that
        draining a backend service only prevents new connections to instances
        in the group. All existing connections are allowed to continue until
        they close by normal means. This cannot be used for internal load
        balancing.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional, textual description for the backend.

     --failover
        Designates whether this is a failover backend. More than one failover
        backend can be configured for a given BackendService. Not compatible
        with the --global flag

     --max-utilization=MAX_UTILIZATION
        Defines the maximum target for average utilization of the backend
        instance in the backend instance group. Acceptable values are 0.0 (0%)
        through 1.0(100%). Available for all backend service protocols, with
        --balancing-mode=UTILIZATION.

        For backend services that use SSL, TCP, or UDP protocols, the following
        configuration options are supported:

        * no additional parameter
        * only --max-utilization
        * only --max-connections (except for regional managed instance
          groups)
        * only --max-connections-per-instance
        * both --max-utilization and --max-connections (except for regional
          managed instance groups)
        * both --max-utilization and --max-connections-per-instance

    The meanings for -max-connections and --max-connections-per-instance are
    the same as for --balancing-mode=CONNECTION. If one is used with
    --max-utilization, instances are considered at capacity when either maximum
    utilization or maximum connections is reached.

    For backend services that use HTTP, HTTPS, or HTTP/2 protocols, the
    following configuration options are supported:

      o no additional parameter
      o only --max-utilization
      o only --max-rate (except for regional managed instance groups)
      o only --max-rate-per-instance
      o both --max-utilization and --max-rate (except for regional managed
        instance groups)
      o both --max-utilization and --max-rate-per-instance

    The meanings for --max-rate and --max-rate-per-instance are the same as for
    --balancing-mode=RATE. If one is used in conjunction with
    --max-utilization, instances are considered at capacity when either maximum
    utilization or the maximum rate is reached.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --global
          If set, the backend service is global.

       --region=REGION
          Region of the backend service to operate on. Overrides the default
          compute/region property value for this command invocation.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --max-connections=MAX_CONNECTIONS
          Maximum concurrent connections that the backend can handle. Valid for
          network endpoint group and instance group backends (except for
          regional managed instance groups).

       --max-connections-per-endpoint=MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_ENDPOINT
          Only valid for network endpoint group backends. Defines a maximum
          number of connections per endpoint if all endpoints are healthy. When
          one or more endpoints are unhealthy, an effective maximum number of
          connections per healthy endpoint is calculated by multiplying
          MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_ENDPOINT by the number of endpoints in the
          network endpoint group, then dividing by the number of healthy
          endpoints.

       --max-connections-per-instance=MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_INSTANCE
          Only valid for instance group backends. Defines a maximum number of
          concurrent connections per instance if all instances in the instance
          group are healthy. When one or more instances are unhealthy, an
          effective maximum number of connections per healthy instance is
          calculated by multiplying MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_INSTANCE by the number
          of instances in the instance group, then dividing by the number of
          healthy instances.

       --max-rate=MAX_RATE
          Maximum number of HTTP requests per second (RPS) that the backend can
          handle. Valid for network endpoint group and instance group backends
          (except for regional managed instance groups). Must not be defined if
          the backend is a managed instance group using load balancing-based
          autoscaling.

       --max-rate-per-endpoint=MAX_RATE_PER_ENDPOINT
          Only valid for network endpoint group backends. Defines a maximum
          number of HTTP requests per second (RPS) per endpoint if all
          endpoints are healthy. When one or more endpoints are unhealthy, an
          effective maximum rate per healthy endpoint is calculated by
          multiplying MAX_RATE_PER_ENDPOINT by the number of endpoints in the
          network endpoint group, then dividing by the number of healthy
          endpoints.

       --max-rate-per-instance=MAX_RATE_PER_INSTANCE
          Only valid for instance group backends. Defines a maximum number of
          HTTP requests per second (RPS) per instance if all instances in the
          instance group are healthy. When one or more instances are unhealthy,
          an effective maximum RPS per healthy instance is calculated by
          multiplying MAX_RATE_PER_INSTANCE by the number of instances in the
          instance group, then dividing by the number of healthy instances.
          This parameter is compatible with managed instance group backends
          that use autoscaling based on load balancing.
