NAME
    gcloud alpha compute ssl-policies delete - delete Google Compute Engine SSL
        policies

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute ssl-policies delete NAME [NAME ...]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute ssl-policies delete is used to delete one or
    more Google Compute Engine SSL policies. SSL policies can only be deleted
    when no other resources (e.g., Target HTTPS proxies, Target SSL proxies)
    refer to them.

    An SSL policy specifies the server-side support for SSL features. An SSL
    policy can be attached to a TargetHttpsProxy or a TargetSslProxy. This
    affects connections between clients and the HTTPS or SSL proxy load
    balancer. SSL policies do not affect the connection between the load
    balancers and the backends.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME [NAME ...]
        Names of the SSL policies to delete.

    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.
