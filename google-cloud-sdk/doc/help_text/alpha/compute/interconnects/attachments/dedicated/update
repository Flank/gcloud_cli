NAME
    gcloud alpha compute interconnects attachments dedicated update - update a
        Google Compute Engine dedicated interconnect attachment

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute interconnects attachments dedicated update NAME
        [--admin-enabled] [--description=DESCRIPTION] [--region=REGION]
        [--update-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]]
        [--clear-labels | --remove-labels=[KEY,...]] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute interconnects attachments dedicated update is
    used to update interconnect attachments. An interconnect attachment is what
    binds the underlying connectivity of an interconnect to a path into and out
    of the customer's cloud network.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        The name of the interconnect attachment to patch.

FLAGS
     --admin-enabled
        Administrative status of the interconnect attachment. When this is
        enabled, the attachment is operational and will carry traffic. Use
        --no-admin-enabled to disable it.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Human-readable plain-text description of attachment.

     --region=REGION
        The region of the interconnect attachment to patch. If not specified,
        you will be prompted to select a region.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     --update-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        A list of label KEY=VALUE pairs to update. If a label exists its value
        is modified, otherwise a new label is created.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --clear-labels
          Removes all labels. If --update-labels is also specified then
          --clear-labels is applied first.

          For example, to remove all labels:

              $ gcloud alpha compute interconnects attachments dedicated update \
                --clear-labels

          To set the labels to exactly "foo" and "baz":

              $ gcloud alpha compute interconnects attachments dedicated update \
                --clear-labels --update-labels foo=bar,baz=qux

       --remove-labels=[KEY,...]
          A list of label keys to remove. If a label does not exist it is
          silently ignored.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

    disappear without notice. This command is currently in ALPHA and may change
    without notice. Usually, users of ALPHA commands and flags need to apply
    for access, agree to applicable terms, and have their projects whitelisted.
