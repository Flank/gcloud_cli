DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute interconnects attachments dedicated create is
    used to create a dedicated interconnect attachments. An interconnect
    attachment is what binds the underlying connectivity of an interconnect to
    a path into and out of the customer's cloud network.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the interconnect attachment to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --interconnect=INTERCONNECT
        The interconnect for the interconnect attachment

     --router=ROUTER
        The Google Cloud Router to use for dynamic routing.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --bandwidth=BANDWIDTH
        Provisioned capacity of the attachment. BANDWIDTH must be one of:

         50m
            50 Mbit/s
         100m
            100 Mbit/s
         200m
            200 Mbit/s
         300m
            300 Mbit/s
         400m
            400 Mbit/s
         500m
            500 Mbit/s
         1g
            1 Gbit/s
         2g
            2 Gbit/s
         5g
            5 Gbit/s
         10g
            10 Gbit/s
         20g
            20 Gbit/s
         50g
            50 Gbit/s

     --candidate-subnets=[SUBNET,...]
        Up to 16 candidate prefixes that can be used to restrict the allocation
        of cloudRouterIpAddress and customerRouterIpAddress for this
        attachment. All prefixes must be within link-local address space.
        Google will attempt to select an unused /29 from the supplied candidate
        subnet(s), or all of link-local space if no subnets supplied. Google
        will not re-use a /29 already in-use by your project, even if it's
        contained in one of the candidate subnets. The request will fail if all
        /29s within the candidate subnets are in use at Google's edge.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Human-readable plain-text description of attachment.

     --dry-run
        If supplied, validates the attachment without creating it.

     --enable-admin
        Administrative status of the interconnect attachment. If not provided
        on creation, defaults to enabled. When this is enabled, the attachment
        is operational and will carry traffic. Use --no-enable-admin to disable
        it.

     --mtu=MTU
        Maximum transmission unit(MTU) is the size of the largest frame passing
        through this interconnect attachment. Only 1440 and 1500 are allowed.
        If not specified, the value will default to 1440.

     --region=REGION
        Region of the interconnect attachment to create. If not specified, you
        may be prompted to select a region.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     --vlan=VLAN
        Desired VLAN for this attachment, in the range 2-4094. If not supplied,
        Google will automatically select a VLAN.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute interconnects attachments dedicated create
        $ gcloud beta compute interconnects attachments dedicated create
