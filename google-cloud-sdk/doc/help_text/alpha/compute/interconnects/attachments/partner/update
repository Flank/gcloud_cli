NAME
    gcloud alpha compute interconnects attachments partner update - update a
        Google Compute Engine partner interconnect attachment

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute interconnects attachments partner update NAME
        [--description=DESCRIPTION] [--enable-admin] [--region=REGION]
        [--update-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]]
        [--clear-labels | --remove-labels=[KEY,...]] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute interconnects attachments partner update is
    used to update partner interconnect attachments. A partner interconnect
    attachment binds the underlying connectivity of a provider's Interconnect
    to a path into and out of the customer's cloud network.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the interconnect attachment to patch.

FLAGS
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Human-readable plain-text description of attachment.

     --enable-admin
        Administrative status of the interconnect attachment. When this is
        enabled, the attachment is operational and will carry traffic. Use
        --no-enable-admin to disable it.

     --region=REGION
        The region of the interconnect attachment to patch. If not specified,
        you may be prompted to select a region.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     --update-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        A list of label KEY=VALUE pairs to update. If a label exists its value
        is modified, otherwise a new label is created.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --clear-labels
          Removes all labels. If --update-labels is also specified then
          --clear-labels is applied first.

          For example, to remove all labels:

              $ gcloud alpha compute interconnects attachments partner update \
                --clear-labels

          To set the labels to exactly "foo" and "baz":

              $ gcloud alpha compute interconnects attachments partner update \
                --clear-labels --update-labels foo=bar,baz=qux

       --remove-labels=[KEY,...]
          A list of label keys to remove. If a label does not exist it is
          silently ignored.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. Usually,
    users of ALPHA commands and flags need to apply for access, agree to
    applicable terms, and have their projects whitelisted. Contact Google or
    sign up on a product's page for ALPHA access. Product pages can be found at
