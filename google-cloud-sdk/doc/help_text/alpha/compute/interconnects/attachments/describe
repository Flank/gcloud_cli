SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute interconnects attachments describe NAME
        [--region=REGION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute interconnects attachments describe displays
    all data associated with Google Compute Engine interconnect attachment in a
    project.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        The name of the interconnect attachment to describe.

FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        The region of the interconnect attachment to describe. If not
        specified, you will be prompted to select a region.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.
