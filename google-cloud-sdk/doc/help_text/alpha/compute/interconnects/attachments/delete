     NAME [NAME ...]
        The names of the interconnect attachments to delete.

FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        The region of the interconnect attachments to delete. If not specified,
        you may be prompted to select a region.

        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.
