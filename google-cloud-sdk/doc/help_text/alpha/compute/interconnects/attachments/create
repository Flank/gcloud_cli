NAME
    gcloud alpha compute interconnects attachments create - create a Google
        Compute Engine interconnect attachment

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute interconnects attachments create NAME
        --interconnect=INTERCONNECT --router=ROUTER [--description=DESCRIPTION]
        [--region=REGION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) (REMOVED) Create a Google Compute Engine interconnect attachment.

        `create` has been removed. Please use `gcloud compute interconnects attachments dedicated create` instead.

    gcloud alpha compute interconnects attachments create is used to create
    interconnect attachments. An interconnect attachment is what binds the
    underlying connectivity of an Interconnect to a path into and out of the
    customer's cloud network.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the interconnect attachment to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --interconnect=INTERCONNECT
        The interconnect for the interconnect attachment

     --router=ROUTER
        The Google Cloud Router to use for dynamic routing.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional, textual description for the interconnect attachment.

     --region=REGION
        Region of the interconnect attachment to create. If not specified, you
        may be prompted to select a region.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

    disappear without notice. This command is currently in ALPHA and may change
    without notice. If this command fails with API permission errors despite
    specifying the right project, you will have to apply for early access and
