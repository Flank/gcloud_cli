NAME
    gcloud alpha compute target-http-proxies create - create a target HTTP
        proxy

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute target-http-proxies create NAME --url-map=URL_MAP
        [--description=DESCRIPTION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute target-http-proxies create is used to create
    target HTTP proxies. A target HTTP proxy is referenced by one or more
    forwarding rules which define which packets the proxy is responsible for
    routing. The target HTTP proxy points to a URL map that defines the rules
    for routing the requests. The URL map's job is to map URLs to backend
    services which handle the actual requests.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the target HTTP proxy to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --url-map=URL_MAP
        A reference to a URL map resource that defines the mapping of URLs to
        backend services. The URL map must exist and cannot be deleted while
        referenced by a target HTTP proxy.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional, textual description for the target HTTP proxy.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    If there is an already-created URL map with the name URL_MAP, create a
    target HTTP proxy pointing to this map by running:

        $ gcloud alpha compute target-http-proxies create PROXY_NAME \
            --url-map URL_MAP

    To create a proxy with a textual description, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute target-http-proxies create PROXY_NAME \
            --url-map URL_MAP --description "default proxy"
