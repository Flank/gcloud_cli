NAME
    gcloud alpha compute target-pools set-backup - set a backup pool for a
        target pool

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute target-pools set-backup NAME
        (--backup-pool=BACKUP_POOL | --no-backup-pool)
        [--failover-ratio=FAILOVER_RATIO] [--region=REGION]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute target-pools set-backup is used to set a
    backup target pool for a primary target pool, which defines the fallback
    behavior of the primary pool. If the ratio of the healthy instances in the
    primary pool is at or below the specified --failover-ratio value, then
    traffic arriving at the load-balanced IP address will be directed to the
    backup pool.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        The name of the target pool for which to set the backup pool.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --backup-pool=BACKUP_POOL
          Name of the target pool that will serve as backup.

       --no-backup-pool
          Unsets the backup pool. This disables failover.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --failover-ratio=FAILOVER_RATIO
        The new failover ratio value for the target pool. This must be a float
        in the range of [0, 1].

     --region=REGION
        Region of the target pool to set a backup pool for. If not specified,
        you may be prompted to select a region.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

EXAMPLES
    To cause TARGET-POOL (in region us-central1) to fail over to BACKUP-POOL
    when more than half of the TARGET-POOL instances are unhealthy, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute target-pools set-backup TARGET-POOL \
            --backup-pool BACKUP-POOL --failover-ratio 0.5 \
            --region us-central1

    To remove BACKUP-POOL as a backup to TARGET-POOL, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute target-pools set-backup TARGET-POOL \
            --backup-pool '' --region us-central1

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at

        $ gcloud compute target-pools set-backup
        $ gcloud beta compute target-pools set-backup
