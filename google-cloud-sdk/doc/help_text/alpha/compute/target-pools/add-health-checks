NAME
    gcloud alpha compute target-pools add-health-checks - add an HTTP health
        check to a target pool

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute target-pools add-health-checks NAME
        --http-health-check=HTTP_HEALTH_CHECK [--region=REGION]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute target-pools add-health-checks is used to add
    an HTTP health check to a target pool. Health checks are used to determine
    the health status of instances in the target pool. Only one health check
    can be attached to a target pool, so this command will fail if there as
    already a health check attached to the target pool. For more information on
    health checks and load balancing, see
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing-and-autoscaling/

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        The name of the target pool to which to add the health check.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --http-health-check=HTTP_HEALTH_CHECK
        Specifies an HTTP health check object to add to the target pool.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        Region of the target pool to add health checks to. If not specified,
        you may be prompted to select a region.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.
