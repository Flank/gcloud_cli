NAME
    gcloud alpha compute target-pools delete - delete target pools

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute target-pools delete NAME [NAME ...] [--region=REGION]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute target-pools delete deletes one or more Google
    Compute Engine target pools.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME [NAME ...]
        Names of the target pools to delete.

FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        Region of the target pools to delete. If not specified, you may be
        prompted to select a region.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access whitelist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute target-pools delete
        $ gcloud beta compute target-pools delete
