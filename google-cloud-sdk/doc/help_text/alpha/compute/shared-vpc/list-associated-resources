NAME
    gcloud alpha compute shared-vpc list-associated-resources - list the
        resources associated with the given shared VPC host project

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute shared-vpc list-associated-resources PROJECT_ID
        [--filter=EXPRESSION] [--limit=LIMIT] [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE]
        [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]] [--uri] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) List the resources associated with the given shared VPC host
    project.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     PROJECT_ID
        ID for the project to get associated resources for

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        The maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        A comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --uri
        Print a list of resource URIs instead of the default output.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    If service-project1 and service-project2 are associated service projects of
    the shared VPC host project host-project,

        $ gcloud alpha compute shared-vpc list-associated-resources \
            host-project

    yields the output

        RESOURCE_ID         RESOURCE_TYPE
        service-project1    PROJECT
        service-project2    PROJECT

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. Usually,
    users of ALPHA commands and flags need to apply for access, agree to
    applicable terms, and have their projects whitelisted. Contact Google or
    sign up on a product's page for ALPHA access. Product pages can be found at

        $ gcloud compute shared-vpc list-associated-resources
        $ gcloud beta compute shared-vpc list-associated-resources
