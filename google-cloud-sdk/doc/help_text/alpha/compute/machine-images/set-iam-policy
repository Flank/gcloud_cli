SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute machine-images set-iam-policy MACHINE_IMAGE
        POLICY_FILE [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Sets the IAM policy for the given machine image as defined in a
    JSON or YAML file.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Machine image resource - The machine image to set the IAM policy for. This
     represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the [project]
     attribute: provide the argument [machine_image] on the command line with a
     fully specified name; set the property [core/project]; provide the
     argument [--project] on the command line. This must be specified.

       MACHINE_IMAGE
          ID of the machine image or fully qualified identifier for the machine
          image.

     POLICY_FILE
        Path to a local JSON or YAML formatted file containing a valid policy.

        The output of the get-iam-policy command is a valid file, as is any
        JSON or YAML file conforming to the structure of a Policy
        (https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/Policy).

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the compute/alpha API. The full documentation for this
    API can be found at:
    https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/reference/latest/

EXAMPLES
    The following command reads an IAM policy defined in a policy.json file        and sets the policy for the machine image `my-image`:

        $ gcloud alpha compute machine-images set-iam-policy my-image \
            policy.json

    See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details of the
    policy file format and contents.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access whitelist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta compute machine-images set-iam-policy
