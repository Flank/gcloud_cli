DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Create Google Compute Engine machine images.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     IMAGE
        Name of the machineImage to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --source-instance=SOURCE_INSTANCE
        The source instance to create a machine image from.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --csek-key-file=FILE
        Path to a Customer-Supplied Encryption Key (CSEK) key file, mapping
        Google Compute Engine machine images to user managed keys to be used
        when creating, mounting, or snapshotting disks.

        If you pass - as value of the flag the CSEK will be read from stdin.
        See
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-supplied-encryption
        for more details.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Specifies a textual description of the machine image.

     --guest-flush
        Create an application-consistent machine image by informing the OS to
        prepare for the snapshot process. Currently only supported on Windows
        instances using the Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS).

     --require-csek-key-create
        Refuse to create machine images not protected by a user managed key in
        the key file when --csek-key-file is given. This behavior is enabled by
        default to prevent incorrect gcloud invocations from accidentally
        creating machine images with no user managed key. Disabling the check
        allows creation of some machine images without a matching
        Customer-Supplied Encryption Key in the supplied --csek-key-file. See
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-supplied-encryption
        for more details. Enabled by default, use --no-require-csek-key-create
        to disable.

     --source-disk-csek-key=[PROPERTY=VALUE,...]
        Customer-supplied encryption key of the disk attached to the source
        instance. Required if the source disk is protected by a
        customer-supplied encryption key. This flag may be repeated to specify
        multiple attached disks.

         disk
            URL of the disk attached to the source instance. This can be a full
            or valid partial URL

         csek-key-file
            path to customer-supplied encryption key.
     --source-disk-kms-key=[PROPERTY=VALUE,...]
        KMS encryption key of the disk attached to the source instance.
        Required if the source disk is protected by a KMS encryption key. This
        flag may be repeated to specify multiple attached disks.

         disk
            URL of the disk attached to the source instance. This can be a full
            or valid partial URL

         kms-key
            Fully qualified Cloud KMS cryptokey name that protects the disk.
            This can either be the fully qualified path or the name. The fully
            qualified Cloud KMS cryptokey name format is:
            projects/<kms-project>/locations/<kms-location>/keyRings/<kms-keyring>/
            cryptoKeys/<key-name>. If the value is not fully qualified then
            kms-location, kms-keyring, and optionally kms-project are required.
            See
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-managed-encryption
            for more details.

         kms-project
            Project that contains the Cloud KMS cryptokey that protects the
            disk. If the project is not specified then the project where the
            disk is being created will be used. If this flag is set then
            key-location, kms-keyring, and kms-key are required. See
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-managed-encryption
            for more details.

         kms-location
            Location of the Cloud KMS cryptokey to be used for protecting the
            disk. All Cloud KMS cryptokeys are reside in a 'location'. To get a
            list of possible locations run 'gcloud kms locations list'. If this
            flag is set then kms-keyring and kms-key are required. See
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-managed-encryption
            for more details.

         kms-keyring
            The keyring which contains the Cloud KMS cryptokey that will
            protect the disk. If this flag is set then kms-location and kms-key
            are required. See
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-managed-encryption
            for more details.

     --source-instance-zone=SOURCE_INSTANCE_ZONE
        Zone of the instance to operate on. If not specified and the
        compute/zone property isn't set, you may be prompted to select a zone.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

     --storage-location=LOCATION
        Google Cloud Storage location, either regional or multi-regional, where
        machine image's content is to be stored. If absent, a nearby regional
        or multi-regional location is chosen automatically.

     Key resource - The Cloud KMS (Key Management Service) cryptokey that will
     be used to protect the machine image. The arguments in this group can be
     used to specify the attributes of this resource.

       --kms-key=KMS_KEY
          ID of the key or fully qualified identifier for the key. This flag
          must be specified if any of the other arguments in this group are
          specified.

       --kms-keyring=KMS_KEYRING
          The KMS keyring of the key.

       --kms-location=KMS_LOCATION
          The Cloud location for the key.

       --kms-project=KMS_PROJECT
          The Cloud project for the key.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
    https://cloud.google.com/support/.
