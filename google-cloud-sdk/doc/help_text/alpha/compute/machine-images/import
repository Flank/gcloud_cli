DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute machine-images import creates Compute Engine
    machine image from virtual appliance in OVA/OVF format.

    Importing OVF involves:
      o Unpacking OVF package (if in OVA format) to Cloud Storage.
      o Import disks from OVF to Compute Engine.
      o Translate the boot disk to make it bootable in Compute Engine.
      o Create a machine image using OVF metadata and imported disks.

    Virtual instances, images, machine images, and disks in Compute engine and
    files stored on Cloud Storage incur charges. See
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/importing-virtual-disks#resource_cleanup.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     IMAGE
        Name of the machineImage to import.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --source-uri=SOURCE_URI
        Cloud Storage path to one of: OVF descriptor OVA file Directory with
        OVF package

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --can-ip-forward
        If provided, allows the VMs created from the imported machine image to
        send and receive packets with non-matching destination or source IP
        addresses.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Specifies a text description of the machine image.

     --guest-environment
        The guest environment will be installed on the machine image. Enabled
        by default, use --no-guest-environment to disable.

     --guest-flush
        Create an application-consistent machine image by informing the OS to
        prepare for the snapshot process. Currently only supported on Windows
        instances using the Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS).

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     --log-location=LOG_LOCATION
        Directory in Cloud Storage to hold build logs. If not set,
        gs://<project num>.cloudbuild-logs.googleusercontent.com/ is created
        and used.

     --machine-type=MACHINE_TYPE
        Specifies the machine type used for the instances. To get a list of
        available machine types, run 'gcloud compute machine-types list'. If
        unspecified, the default type is n1-standard-1.

     --network=NETWORK
        Specifies the network for the VMs that are created from the imported
        machine image. If --subnet is also specified, then the subnet must be a
        subnetwork of network specified by --network. If neither is specified,
        the default network is used.

     --network-tier=NETWORK_TIER
        Specifies the network tier that will be used to configure the machine
        image. NETWORK_TIER must be one of: PREMIUM, STANDARD. The default
        value is PREMIUM.

     --os=OS
        Specifies the OS of the machine image being imported. OS must be one
        of: centos-6, centos-7, centos-8, debian-8, debian-9, opensuse-15,
        rhel-6, rhel-6-byol, rhel-7, rhel-7-byol, rhel-8, rhel-8-byol,
        sles-12-byol, sles-15-byol, ubuntu-1404, ubuntu-1604, ubuntu-1804,
        ubuntu-2004, windows-10-x64-byol, windows-10-x86-byol, windows-2008r2,
        windows-2008r2-byol, windows-2012, windows-2012-byol, windows-2012r2,
        windows-2012r2-byol, windows-2016, windows-2016-byol, windows-2019,
        windows-2019-byol, windows-7-x64-byol, windows-7-x86-byol,
        windows-8-x64-byol, windows-8-x86-byol.

     --restart-on-failure
        The VMs created from the imported machine image are restarted if they
        are terminated by Compute Engine. This does not affect terminations
        performed by the user. Enabled by default, use --no-restart-on-failure
        to disable.

     --storage-location=LOCATION
        Google Cloud Storage location, either regional or multi-regional, where
        machine image's content is to be stored. If absent, a nearby regional
        or multi-regional location is chosen automatically.

     --subnet=SUBNET
        Specifies the subnet for the VMs created from the imported machine
        image. If --network is also specified, the subnet must be a subnetwork
        of the network specified by --network.

     --tags=TAG,[TAG,...]
        Specifies a list of tags to apply to the VMs created from the imported
        machine image. These tags allow network firewall rules and routes to be
        applied to specified VMs. See gcloud compute firewall-rules create(1)
        for more details.

        To read more about configuring network tags, read this guide:
        https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/add-remove-network-tags

        To list VMs with their respective status and tags, run:

            $ gcloud compute instances list \
                --format='table(name,status,tags.list())'

        To list VMs tagged with a specific tag, tag1, run:

            $ gcloud compute instances list --filter='tags:tag1'

     --timeout=TIMEOUT; default="2h"
        Maximum time an import can last before it fails as "TIMEOUT". For
        example, specifying 2h fails the process after 2 hours. See $ gcloud
        topic datetimes for information about duration formats.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the machine image to import. The zone in which to perform the
        import of the machine image. If not specified and the compute/zone
        property isn't set, you may be prompted to select a zone.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

     Custom machine type extensions.

       --custom-cpu=CUSTOM_CPU
          A whole number value indicating how many cores are desired in the
          custom machine type. This flag must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --custom-memory=CUSTOM_MEMORY
          A whole number value indicating how much memory is desired in the
          custom machine type. A size unit should be provided (eg. 3072MB or
          9GB) - if no units are specified, GB is assumed. This flag must be
          specified if any of the other arguments in this group are specified.

       --custom-extensions
          Use the extended custom machine type.

       --custom-vm-type=CUSTOM_VM_TYPE
          Specifies VM type. n1 - VMs with CPU platforms Skylake and older, n2
          - VMs with CPU platform Cascade Lake. n2 offers flexible sizing from
          2 to 80 vCPUs, and 1 to 640GBs of memory. It also features a number
          of performance enhancements including exposing a more accurate NUMA
          topology to the guest OS. The default is n1.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To import an OVF package from Cloud Storage into a machine image named
    my-machine-image, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute machine-images import my-machine-image \
            --source-uri=gs://my-bucket/my-dir

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta compute machine-images import
