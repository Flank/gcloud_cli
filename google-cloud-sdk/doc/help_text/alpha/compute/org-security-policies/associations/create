NAME
    gcloud alpha compute org-security-policies associations create - create a
        new association between a security policy and an organization or folder
        resource

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute org-security-policies associations create
        --security-policy=SECURITY_POLICY
        (--folder=FOLDER | --organization=ORGANIZATION) [--name=NAME]
        [--replace-association-on-target] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute org-security-policies associations create is
    used to create organization security policy associations. An organization
    security policy is a set of rules that controls access to various
    resources.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --security-policy=SECURITY_POLICY
        Security policy ID of the association.

     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --folder=FOLDER
          ID of the folder with which the association is created.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION
          ID of the organization with which the association is created.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --name=NAME
        Name to identify this association. If unspecified, the name will be set
        to "organization-{ORGANIZATION_ID}" or "folder-{FOLDER_ID}".

     --replace-association-on-target
        By default, if you attempt to insert an association to an organization
        or folder resource that is already associated with a security policy
        the method will fail. If this is set, the existing association will be
        deleted at the same time that the new association is created.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access whitelist.
