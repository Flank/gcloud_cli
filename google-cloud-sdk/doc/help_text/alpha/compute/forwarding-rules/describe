NAME
    gcloud alpha compute forwarding-rules describe - display detailed
        information about a forwarding rule

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute forwarding-rules describe NAME
        [--global | --region=REGION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute forwarding-rules describe displays all data
    associated with a forwarding rule in a project.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the forwarding rule to describe.

FLAGS
     At most one of these may be specified:

       --global
          If provided, it is assumed the forwarding rule is global.

       --region=REGION
          The region of the forwarding rule to describe. If not specified, you
          may be prompted to select a region.

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/region property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/region

          Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To get details about a global forwarding rule, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute forwarding-rules describe FORWARDING-RULE \
            --global

    To get details about a regional forwarding rule, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute forwarding-rules describe FORWARDING-RULE \
            --region us-central1
