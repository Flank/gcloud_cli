NAME
    gcloud alpha compute forwarding-rules import - import a forwarding rule

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute forwarding-rules import NAME [--source=SOURCE]
        [--global | --region=REGION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) If the specified forwarding rule already exists, it will be
    overwritten. Otherwise, a new forwarding rule will be created. To edit a
    forwarding rule you can export the forwarding rule to a file, edit its
    configuration, and then import the new configuration.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the forwarding rule to import.

FLAGS
     --source=SOURCE
        Path to a YAML file containing forwarding rule configuration export
        data. The YAML file must not contain any output-only fields.
        Alternatively, you may omit this flag to read from standard input. A
        schema describing the export/import format can be found in:
        $CLOUDSDKROOT/lib/googlecloudsdk/schemas/compute/alpha/ForwardingRule.yaml.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --global
          If set, the forwarding rule is global.

       --region=REGION
          Region of the forwarding rule to import. If not specified, you may be
          prompted to select a region.

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/region property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/region

          Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
