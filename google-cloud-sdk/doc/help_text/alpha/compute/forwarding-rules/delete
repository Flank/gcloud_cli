NAME
    gcloud alpha compute forwarding-rules delete - delete forwarding rules

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute forwarding-rules delete NAME [NAME ...]
        [--global | --region=REGION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute forwarding-rules delete deletes one or more
    Google Compute Engine forwarding rules.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME [NAME ...]
        Names of the forwarding rules to delete.

FLAGS
     At most one of these may be specified:

       --global
          If set, the forwarding rules are global.

       --region=REGION
          Region of the forwarding rules to delete. If not specified, you may
          be prompted to select a region.

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/region property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/region

          Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
    https://cloud.google.com/support/. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute forwarding-rules delete
        $ gcloud beta compute forwarding-rules delete
