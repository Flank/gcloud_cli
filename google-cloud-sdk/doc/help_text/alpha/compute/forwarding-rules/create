DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute forwarding-rules create is used to create a
    forwarding rule. A forwarding rule directs traffic that matches a bound IP
    address to a forwarding target (load balancer, VPN gateway or VM instance).

    Forwarding rules can be either global or regional, specified with the
    --global or --region=REGION flag. Global forwarding rules work with global
    load balancers, which include target HTTP proxies, target HTTPS proxies,
    target SSL proxies and target TCP proxies; regional forwarding rules work
    with regional or zonal targets, which include target pools, target
    instances and target VPN gateways and backend services.

    Forwarding rules can be either external or internal, specified with the
    --load-balancing-scheme=[EXTERNAL|INTERNAL] flag. External forwarding rules
    are accessible from the internet, while internal forwarding rules are only
    accessible from within their VPC networks. You can specify a reserved
    static external or internal IP address with the --address=ADDRESS flag for
    the forwarding rule. Otherwise if the flag is unspecified, an external
    forwaring rule will be automatically assigned an ephemeral external IP
    address (global IP addresses for global forwarding rules and regional IP
    addresses for regional forwarding rules); an internal forwarding rule will
    be automatically assigned an ephemeral internal IP address from the subnet
    specified with the --subnet flag.

    There are different types of load balancer working at different layers of
    the OSI networking model (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_layer).
    Layer 3 load balancer targets include target pools, target SSL proxies,
    target TCP proxies and backend services. Layer 7 load balancer targets
    include target HTTP proxies and target HTTPS proxies. For more information
    on load balancing, see
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing-and-autoscaling/.

    When creating a forwarding rule, exactly one of --target-instance,
    --target-pool, --target-http-proxy, --target-https-proxy,
    --target-ssl-proxy, --target-tcp-proxy, --target-vpn-gateway or
    --backend-service must be specified.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the forwarding rule to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --backend-service=BACKEND_SERVICE
          The target backend service that will receive the traffic.

       --target-http-proxy=TARGET_HTTP_PROXY
          The target HTTP proxy that will receive the traffic. Acceptable
          values for --ports flag are: 80, 8080.

       --target-https-proxy=TARGET_HTTPS_PROXY
          The target HTTPS proxy that will receive the traffic. Acceptable
          values for --ports flag are: 443.

       --target-instance=TARGET_INSTANCE
          The name of the target instance that will receive the traffic. The
          target instance must be in a zone that's in the forwarding rule's
          region. Global forwarding rules may not direct traffic to target
          instances. If not specified and the compute/zone property isn't set,
          you may be prompted to select a zone.

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/zone property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

          Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

       --target-pool=TARGET_POOL
          The target pool that will receive the traffic. The target pool must
          be in the same region as the forwarding rule. Global forwarding rules
          may not direct traffic to target pools.

       --target-ssl-proxy=TARGET_SSL_PROXY
          The target SSL proxy that will receive the traffic. Acceptable values
          for --ports flag are: 25, 43, 110, 143, 195, 443, 465, 587, 700, 993,
          995, 1883, 5222.

       --target-tcp-proxy=TARGET_TCP_PROXY
          The target TCP proxy that will receive the traffic. Acceptable values
          for --ports flag are: 25, 43, 110, 143, 195, 443, 465, 587, 700, 993,
          995, 1883, 5222.

       --target-vpn-gateway=TARGET_VPN_GATEWAY
          The target VPN gateway that will receive forwarded traffic.
          Acceptable values for --ports flag are: 500, 4500.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional textual description for the forwarding rule.

     --ip-protocol=IP_PROTOCOL
        The IP protocol that the rule will serve. The default is TCP.
        IP_PROTOCOL must be one of: AH, ESP, ICMP, SCTP, TCP, UDP.

     --load-balancing-scheme=LOAD_BALANCING_SCHEME; default="EXTERNAL"
        This signifies what the forwarding rule will be used for.
        LOAD_BALANCING_SCHEME must be one of:

         EXTERNAL
            External load balancing or forwarding, used with one of
            --target-http-proxy, --target-https-proxy, --target-tcp-proxy,
            --target-ssl-proxy, --target-pool, --target-vpn-gateway,
            --target-instance.
         INTERNAL
            Internal load balancing or forwarding, used with --backend-service.

     --network=NETWORK
        (Only for --load-balancing-scheme=INTERNAL) The network that this
        forwarding rule applies to. If this field is not specified, the default
        network will be used. In the absence of the default network, this field
        must be specified.

     --network-tier=NETWORK_TIER
        The network tier to assign to the forwarding rules. NETWORK_TIER must
        be one of: PREMIUM, STANDARD. The default value is PREMIUM.

     --service-label=SERVICE_LABEL
        (Only for Internal Load Balancing):
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/internal/ The DNS
        label to use as the prefix of the fully qualified domain name for this
        forwarding rule. The full name will be internally generated and output
        as dnsName. If this field is not specified, no DNS record will be
        generated and no DNS name will be output.

     --subnet=SUBNET
        (Only for --load-balancing-scheme=INTERNAL) The subnetwork that this
        forwarding rule applies to. If the network configured for this
        forwarding rule is in auto subnet mode, this flag is optional and the
        subnet in the same region of the forwarding rule will be used. However,
        if the network is in custom subnet mode, a subnetwork must be
        specified.

     --subnet-region=SUBNET_REGION
        The region of the subnetwork to operate on. If not specified it will be
        set the region of the forwarding rule. Overrides the default
        compute/region property value for this command invocation.

     --target-instance-zone=TARGET_INSTANCE_ZONE
        The zone of the target instance to operate on. Overrides the default
        compute/zone property value for this command invocation.

     --target-pool-region=TARGET_POOL_REGION
        The region of the target pool to operate on. If not specified it will
        be set the region of the forwarding rule. Overrides the default
        compute/region property value for this command invocation.

     --target-vpn-gateway-region=TARGET_VPN_GATEWAY_REGION
        The region of the VPN gateway to operate on. If not specified it will
        be set the region of the forwarding rule. Overrides the default
        compute/region property value for this command invocation.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --address=ADDRESS
          The IP address that the forwarding rule will serve. All traffic sent
          to this IP address is directed to the target pointed to by the
          forwarding rule. Assigned IP addresses can be reserved or unreserved.

          IP addresses are restricted based on the forwarding rule's load
          balancing scheme (EXTERNAL or INTERNAL) and scope (global or
          regional).

          When the --load-balancing-scheme is EXTERNAL, if the address is
          reserved, it must either (1) reside in the global scope if the
          forwarding rule is being configured to point to a global target
          (target HTTP proxy, target HTTPS proxy, target SSL proxy and target
          TCP proxy) or (2) reside in the same region as the forwarding rule if
          the forwarding rule is being configured to point to a regional target
          (target pool) or zonal target (target instance). If this flag is
          omitted, an ephemeral external IP address is automatically assigned.

          When the --load-balancing-scheme is INTERNAL, this can only be an RFC
          1918 IP address belonging to the network/subnet configured for the
          forwarding rule. If this flag is omitted, an ephemeral internal IP
          address will be automatically allocated from the IP range of the
          subnet or network configured for this forwarding rule.

          Note: An IP address must be specified if the traffic is being
          forwarded to a VPN.

          This flag can be specified either by a literal IP address or a
          reference to an existing Address resource. The following examples are
          all valid:
          + 100.1.2.3
          + https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project-1/regions/us-central1/addresses/address-1
          + projects/project-1/regions/us-central1/addresses/address-1
          + regions/us-central1/addresses/address-1
          + global/addresses/address-1
          + address-1

         --ip-version=IP_VERSION
            The version of the IP address to be allocated if no --address is
            given. The default is IPv4. IP_VERSION must be one of: IPV4, IPV6.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --address-region=ADDRESS_REGION
          The region of the address to operate on. If not specified, you may be
          prompted to select a region.

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/region property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/region

          Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

       --global-address
          If provided, it is assumed the address is global.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --backend-service-region=BACKEND_SERVICE_REGION
          The region of the backend service to operate on. If not specified it
          will be set the region of the forwarding rule. Overrides the default
          compute/region property value for this command invocation.

       --global-backend-service
          If provided, it is assumed the backend service is global.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --global
          If provided, it is assumed the forwarding rule is global.

       --region=REGION
          The region of the forwarding rule to create. If not specified, you
          may be prompted to select a region.

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/region property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/region

          Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --port-range=[PORT | START_PORT-END_PORT]
          DEPRECATED, use --ports. If specified, only packets addressed to
          ports in the specified range will be forwarded. If not specified for
          regional forwarding rules, all ports are matched. This flag is
          required for global forwarding rules.

          Either an individual port (--port-range 80) or a range of ports
          (--port-range 3000-3100) may be specified.

       --ports=[PORT | START_PORT-END_PORT],[...]
          If specified, only packets addressed to ports in the specified list
          will be forwarded. If not specified for regional forwarding rules,
          all ports are matched. This flag is required for global forwarding
          rules and accepts a single continuous set of ports.

          Some forwarding targets have restriction on acceptable ports, e.g.,
          if --target-http-proxy is specified, the acceptable values for
          --ports are: 80, 8080.

          Individual ports and ranges can be specified, for example (--ports
          8000-8004 or --ports 80).

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To create a global forwarding rule that will forward all traffic on port
    8080 for IP address ADDRESS to a target http proxy PROXY, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute forwarding-rules create RULE_NAME --global \
            --target-http-proxy PROXY --ports 8080 --address ADDRESS

    To create a regional forwarding rule for the subnet SUBNET_NAME on the
    default network that will forward all traffic on ports 80-82 to a backend
    service SERVICE_NAME, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute forwarding-rules create RULE_NAME \
            --load-balancing-scheme INTERNAL \
            --backend-service SERVICE_NAME --subnet SUBNET_NAME \
            --network default --region REGION --ports 80-82
