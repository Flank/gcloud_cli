DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute disks create creates one or more Google
    Compute Engine persistent disks. When creating virtual machine instances,
    disks can be attached to the instances through the gcloud compute instances
    create command. Disks can also be attached to instances that are already
    running using gcloud compute instances attach-disk.

    Disks are zonal resources, so they reside in a particular zone for their
    entire lifetime. The contents of a disk can be moved to a different zone by
    snapshotting the disk (using gcloud compute disks snapshot) and creating a
    new disk using --source-snapshot in the desired zone. The contents of a
    disk can also be moved across project or zone by creating an image (using
    gcloud compute images create) and creating a new disk using --image in the
    desired project and/or zone.

    When creating disks, be sure to include the --zone option:

        $ gcloud alpha compute disks create my-disk-1 my-disk-2 \
            --zone us-east1-a

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     DISK_NAME [DISK_NAME ...]
        Names of the disks to create.

FLAGS
     --csek-key-file=FILE
        Path to a Customer-Supplied Encryption Key (CSEK) key file, mapping
        Google Compute Engine resources to user managed keys to be used when
        creating, mounting, or snapshotting disks.

        If you pass - as value of the flag the CSEK will be read from stdin.
        See
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-supplied-encryption
        for more details.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional, textual description for the disks being created.

     --guest-os-features=[GUEST_OS_FEATURE,...]
        This parameter enables one or more features for VM instances that use
        the image for their boot disks. The following features are available:

        * MULTI_IP_SUBNET - For configuring interfaces with a netmask other
          than /32.

        * SECURE_BOOT - Enables UEFI secure boot, which restrics unsigned
          software from booting or unsigned drivers from loading on the VM
          instance.

        * UEFI_COMPATIBLE - Enables UEFI booting, which is an alternative
          system boot method. Most public images use the GRUB bootloader as
          their primary boot method.

        * VIRTIO_SCSI_MULTIQUEUE - Enables multiqueue SCSI capabilities for
          Local SSD devices. This option is an alternative to NVMe.
          + For Linux images, you can enable VIRTIO_SCSI_MULTIQUEUE on images
            with kernel versions 3.17 and higher.
          + For Windows images, you can enable VIRTIO_SCSI_MULTIQUEUE on
            images with driver version 1.2.0.1621 or higher.

        * WINDOWS - Required for Windows Server images. Newer public images
          for Windows server include the WINDOWS parameter to indicate that it
          is a Windows image.

    GUEST_OS_FEATURE must be one of: MULTI_IP_SUBNET, SECURE_BOOT,
    UEFI_COMPATIBLE, VIRTIO_SCSI_MULTIQUEUE, WINDOWS.

     --kms-key=KMS_KEY
        The Cloud KMS (Key Management Service) cryptokey that will be used to
        protect the disk.

        This can either be the fully qualified path or the name.

        The fully qualified Cloud KMS cryptokey has the format:
        projects/<project-id>/locations/<location>/keyRings/<ring-name>/
        cryptoKeys/<key-name>

        If the value is not fully qualified then --kms-location and
        --kms-keyring are required. For keys in a different project use
        --kms-project.

        See
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-managed-encryption
        for more details.

     --kms-keyring=KMS_KEYRING
        The name of the keyring which contains the Cloud KMS cryptokey that
        will protect the disk.

        If this flag is set then --kms-location and --kms-key are required.

        See
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-managed-encryption
        for more details.

     --kms-location=KMS_LOCATION
        Location of the Cloud KMS cryptokey to be used for protecting the disk.

        All Cloud KMS cryptokeys reside in a 'location'. To get a list of
        possible locations run 'gcloud kms locations list'.

        If this flag is set then --kms-keyring and --kms-key are required.

        See
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-managed-encryption
        for more details.

     --kms-project=KMS_PROJECT
        Project that contains the Cloud KMS cryptokey that will protect the
        disk.

        If the project is not specified then the project where the disk is
        being created will be used.

        If this flag is set then --key-location, --kms-keyring, and --kms-key
        are required.

        See
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-managed-encryption
        for more details.

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        A list of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

     --licenses=[LICENSE,...]
        A list of URIs to license resources. The provided licenses will be
        added onto the created disks to indicate the licensing and billing
        policies.

     --replica-zones=ZONE,ZONE
        A comma-separated list of exactly 2 zones that a regional disk will be
        replicated to. Required when creating regional disk. The zones must be
        in the same region as specified in the --region flag. See available
        zones with gcloud compute zones list.

     --require-csek-key-create
        Refuse to create resources not protected by a user managed key in the
        key file when --csek-key-file is given. This behavior is enabled by
        default to prevent incorrect gcloud invocations from accidentally
        creating resources with no user managed key. Disabling the check allows
        creation of some resources without a matching Customer-Supplied
        Encryption Key in the supplied --csek-key-file. See
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-supplied-encryption
        for more details. Enabled by default, use --no-require-csek-key-create
        to disable.

     --resource-policies=[RESOURCE_POLICY,...]
        A list of resource policy names to be added to the instance. The
        policies must exist in the same region as the instance.

     --size=SIZE
        Indicates the size of the disks. The value must be a whole number
        followed by a size unit of GB for gigabyte, or TB for terabyte. If no
        size unit is specified, GB is assumed. For example, 10GB will produce
        10 gigabyte disks. Disk size must be a multiple of 1 GB.

     --type=TYPE
        Specifies the type of disk to create. To get a list of available disk
        types, run gcloud compute disk-types list. The default disk type is
        pd-standard.

     --image-project=IMAGE_PROJECT
        The project against which all image and image family references will be
        resolved. It is best practice to define image-project.
        * If specifying one of our public images, image-project must be
          provided.
        * If there are several of the same image-family value in multiple
          projects, image-project must be specified to clarify the image to be
          used.
        * If not specified and either image or image-family is provided, the
          current default project is used.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --image=IMAGE
          An image to apply to the disks being created. When using this option,
          the size of the disks must be at least as large as the image size.
          Use --size to adjust the size of the disks.

          This flag is mutually exclusive with --source-snapshot and
          --image-family.

       --image-family=IMAGE_FAMILY
          The family of the image that the boot disk will be initialized with.
          When a family is used instead of an image, the latest non-deprecated
          image associated with that family is used.

       --source-snapshot=SOURCE_SNAPSHOT
          A source snapshot used to create the disks. It is safe to delete a
          snapshot after a disk has been created from the snapshot. In such
          cases, the disks will no longer reference the deleted snapshot. To
          get a list of snapshots in your current project, run gcloud compute
          snapshots list. A snapshot from an existing disk can be created using
          the gcloud compute disks snapshot command. This flag is mutually
          exclusive with --image.

          When using this option, the size of the disks must be at least as
          large as the snapshot size. Use --size to adjust the size of the
          disks.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --region=REGION
          The region of the disks to create. If not specified, you may be
          prompted to select a region.

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/region property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/region

          Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

       --zone=ZONE
          The zone of the disks to create. If not specified and the
          compute/zone property isn't set, you may be prompted to select a
          zone.

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/zone property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

          Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.
