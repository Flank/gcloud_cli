NAME
    gcloud alpha compute disks describe - describe a Google Compute Engine disk

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute disks describe DISK_NAME
        [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute disks describe displays all data associated
    with a Google Compute Engine disk in a project.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     DISK_NAME
        Name of the disk to describe.

FLAGS
     At most one of these may be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the disk to describe. If not specified, you may be prompted
          to select a region.

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/region property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/region

          Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the disk to describe. If not specified and the compute/zone
          property isn't set, you may be prompted to select a zone.

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/zone property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

          Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
    https://cloud.google.com/support/. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute disks describe
        $ gcloud beta compute disks describe
