NAME
    gcloud alpha compute disks move - move a disk between zones

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute disks move DISK_NAME
        --destination-zone=DESTINATION_ZONE [--async] [--zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute disks move facilitates moving a Google Compute
    Engine disk volume from one zone to another. You cannot move a disk if it
    is attached to a running or stopped instance; use the gcloud compute
    instances move command instead.

    For example, running:

        $ gcloud compute disks move example-disk-1 --zone us-central1-b \
           --destination-zone us-central1-f

    will move the disk called example-disk-1, currently running in
    us-central1-b, to us-central1-f.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     DISK_NAME
        The name of the disk to operate on.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --destination-zone=DESTINATION_ZONE
        The zone to move the disk to.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Display information about the operation in progress, without waiting
        for the operation to complete.

     --zone=ZONE
        The zone of the disk to operate on. If not specified and the
        compute/zone property isn't set, you may be prompted to select a zone.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.
