NAME
    gcloud alpha compute disks delete - delete Google Compute Engine persistent
        disks

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute disks delete DISK_NAME [DISK_NAME ...] [--zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute disks delete deletes one or more Google
    Compute Engine persistent disks. Disks can be deleted only if they are not
    being used by any virtual machine instances.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     DISK_NAME [DISK_NAME ...]
        The names of the disks to delete.

FLAGS
     --zone=ZONE
        The zone of the disks to delete. If not specified and the compute/zone
        property isn't set, you will be prompted to select a zone.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

    users of ALPHA commands and flags need to apply for access, agree to
    applicable terms, and have their projects whitelisted. Contact Google or
