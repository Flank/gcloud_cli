NAME
    gcloud alpha compute disks remove-resource-policies - remove resource
        policies from a Google Compute Engine disk

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute disks remove-resource-policies DISK_NAME
        --resource-policies=[RESOURCE_POLICY,...] [--zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute disks remove-resource-policies removes
    resource policies from a Google Compute Engine virtual disk.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     DISK_NAME
        Name of the disk to remove resource policies from.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --resource-policies=[RESOURCE_POLICY,...]
        A list of resource policy names to be removed from the instance. The
        policies must exist in the same region as the instance.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --zone=ZONE
        The zone of the disk to remove resource policies from. If not specified
        and the compute/zone property isn't set, you may be prompted to select
        a zone.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.
