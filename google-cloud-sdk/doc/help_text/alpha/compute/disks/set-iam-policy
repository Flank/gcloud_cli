NAME
    gcloud alpha compute disks set-iam-policy - set IAM policy for a disk

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute disks set-iam-policy DISK_NAME POLICY_FILE
        [--zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute disks set-iam-policy replaces the existing IAM
    policy for a disk, given a disk and a file encoded in JSON or YAML that
    contains the IAM policy. If the given policy file specifies an "etag"
    value, then the replacement will succeed only if the policy already in
    place matches that etag. (An etag obtained via get-iam-policy will prevent
    the replacement if the policy for the disk has been subsequently updated.)
    A policy file that does not contain an etag value will replace any existing
    policy for the disk.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     DISK_NAME
        Name of the disk to set the IAM policy of.

     POLICY_FILE
        JSON or YAML file containing the IAM policy.

FLAGS
     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the disk to set the IAM policy of. If not specified and the
        compute/zone property isn't set, you may be prompted to select a zone.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    The following command will read an IAM policy defined in a JSON file
    'policy.json' and set it for a disk with identifier 'my-disk'

        $ gcloud alpha compute disks set-iam-policy my-disk policy.json

    See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details of the
    policy file format and contents.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
    https://cloud.google.com/support/. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta compute disks set-iam-policy
