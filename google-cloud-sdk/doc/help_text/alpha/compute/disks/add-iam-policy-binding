NAME
    gcloud alpha compute disks add-iam-policy-binding - add IAM policy binding
        to a Google Compute Engine disk

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute disks add-iam-policy-binding (DISK : --zone=ZONE)
        --member=MEMBER --role=ROLE
        [--condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          | --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Add an IAM policy binding to the IAM policy of a Google Compute
    Engine disk. One binding consists of a member, a role, and an optional
    condition.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Disk resource - The disk for which to add IAM policy binding to. The
     arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways. To set the [project] attribute: provide the
     argument [disk] on the command line with a fully specified name; set the
     property [core/project]; provide the argument [--project] on the command
     line. This must be specified.

       DISK
          ID of the disk or fully qualified identifier for the disk. This
          positional must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
          group are specified.

       --zone=ZONE
          The name of the Google Compute Engine zone.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --member=MEMBER
        The member to add the binding for. Should be of the form
        user|group|serviceAccount:email or domain:domain.

        Examples: user:test-user@gmail.com, group:admins@example.com,
        serviceAccount:test123@example.domain.com, or
        domain:example.domain.com.

        Can also be one of the following special values:
        * allUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone who is on the
          internet, with or without a Google account.
        * allAuthenticatedUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone
          who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account.

     --role=ROLE
        Define the role of the member.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     At most one of these may be specified:

       --condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          Condition of the binding to be added. When condition is explicitly
          specified as None (e.g. --condition=None), a binding without a
          condition is added. When --condition is specified and is not a None
          condition, --role cannot be a primitive role. Primitive roles are
          roles/editor, roles/owner, and roles/viewer.

       expression
          (Required) Expression of the condition which evaluates to True or
          False. This uses a subset of Common Expression Language syntax.

       title
          (Required) Title for the expression, i.e. a short string describing
          its purpose.

       description
          (Optional) Description for the expression. This is a longer text
          which describes the expression.

          NOTE: An unsatisfied condition will not allow access via this
          binding.

       --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE
          Path to a local JSON or YAML file that defines the condition. To see
          available fields, see the help for --condition.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the compute/alpha API. The full documentation for this
    API can be found at:

EXAMPLES
    To add an IAM policy binding for the role of 'roles/compute.securityAdmin'
    for the user 'test-user@gmail.com' with disk 'my-disk' and zone 'ZONE',
    run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute disks add-iam-policy-binding my-disk \
            --zone=ZONE --member='user:test-user@gmail.com' \
            --role='roles/compute.securityAdmin'

    To add an IAM policy binding which expires at the end of the year 2018 for
    the role of 'roles/compute.securityAdmin' and the user
    'test-user@gmail.com' with disk 'my-disk' and zone 'ZONE', run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute disks add-iam-policy-binding my-disk \
            --zone=ZONE --member='user:test-user@gmail.com' \
            --role='roles/compute.securityAdmin' \
            --condition='expression=request.time <
         timestamp("2019-01-01T00:00:00Z"),title=expires_end_of_2018,descrip\
        tion=Expires at midnight on 2018-12-31'

    See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details of

    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access whitelist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute disks add-iam-policy-binding
        $ gcloud beta compute disks add-iam-policy-binding
