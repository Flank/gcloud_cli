NAME
    gcloud alpha compute target-vpn-gateways create - create a target VPN
        Gateway

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute target-vpn-gateways create NAME --network=NETWORK
        [--description=DESCRIPTION] [--region=REGION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute target-vpn-gateways create is used to create a
    target VPN Gateway. A target VPN Gateway can reference one or more VPN
    tunnels that connect it to external VPN gateways. A VPN Gateway may also be
    referenced by one or more forwarding rules that define which packets the
    gateway is responsible for routing.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        The name of the Target VPN Gateway to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --network=NETWORK
        A reference to a network in this project to contain the VPN Gateway.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional, textual description for the target VPN Gateway.

     --region=REGION
        The region of the Target VPN Gateway to create. If not specified, you
        will be prompted to select a region.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.
