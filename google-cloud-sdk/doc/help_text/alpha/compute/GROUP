NAME
    gcloud alpha compute - create and manipulate Google Compute Engine
        resources

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute GROUP | COMMAND [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) The gcloud compute command group lets you create, configure and
    manipulate Google Compute Engine virtual machines.

    With Compute Engine you can create and run virtual machines on Google
    infrastructure. Compute Engine offers scale, performance, and value that
    allows you to easily launch large compute clusters on Google's
    infrastructure.

    More information on Compute Engine can be found here:
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/ and detailed documentation can be found
    here: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.
