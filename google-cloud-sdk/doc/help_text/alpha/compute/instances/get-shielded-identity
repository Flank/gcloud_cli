NAME
    gcloud alpha compute instances get-shielded-identity - get the Shielded
        identity for a Google Compute Engine instance

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute instances get-shielded-identity INSTANCE_NAME
        [--zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute instances get-shielded-identity displays the
    Shielded identity associated with a Google Compute Engine instance in a
    project.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAME
        Name of the instance to describe the Shielded identity of.

FLAGS
     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the instance to describe the Shielded identity of. If not
        specified, the user may be prompted to select a zone. gcloud will
        attempt to identify the zone by searching for resources in the user's
        project. If the zone cannot be determined, the user will then be
        prompted with all Google Cloud Platform zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, the user can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access whitelist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute instances get-shielded-identity
        $ gcloud beta compute instances get-shielded-identity
