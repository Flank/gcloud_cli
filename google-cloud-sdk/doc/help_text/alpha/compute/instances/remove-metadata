NAME
    gcloud alpha compute instances remove-metadata - remove instance metadata

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute instances remove-metadata INSTANCE_NAME [--zone=ZONE]
        [--all | --keys=KEY,[KEY,...]] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute instances remove-metadata can be used to
    remove instance metadata entries.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAME
        Name of the instance to set metadata on.

FLAGS
     --zone=ZONE
        The zone of the instance to set metadata on. If not specified, you may
        be prompted to select a zone. gcloud will attempt to identify the zone
        by searching for resources in your project. If the zone cannot be
        determined, you will then be prompted with all Google Cloud Platform
        zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --all
          If provided, all metadata entries are removed.

       --keys=KEY,[KEY,...]
          The keys of the entries to remove.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.
