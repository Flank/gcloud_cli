NAME
    gcloud alpha compute instances detach-disk - detach disks from Compute
        Engine virtual machine instances

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute instances detach-disk INSTANCE_NAME
        (--device-name=DEVICE_NAME | --disk=DISK)
        [--disk-scope=DISK_SCOPE; default="zonal"] [--zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute instances detach-disk is used to detach disks
    from virtual machines.

    Detaching a disk without first unmounting it may result in incomplete I/O
    operations and data corruption. To unmount a persistent disk on a
    Linux-based image, ssh into the instance and run:

        $ sudo umount /dev/disk/by-id/google-DEVICE_NAME

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAME
        Name of the instance to operate on.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --device-name=DEVICE_NAME
          Specifies a disk to detach by its device name, which is the name that
          the guest operating system sees. The device name is set at the time
          that the disk is attached to the instance, and needs not be the same
          as the persistent disk name. If the disk's device name is specified,
          then its persistent disk name must not be specified using the --disk
          flag.

       --disk=DISK
          Specifies a disk to detach by its resource name. If you specify a
          disk to remove by persistent disk name, then you must not specify its
          device name using the --device-name flag.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --disk-scope=DISK_SCOPE; default="zonal"
        The scope of the disk. DISK_SCOPE must be one of:

         regional
            The disk specified in --disk is interpreted as a regional disk in
            the same region as the instance. Ignored if a full URI is provided
            to the --disk flag.
         zonal
            The disk specified in --disk is interpreted as a zonal disk in the
            same zone as the instance. Ignored if a full URI is provided to the
            --disk flag.

     --zone=ZONE
        The zone of the instance to operate on. If not specified, you may be
        prompted to select a zone. gcloud will attempt to identify the zone by
        searching for resources in your project. If the zone cannot be
        determined, you will then be prompted with all Google Cloud Platform
        zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. Usually,
    users of ALPHA commands and flags need to apply for access, agree to
    applicable terms, and have their projects whitelisted. Contact Google or
    sign up on a product's page for ALPHA access. Product pages can be found at
