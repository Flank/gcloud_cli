NAME
    gcloud alpha compute instances remove-maintenance-policies - removes
        maintenance policies to Google Compute Engine VM instances

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute instances remove-maintenance-policies INSTANCE_NAME
        --resource-maintenance-policies=RESOURCE_MAINTENANCE_POLICIES
        [--zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute instances remove-maintenance-policies removes
    maintenance policies from Google Compute Engine virtual instances.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAME
        The name of the instance to remove maintenance policies from.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --resource-maintenance-policies=RESOURCE_MAINTENANCE_POLICIES
        Name of a maintenance policy to be removed from the instance. The
        policy must exist in the same region as the instance.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --zone=ZONE
        The zone of the instance to remove maintenance policies from. If not
        specified, you may be prompted to select a zone. gcloud will attempt to
        identify the zone by searching for resources in your project. If the
        zone cannot be determined, you will then be prompted with all Google
        Cloud Platform zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. Usually,
    users of ALPHA commands and flags need to apply for access, agree to
    applicable terms, and have their projects whitelisted. Contact Google or
