NAME
    gcloud alpha compute instances describe - describe a virtual machine
        instance

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute instances describe INSTANCE_NAME
        [--guest-attributes=[GUEST_ATTRIBUTE_KEY,...]] [--zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute instances describe displays all data
    associated with a Google Compute Engine virtual machine instance.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAME
        Name of the instance to describe.

FLAGS
     --guest-attributes=[GUEST_ATTRIBUTE_KEY,...]
        Instead of instance resource display guest attributes of the instance
        stored with the given keys.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the instance to describe. If not specified, you may be prompted
        to select a zone. gcloud will attempt to identify the zone by searching
        for resources in your project. If the zone cannot be determined, you
        will then be prompted with all Google Cloud Platform zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
    https://cloud.google.com/support/. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute instances describe
        $ gcloud beta compute instances describe
