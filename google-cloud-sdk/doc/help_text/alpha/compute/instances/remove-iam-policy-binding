NAME
    gcloud alpha compute instances remove-iam-policy-binding - remove IAM
        policy binding for an instance

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute instances remove-iam-policy-binding INSTANCE_NAME
        --member=MEMBER --role=ROLE [--zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute instances remove-iam-policy-binding removes an
    IAM policy binding from a Google Compute Engine instance's access policy.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAME
        Name of the instance to remove the IAM policy binding from.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --member=MEMBER
        The member to remove the binding for. Should be of the form
        user|group|serviceAccount:email or domain:domain.

        Examples: user:test-user@gmail.com, group:admins@example.com,
        serviceAccount:my-sa@test-123.iam.gserviceaccount.com, or
        domain:example.com.

        Can also be one of the following special values:
        * allUsers - anyone who is on the internet, with or without a Google
          account.
        * allAuthenticatedUsers - anyone who is authenticated with a Google
          account or a service account.

     --role=ROLE
        The role to remove the member from.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --zone=ZONE
        The zone of the instance to remove the IAM policy binding from. If not
        specified, you may be prompted to select a zone. gcloud will attempt to
        identify the zone by searching for resources in your project. If the
        zone cannot be determined, you will then be prompted with all Google
        Cloud Platform zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    The following command will remove an IAM policy binding for the role of
    'roles/compute.securityAdmin' for the user 'test-user@gmail.com' on
    instance with identifier 'my-instance'

        $ gcloud alpha compute instances remove-iam-policy-binding \
            my-instance --member='user:test-user@gmail.com' \
            --role='roles/compute.securityAdmin'

    The following command will remove an IAM policy binding for the role of
    'roles/compute.securityAdmin' from all authenticated users on instance
    'my-instance':

        $ gcloud alpha compute instances remove-iam-policy-binding \
            my-instance --member='allAuthenticatedUsers' \
            --role='roles/compute.securityAdmin'

    See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details of
    policy role and member types.
