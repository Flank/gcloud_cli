NAME
    gcloud alpha compute instances add-resource-policies - add resource
        policies to Google Compute Engine VM instances

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute instances add-resource-policies INSTANCE_NAME
        --resource-policies=[RESOURCE_POLICY,...] [--zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute instances add-resource-policies adds resource
    policies to Google Compute Engine virtual instances. These policies define
    time windows in which live migrations take place.

    For information on how to create resource policies, see:

        $ gcloud alpha compute resource-policies create --help

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAME
        Name of the instance to add resource policies to.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --resource-policies=[RESOURCE_POLICY,...]
        A list of resource policy names to be added to the instance. The
        policies must exist in the same region as the instance.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --zone=ZONE
        The zone of the instance to add resource policies to. If not specified,
        you may be prompted to select a zone. gcloud will attempt to identify
        the zone by searching for resources in your project. If the zone cannot
        be determined, you will then be prompted with all Google Cloud Platform
        zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.
