NAME
    gcloud alpha compute instances get-shielded-vm-identity - get the
        Shielded-VM identity for a Google Compute Engine instance

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute instances get-shielded-vm-identity INSTANCE_NAME
        [--zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute instances get-shielded-vm-identity displays
    the Shielded-VM identity associated with a Google Compute Engine instance
    in a project.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAME
        Name of the instance to describe the Shielded-VM identity of.

FLAGS
     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the instance to describe the Shielded-VM identity of. If not
        specified, you may be prompted to select a zone. gcloud will attempt to
        identify the zone by searching for resources in your project. If the
        zone cannot be determined, you will then be prompted with all Google
        Cloud Platform zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
