NAME
    gcloud alpha compute instances tail-serial-port-output - periodically fetch
        new output from a virtual machine instance's serial port and display it
        as it becomes available

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute instances tail-serial-port-output INSTANCE_NAME
        [--port=PORT] [--zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute instances tail-serial-port-output is used to
    tail the output from a Google Compute Engine virtual machine instance's
    serial port. The serial port output from the instance will be printed to
    standard output. This information can be useful for diagnostic purposes.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAME
        Name of the instance to operate on.

FLAGS
     --port=PORT
        Instances can support up to four serial port outputs, numbered 1
        through 4. By default, this command will return the output of the first
        serial port. Setting this flag will return the output of the requested
        serial port.

     --zone=ZONE
        The zone of the instance to operate on. If not specified, you may be
        prompted to select a zone. gcloud will attempt to identify the zone by
        searching for resources in your project. If the zone cannot be
        determined, you will then be prompted with all Google Cloud Platform
        zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. Usually,
    users of ALPHA commands and flags need to apply for access, agree to
    applicable terms, and have their projects whitelisted. Contact Google or
    sign up on a product's page for ALPHA access. Product pages can be found at
