NAME
    gcloud alpha compute instances network-interfaces update - update a Google
        Compute Engine virtual machine network interface

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute instances network-interfaces update INSTANCE_NAME
        [--aliases=ALIASES]
        [--network-interface=NETWORK_INTERFACE; default="nic0"] [--zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute instances network-interfaces update updates
    network interfaces of a Google Compute Engine virtual machine. For example:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instances network-interfaces update \
            example-instance --zone us-central1-a --aliases r1:172.16.0.1/32

    sets 172.16.0.1/32 from range r1 of the default interface's subnetwork as
    the interface's alias IP.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAME
        Name of the instance to operate on.

FLAGS
     --aliases=ALIASES
        The IP alias ranges to allocate for this interface. If there are
        multiple IP alias ranges, they are separated by semicolons.

        For example:

            --aliases="10.128.1.0/24;r1:/32"

     --network-interface=NETWORK_INTERFACE; default="nic0"
        The name of the network interface to update.

     --zone=ZONE
        The zone of the instance to operate on. If not specified, you may be
        prompted to select a zone. gcloud will attempt to identify the zone by
        searching for resources in your project. If the zone cannot be
        determined, you will then be prompted with all Google Cloud Platform
        zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. Usually,
    users of ALPHA commands and flags need to apply for access, agree to
    applicable terms, and have their projects whitelisted. Contact Google or
    sign up on a product's page for ALPHA access. Product pages can be found at
