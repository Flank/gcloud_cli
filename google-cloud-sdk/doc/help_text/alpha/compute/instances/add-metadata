NAME
    gcloud alpha compute instances add-metadata - add or update instance
        metadata

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute instances add-metadata INSTANCE_NAME
        [--metadata=KEY=VALUE,[KEY=VALUE,...]]
        [--metadata-from-file=KEY=LOCAL_FILE_PATH,[...]] [--zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute instances add-metadata can be used to add or
    update the metadata of a virtual machine instance. Every instance has
    access to a metadata server that can be used to query metadata that has
    been set through this tool. For information on metadata, see
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/metadata

    Only metadata keys that are provided are mutated. Existing metadata entries
    will remain unaffected.

    In order to retrieve custom metadata, run:

        $ gcloud compute instances describe example-instance --zone
        us-central1-a --format='value(metadata)'

    where example-instance is the name of the virtual machine instance you're
    querying custom metadata from. For more information about querying custom
    instance or project metadata through the Cloud Platform Console or the API,
    see
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/storing-retrieving-metadata#querying_custom_metadata

    If you are using this command to manage SSH keys for your project, please
    note the risks
    (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/adding-removing-ssh-keys#risks)
    of manual SSH key management as well as the required format for SSH key
    metadata, available at
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/adding-removing-ssh-keys

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAME
        Name of the instance to set metadata on.

FLAGS
     --metadata=KEY=VALUE,[KEY=VALUE,...]
        Metadata to be made available to the guest operating system running on
        the instances. Each metadata entry is a key/value pair separated by an
        equals sign. Metadata keys must be unique and less than 128 bytes in
        length. Values must be less than or equal to 32,768 bytes in length.
        Multiple arguments can be passed to this flag, e.g., --metadata
        key-1=value-1,key-2=value-2,key-3=value-3.

        In images that have Compute Engine tools installed on them, such as the
        official images (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images), the
        following metadata keys have special meanings:

         startup-script
            Specifies a script that will be executed by the instances once they
            start running. For convenience, --metadata-from-file can be used to
            pull the value from a file.

         startup-script-url
            Same as startup-script except that the script contents are pulled
            from a publicly-accessible location on the web.

    At least one of [--metadata] or [--metadata-from-file] is required.

     --metadata-from-file=KEY=LOCAL_FILE_PATH,[...]
        Same as --metadata except that the value for the entry will be read
        from a local file. This is useful for values that are too large such as
        startup-script contents.

    At least one of [--metadata] or [--metadata-from-file] is required.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the instance to set metadata on. If not specified, you may be
        prompted to select a zone. gcloud will attempt to identify the zone by
        searching for resources in your project. If the zone cannot be
        determined, you will then be prompted with all Google Cloud Platform
        zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
    https://cloud.google.com/support/. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute instances add-metadata
        $ gcloud beta compute instances add-metadata
