NAME
    gcloud alpha compute instances update - update a Google Compute Engine
        virtual machine

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute instances update INSTANCE_NAME
        [--[no-]deletion-protection] [--min-cpu-platform=PLATFORM]
        [--[no-]shielded-vm-integrity-monitoring]
        [--shielded-vm-learn-integrity-policy] [--[no-]shielded-vm-secure-boot]
        [--[no-]shielded-vm-vtpm] [--update-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]]
        [--zone=ZONE] [--clear-labels | --remove-labels=[KEY,...]]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute instances update updates labels and requested
    CPU Platform for a Google Compute Engine virtual machine. For example:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instances update example-instance \
            --zone us-central1-a --update-labels=k0=value1,k1=value2 \
            --remove-labels=k3

    will add/update labels k0 and k1 and remove labels with key k3.

    Labels can be used to identify the instance and to filter them as in

        $ gcloud alpha compute instances list --filter='labels.k1:value2'

    To list existing labels

        $ gcloud alpha compute instances describe example-instance \
            --format='default(labels)'

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAME
        Name of the instance to update.

FLAGS
     --[no-]deletion-protection
        Enables deletion protection for the instance. Use --deletion-protection
        to enable and --no-deletion-protection to disable.

     --min-cpu-platform=PLATFORM
        When specified, the VM will be scheduled on host with specified CPU
        architecture or a newer one. To list available CPU platforms in given
        zone, run:

            $ gcloud alpha compute zones describe ZONE \
              --format="value(availableCpuPlatforms)"

        Default setting is "AUTOMATIC".

        CPU platform selection is available only in selected zones.

        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/specify-min-cpu-platform

     --[no-]shielded-vm-integrity-monitoring
        Enables monitoring and attestation of the boot integrity of the
        instance. The attestation is performed against the integrity policy
        baseline. This baseline is initially derived from the implicitly
        trusted boot image when the instance is created. This baseline can be
        updated by using --shielded-vm-learn-integrity-policy. Changes to this
        setting (via the update command) will only take effect after stopping
        and starting the instance. Use --shielded-vm-integrity-monitoring to
        enable and --no-shielded-vm-integrity-monitoring to disable.

     --shielded-vm-learn-integrity-policy
        Causes the instance to re-learn the integrity policy baseline using the
        current instance configuration. Use this flag after any planned
        boot-specific changes in the instance configuration, like kernel
        updates or kernel driver installation.

     --[no-]shielded-vm-secure-boot
        The instance will boot with secure boot enabled. Changes to this
        setting (via the update command) will only take effect after stopping
        and starting the instance. Use --shielded-vm-secure-boot to enable and
        --no-shielded-vm-secure-boot to disable.

     --[no-]shielded-vm-vtpm
        The instance will boot with the TPM (Trusted Platform Module) enabled.
        A TPM is a hardware module that can be used for different security
        operations such as remote attestation, encryption and sealing of keys.
        Changes to this setting (via the update command) will only take effect
        after stopping and starting the instance. Use --shielded-vm-vtpm to
        enable and --no-shielded-vm-vtpm to disable.

     --update-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        A list of label KEY=VALUE pairs to update. If a label exists its value
        is modified, otherwise a new label is created.

     --zone=ZONE
        The zone of the instance to update. If not specified, you may be
        prompted to select a zone. gcloud will attempt to identify the zone by
        searching for resources in your project. If the zone cannot be
        determined, you will then be prompted with all Google Cloud Platform
        zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --clear-labels
          Removes all labels. If --update-labels is also specified then
          --clear-labels is applied first.

          For example, to remove all labels:

              $ gcloud alpha compute instances update --clear-labels

          To set the labels to exactly "foo" and "baz":

              $ gcloud alpha compute instances update --clear-labels \
                --update-labels foo=bar,baz=qux

       --remove-labels=[KEY,...]
          A list of label keys to remove. If a label does not exist it is
          silently ignored.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. Usually,
    users of ALPHA commands and flags need to apply for access, agree to
    applicable terms, and have their projects whitelisted. Contact Google or
    sign up on a product's page for ALPHA access. Product pages can be found at
    https://cloud.google.com/products/. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute instances update
        $ gcloud beta compute instances update
