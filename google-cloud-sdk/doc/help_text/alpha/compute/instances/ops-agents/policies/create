DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute instances ops-agents policies create creates a
    policy that facilitates agent management across Google Cloud Compute
    instances based on user specified instance filters. This policy installs,
    specifies versioning, enables autoupgrade, and removes Ops Agents.

    The command returns the content of the created policy or an error
    indicating why the creation fails. The created policy takes effect
    asynchronously. It can take 10 ~ 15 minutes for the VMs to enforce the
    newly created policy.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     POLICY_ID
        ID of the policy.

        This ID must start with ops-agents-, contain only lowercase letters,
        numbers, and hyphens, end with a number or a letter, be between 1-63
        characters, and be unique within the project. The goal of the prefix
        ops-agents- is to easily distinguish these Ops Agents specific policies
        from other generic policies and lower the chance of naming conflicts.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --agent-rules=[type=TYPE,version=VERSION,package-state=PACKAGE-STATE,enable-autoupgrade=ENABLE-AUTOUPGRADE;...]
        A list of agent rules to be enforced by the policy.

        This flag must be quoted. Items in the list are separated by ";". Each
        item in the list is a <key, value> map that represents a logging or
        metrics agent. The allowed values of the key are as follows.

         type
            Type of agent to manage.

            Required. Allowed values: logging and metrics. Use logging for the
            Logging Agent (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/agent). Use
            metrics for the Monitoring Agent
            (https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/agent).

         version
            Version of the agent to install.

            Optional. Default to version=current-major. The allowed values and
            formats are as follows.

             version=latest
                With this setting, the latest version of the agent is installed
                at the time when the policy is applied to an instance.

                If multiple instances are created at different times but they
                all fall into the instance filter rules of an existing policy,
                they may end up with different versions of the agent, depending
                on what the latest version of the agent is at the policy
                application time (in this case the instance creation time). One
                way to avoid this is to set enable-autoupgrade=true. This
                guarantees that the installed agents on all instances that are
                managed by this policy are always up to date and conform to the
                same version.

                While this version=latest setting makes it easier to keep the
                agent version up to date, this setting does come with a
                potential risk. When a new major version is released, the
                policy may install the latest version of the agent from that
                new major release, which may introduce breaking changes. For
                production environments, consider using the
                version=MAJOR_VERSION.*.* setting below for safer agent
                deployments.

             version=MAJOR_VERSION.*.*
                With this setting, the latest version of agent from a specific
                major version is installed at the time when the policy is
                applied to an instance.

                If multiple instances are created at different times but they
                all fall into the instance filter rules of an existing policy,
                they may end up with different versions of the agent, depending
                on what the latest version of the agent is at the policy
                application time (in this case the instance creation time). One
                way to avoid this is to set enable-autoupgrade=true. This
                guarantees that the installed agents on all instances that are
                managed by this policy are always up to date within that major
                version and conform to the same version.

                When a new major release is out, this setting ensures that only
                the latest version from the specified major version is
                installed, which avoids accidentally introducing breaking
                changes. This is recommended for production environments to
                ensure safer agent deployments.

             version=current-major
                With this setting, the version field is automatically set to
                version=MAJOR_VERSION.*.*, where MAJOR_VERSION is the current
                latest major version released. Refer to the
                version=MAJOR_VERSION.*.* section for the expected behavior.

             version=MAJOR_VERSION.MINOR_VERSION.PATCH_VERSION
                With this setting, the specified exact version of agent is
                installed at the time when the policy is applied to an
                instance. enable-autoupgrade must be false for this setting.

                This setting is not recommended since it prevents the policy
                from installing new versions of the agent that include bug
                fixes and other improvements.

                One limitation of this setting is that if the agent gets
                manually uninstalled from the instances after the policy gets
                applied, the policy can only ensure that the agent is
                re-installed. It is not able to restore the expected exact
                version of the agent.

             version=5.5.2-BUILD_NUMBER
                Allowed for the metrics agent (type=metrics) only.

                With this setting, the specified exact build number of the
                deprecated 5.5.2 metrics agent is installed at the time when
                the policy is applied to an instance. enable-autoupgrade must
                be false for this setting.

                This setting is deprecated and will be decommissioned along
                with the 5.5.2 metrics agent on Apr 28, 2021
                (https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/deprecations/mon-agent).
                It is not recommended since it prevents the policy from
                installing new versions of the agent that include bug fixes and
                other improvements.

                One limitation of this setting is that if the agent gets
                manually uninstalled from the instances after the policy gets
                applied, the policy can only ensure that the agent is
                re-installed. It is not able to restore the expected exact
                version of the agent.

         package-state
            Desired package state of the agent.

            Optional. Default to package-state=installed. The allowed values
            are as follows.

             package-state=installed
                With this setting, the policy will ensure the agent package is
                installed on the instances and the agent service is running.

             package-state=removed
                With this setting, the policy will ensure the agent package is
                removed from the instances, which stops the service from
                running.

         enable-autoupgrade
            Whether to enable autoupgrade of the agent.

            Optional. Default to enable-autoupgrade=true. Allowed values: true
            or false. This has to be false if the agent version is set to a
            specific patch version in the format of
            version=MAJOR_VERSION.MINOR_VERSION.PATCH_VERSION.

     --os-types=[short-name=SHORT-NAME,version=VERSION;...]
        A list of OS types to filter instances that the policy applies to.

        For Alpha, exactly one OS type needs to be specified. The support for
        multiple OS types will be added later for more flexibility. Each OS
        type contains the following fields.

         short-name
            Short name of the OS.

            Required. Allowed values: centos, debian, rhel, sles, sles_sap,
            ubuntu. This is typically the ID value in the /etc/os-release file
            in the OS.

            To inspect the exact OS short name of an instance, run:

                $ gcloud beta compute instances os-inventory describe INSTANCE_NAME

         version
            Version of the OS.

            Required. This is typically the VERSION_ID value in the
            /etc/os-release file in the OS.

            To inspect the exact OS version of an instance, run:

                $ gcloud beta compute instances os-inventory describe INSTANCE_NAME

            Sample values:

                OS Short Name      OS Version
                centos             8
                centos             7
                debian             10
                debian             9
                rhel               8.*
                rhel               7.*
                sles               12.*
                sles               15.*
                sles_sap           12.*
                sles_sap           15.*
                ubuntu             16.04
                ubuntu             18.04
                ubuntu             19.10
                ubuntu             20.04

            * can be used to match a prefix of the version: <VERSION_PREFIX>*
            matches any version that starts with <VERSION_PREFIX>.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Description of the policy.

     --group-labels=[LABEL_NAME=LABEL_VALUE,LABEL_NAME=LABEL_VALUE,...;...]
        A list of label maps to filter instances that the policy applies to.

        Optional. The --group-labels flag needs to be quoted. Each label map
        item in the list are separated by ;. To manage instance labels, refer
        to the link:gcloud/beta/compute/instances/add-labels[gcloud beta
        compute instances add-labels] and the
        link:gcloud/beta/compute/instances/remove-labels[gcloud beta compute
        instances remove-labels] commands.

        Each label map item in the --group-labels list is a map in the format
        of LABEL_NAME=LABEL_VALUE,LABEL_NAME=LABEL_VALUE,.... An instance has
        to match all of the LABEL_NAME=LABEL_VALUE criteria inside a label map
        to be considered a match for that label map. But the instance only
        needs to match one label map in the --group-labels list.

        For example,
        --group-labels="env=prod,product=myapp;env=staging,product=myapp"
        implies the matching criteria is:

        (env=prod AND product=myapp) OR (env=staging AND product=myapp)

     --instances=[zones/ZONE_NAME/instances/INSTANCE_NAME,...]
        A list of fully-qualified names to filter instances that the policy
        applies to.

        Each item in the list must be in the format of
        zones/ZONE_NAME/instances/INSTANCE_NAME. The policy can also target
        instances that are not yet created.

        To list all existing instances, run:

            $ gcloud compute instances list

        The --instances flag is recommended for use during development and
        testing. In production environments, it's more common to select
        instances via a combination of --zones and --group-labels.

     --zones=[ZONE_NAME,...]
        A list of zones to filter instances to apply the policy.

        To list available zones, run:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        The use of the --zones and --group-labels flags is recommended for
        production environments. For testing and development, it's more common
        to select instances directly via the --instances flag.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To create a policy named ops-agents-test-policy that targets a single
    CentOS 7 VM instance named zones/us-central1-a/instances/test-instance for
    testing or development, and installs both Logging and Monitoring Agents on
    that VM instance, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instances ops-agents policies create \
            ops-agents-test-policy \
            --agent-rules="type=logging;type=metrics" \
            --description="A test policy." \
            --os-types=short-name=centos,version=7 \
            --instances=zones/us-central1-a/instances/test-instance

    To create a policy named ops-agents-prod-policy that targets all CentOS 7
    VMs in zone us-central1-a with either env=prod,product=myapp or
    env=staging,product=myapp labels, and makes sure the logging agent and
    metrics agent versions are pinned to specific major versions for staging
    and production, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instances ops-agents policies create \
            ops-agents-prod-policy \
            --agent-rules="type=logging,version=1.*.*;type=metrics,version=6\
        .*.*" --description="A prod policy." \
            --os-types=short-name=centos,version=7 --zones=us-central1-a \
            --group-labels="env=prod,product=myapp;env=staging,product=myapp\
        "

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access whitelist.
