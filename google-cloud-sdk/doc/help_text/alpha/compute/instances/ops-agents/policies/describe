NAME
    gcloud alpha compute instances ops-agents policies describe - describe a
        Google Cloud's operations suite agents (Ops Agents) policy

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute instances ops-agents policies describe POLICY_ID
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute instances ops-agents policies describe
    describes a policy that facilitates agent management across Compute Engine
    instances based on user specified instance filters. This policy installs,
    specifies versioning, enables autoupgrade, and removes Ops Agents.

    The command returns the content of one policy. If no policies are found, it
    returns a NOT_FOUND error.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     POLICY_ID
        ID of the policy.

        This ID must start with ops-agents-, contain only lowercase letters,
        numbers, and hyphens, end with a number or a letter, be between 1-63
        characters, and be unique within the project. The goal of the prefix
        ops-agents- is to easily distinguish these Ops Agents specific policies
        from other generic policies and lower the chance of naming conflicts.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To describe an Ops Agents policy named ops-agents-test-policy in the
    current project, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instances ops-agents policies describe \
            ops-agents-test-policy

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
