NAME
    gcloud alpha compute instances simulate-maintenance-event - simulate
        maintenance of virtual machine instances

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute instances simulate-maintenance-event INSTANCE_NAMES
        [INSTANCE_NAMES ...] [--async] [--zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute instances simulate-maintenance-event simulates
    a maintenance event on Compute Engine virtual machines.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAMES [INSTANCE_NAMES ...]
        Names of the instances to operate on. For details on valid instance
        names, refer to the criteria documented under the field 'name' at:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the instances to operate on. If not specified, the user may be
        prompted to select a zone. gcloud will attempt to identify the zone by
        searching for resources in the user's project. If the zone cannot be
        determined, the user will then be prompted with all Google Cloud
        Platform zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, the user can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To simulate a maintenance event on an instance named test-instance located
    in zone us-east1-d, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instances simulate-maintenance-event \
            test-instance --zone=us-east1-d

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute instances simulate-maintenance-event
        $ gcloud beta compute instances simulate-maintenance-event
