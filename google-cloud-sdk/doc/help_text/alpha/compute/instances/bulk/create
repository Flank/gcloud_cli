DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute instances bulk create facilitates the creation
    of multiple Compute Engine virtual machines with a single command. They
    offer a number of advantages compared to the single instance creation
    command. This includes the ability to automatically pick a zone in which to
    create instances based on resource availability, the ability to specify
    that the request be atomic or best-effort, and a faster rate of instance
    creation.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --predefined-names=[INSTANCE_NAME,...]
        List of predefined names for the Compute Engine virtual machines being
        created. If --count is not specified, the number of virtual machines
        created will equal the number of names provided.

     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region in which to create the Compute Engine virtual machines.
          Compute Engine will select a zone in which to create all virtual
          machines.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone in which to create the Compute Engine virtual machines.

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

          Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --accelerator=[count=COUNT],[type=TYPE]
        Attaches accelerators (e.g. GPUs) to the instances.

         type
            The specific type (e.g. nvidia-tesla-k80 for nVidia Tesla K80) of
            accelerator to attach to the instances. Use 'gcloud compute
            accelerator-types list' to learn about all available accelerator
            types.

         count
            Number of accelerators to attach to each instance. The default
            value is 1.

     --no-address
        If provided, the instances are not assigned external IP addresses. To
        pull container images, you must configure private Google access if
        using Container Registry or configure Cloud NAT for instances to access
        container images directly. For more information, see:
        * https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-private-google-access
        * https://cloud.google.com/nat/docs/using-nat

     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --boot-disk-auto-delete
        Automatically delete boot disks when their instances are deleted.
        Enabled by default, use --no-boot-disk-auto-delete to disable.

     --boot-disk-device-name=BOOT_DISK_DEVICE_NAME
        The name the guest operating system will see for the boot disk. This
        option can only be specified if a new boot disk is being created (as
        opposed to mounting an existing persistent disk).

     --boot-disk-size=BOOT_DISK_SIZE
        The size of the boot disk. This option can only be specified if a new
        boot disk is being created (as opposed to mounting an existing
        persistent disk). The value must be a whole number followed by a size
        unit of KB for kilobyte, MB for megabyte, GB for gigabyte, or TB for
        terabyte. For example, 10GB will produce a 10 gigabyte disk. The
        minimum size a boot disk can have is 10 GB. Disk size must be a
        multiple of 1 GB. Limit boot disk size to 2 TB to account for MBR
        partition table limitations. Default size unit is GB.

     --boot-disk-type=BOOT_DISK_TYPE
        The type of the boot disk. This option can only be specified if a new
        boot disk is being created (as opposed to mounting an existing
        persistent disk). To get a list of available disk types, run $ gcloud
        compute disk-types list.

     --can-ip-forward
        If provided, allows the instances to send and receive packets with
        non-matching destination or source IP addresses.

     --confidential-compute
        The instance will boot with Confidential Computing enabled.
        Confidential Computing is based on Secure Encrypted Virtualization
        (SEV), an AMD virtualization feature for running confidential
        instances.

     --count=COUNT
        Number of Compute Engine virtual machines to create. If not specified,
        the number of virtual machines created will equal the number of names
        provided to --predefined-names.

     --create-disk=[PROPERTY=VALUE,...]
        Creates and attaches persistent disks to the instances.

         name
            Specifies the name of the disk. This option cannot be specified if
            more than one instance is being created.

         description
            Optional textual description for the disk being created.

         mode
            Specifies the mode of the disk. Supported options are ro for
            read-only and rw for read-write. If omitted, rw is used as a
            default.

         image
            Specifies the name of the image that the disk will be initialized
            with. A new disk will be created based on the given image. To view
            a list of public images and projects, run $ gcloud compute images
            list. It is best practice to use image when a specific version of
            an image is needed. If both image and image-family flags are
            omitted a blank disk will be created.

         image-family
            The image family for the operating system that the boot disk will
            be initialized with. Compute Engine offers multiple Linux
            distributions, some of which are available as both regular and
            Shielded VM images. When a family is specified instead of an image,
            the latest non-deprecated image associated with that family is
            used. It is best practice to use --image-family when the latest
            version of an image is needed.

         image-project
            The Google Cloud project against which all image and image family
            references will be resolved. It is best practice to define
            image-project. A full list of available projects can be generated
            by running gcloud projects list.

            + If specifying one of our public images, image-project must be
              provided.
            + If there are several of the same image-family value in multiple
              projects, image-project must be specified to clarify the image to
              be used.
            + If not specified and either image or image-family is provided,
              the current default project is used.

         size
            The size of the disk. The value must be a whole number followed by
            a size unit of KB for kilobyte, MB for megabyte, GB for gigabyte,
            or TB for terabyte. For example, 10GB will produce a 10 gigabyte
            disk. Disk size must be a multiple of 1 GB. If not specified, the
            default image size will be used for the new disk.

         type
            The type of the disk. To get a list of available disk types, run $
            gcloud compute disk-types list. The default disk type is
            pd-standard.

         device-name
            An optional name that indicates the disk name the guest operating
            system will see. If omitted, a device name of the form
            persistent-disk-N will be used.

         auto-delete
            If yes, this persistent disk will be automatically deleted when the
            instance is deleted. However, if the disk is later detached from
            the instance, this option won't apply. The default value for this
            is yes.

         source-snapshot
            The source disk snapshot that will be used to create the disk. You
            can provide this as a full URL to the snapshot or just the snapshot
            name. For example, the following are valid values:

                o https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/myproject/global/snapshots/snapshot
                o snapshot

         disk-resource-policy
            Resource policy that will be applied to created disk. You can
            provide full or partial URL. For more details see

                    + https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/beta/compute/resource-policies/
                    + https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/scheduled-snapshots

         image-csek-required
            Specifies the name of the CSK protected image that the disk will be
            initialized with. A new disk will be created based on the given
            image. To view a list of public images and projects, run $ gcloud
            compute images list. It is best practice to use image when a
            specific version of an image is needed. If both image and
            image-family flags are omitted a blank disk will be created. Must
            be specified with image-csek-key-file.

         image-csek-key-file
            Path to a Customer-Supplied Encryption Key (CSEK) key file for the
            image. Must be specified with image-csek-required.

     --deletion-protection
        Enables deletion protection for the instance.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Specifies a textual description of the instances.

     --enable-display-device
        Enable a display device on VM instances. Disabled by default.

     --[no-]enable-nested-virtualization
        If set to true, enables nested virtualization for the instance. Use
        --enable-nested-virtualization to enable and
        --no-enable-nested-virtualization to disable.

     --erase-windows-vss-signature
        Specifies whether the disk restored from source snapshots or source
        machine image should erase Windows specific VSS signature. See
        https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/compute/disks/snapshot#--guest-flush

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     --local-ssd=[device-name=DEVICE-NAME],[interface=INTERFACE],[size=SIZE]
        Attaches a local SSD to the instances.

        This flag is currently in BETA and may change without notice.

         device-name
            Optional. A name that indicates the disk name the guest operating
            system will see. Can only be specified if interface is SCSI. If
            omitted, a device name of the form local-ssd-N will be used.

         interface
            Optional. The kind of disk interface exposed to the VM for this
            SSD. Valid values are SCSI and NVME. SCSI is the default and is
            supported by more guest operating systems. NVME may provide higher
            performance.

         size
            Optional. Size of the SSD disk. The value must be a whole number
            followed by a size unit of KB for kilobyte, MB for megabyte, GB for
            gigabyte, or TB for terabyte. For example, 750GB will produce a 750
            gigabyte disk. The size must be a multiple of 375 GB and the
            default is 375 GB. For Alpha API only.

     --machine-type=MACHINE_TYPE
        Specifies the machine type used for the instances. To get a list of
        available machine types, run 'gcloud compute machine-types list'. If
        unspecified, the default type is n1-standard-1.

     --metadata=KEY=VALUE,[KEY=VALUE,...]
        Metadata to be made available to the guest operating system running on
        the instances. Each metadata entry is a key/value pair separated by an
        equals sign. Each metadata key must be unique and have a max of 128
        bytes in length. Each value must have a max of 256 KB in length.
        Multiple arguments can be passed to this flag, e.g., --metadata
        key-1=value-1,key-2=value-2,key-3=value-3. The combined total size for
        all metadata entries is 512 KB.

        In images that have Compute Engine tools installed on them, such as the
        official images (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images), the
        following metadata keys have special meanings:

         startup-script
            Specifies a script that will be executed by the instances once they
            start running. For convenience, --metadata-from-file can be used to
            pull the value from a file.

         startup-script-url
            Same as startup-script except that the script contents are pulled
            from a publicly-accessible location on the web.

     --metadata-from-file=KEY=LOCAL_FILE_PATH,[...]
        Same as --metadata except that the value for the entry will be read
        from a local file. This is useful for values that are too large such as
        startup-script contents.

     --min-count=MIN_COUNT
        The minimum number of Compute Engine virtual machines that must be
        successfully created for the operation to be considered a success. If
        the operation successfully creates as many virtual machines as
        specified here they will be persisted, otherwise the operation rolls
        back and deletes all created virtual machines. If not specified, this
        value is equal to --count.

     --min-cpu-platform=PLATFORM
        When specified, the VM will be scheduled on host with specified CPU
        architecture or a newer one. To list available CPU platforms in given
        zone, run:

            $ gcloud alpha compute zones describe ZONE \
              --format="value(availableCpuPlatforms)"

        Default setting is "AUTOMATIC".

        CPU platform selection is available only in selected zones.

        You can find more information on-line:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/specify-min-cpu-platform

     --min-node-cpu=MIN_NODE_CPU
        Minimum number of virtual CPUs this instance will consume when running
        on a sole-tenant node.

     --network=NETWORK
        Specifies the network that the instances will be part of. If --subnet
        is also specified subnet must be a subnetwork of network specified by
        --network. If neither is specified, this defaults to the "default"
        network.

     --network-interface=[PROPERTY=VALUE,...]
        Adds a network interface to the instance. Mutually exclusive with any
        of these flags: --network, --network-tier, --subnet. This flag can be
        repeated to specify multiple network interfaces.

         network
            Specifies the network that the interface will be part of. If subnet
            is also specified it must be subnetwork of this network. If neither
            is specified, this defaults to the "default" network.

         network-tier
            Specifies the network tier of the interface. NETWORK_TIER must be
            one of: PREMIUM, STANDARD. The default value is PREMIUM.

         subnet
            Specifies the subnet that the interface will be part of. If network
            key is also specified this must be a subnetwork of the specified
            network.

     --network-tier=NETWORK_TIER
        Specifies the network tier that will be used to configure the instance.
        NETWORK_TIER must be one of: PREMIUM, STANDARD. The default value is
        PREMIUM.

     --post-key-revocation-action-type=POLICY
        The instance will be shut down when the KMS key of one of its disk is
        revoked, if set to SHUTDOWN.

        Default setting is NOOP.

        POLICY must be one of: noop, shutdown.

     --preemptible
        If provided, instances will be preemptible and time-limited. Instances
        may be preempted to free up resources for standard VM instances, and
        will only be able to run for a limited amount of time. Preemptible
        instances can not be restarted and will not migrate.

     --resource-policies=[RESOURCE_POLICY,...]
        A list of resource policy names to be added to the instance. The
        policies must exist in the same region as the instance.

     --restart-on-failure
        The instances will be restarted if they are terminated by Compute
        Engine. This does not affect terminations performed by the user.
        Enabled by default, use --no-restart-on-failure to disable.

     --shielded-integrity-monitoring
        Enables monitoring and attestation of the boot integrity of the
        instance. The attestation is performed against the integrity policy
        baseline. This baseline is initially derived from the implicitly
        trusted boot image when the instance is created. This baseline can be
        updated by using --shielded-vm-learn-integrity-policy. On Shielded VMs,
        integrity monitoring is enabled by default. For information about how
        to modify Shielded VM options, see
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/modifying-shielded-vm.

     --shielded-secure-boot
        The instance boots with secure boot enabled. On Shielded VMs, Secure
        Boot is not enabled by default. For information about how to modify
        Shielded VM options, see
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/modifying-shielded-vm.

     --shielded-vtpm
        The instance boots with the TPM (Trusted Platform Module) enabled. A
        TPM is a hardware module that can be used for different security
        operations such as remote attestation, encryption, and sealing of keys.
        On Shielded VMs, vTPM is enabled by default. For information about how
        to modify Shielded VM options, see
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/modifying-shielded-vm.

     --source-instance-template=SOURCE_INSTANCE_TEMPLATE
        The name of the instance template that the instance will be created
        from.

        Users can also override machine type and labels. Values of other flags
        will be ignored and --source-instance-template will be used instead.

     --subnet=SUBNET
        Specifies the subnet that the instances will be part of. If --network
        is also specified subnet must be a subnetwork of network specified by
        --network.

     --tags=TAG,[TAG,...]
        Specifies a list of tags to apply to the instance. These tags allow
        network firewall rules and routes to be applied to specified VM
        instances. See gcloud compute firewall-rules create(1) for more
        details.

        To read more about configuring network tags, read this guide:
        https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/add-remove-network-tags

        To list instances with their respective status and tags, run:

            $ gcloud compute instances list \
                --format='table(name,status,tags.list())'

        To list instances tagged with a specific tag, tag1, run:

            $ gcloud compute instances list --filter='tags:tag1'

     Custom machine type extensions.

       --custom-cpu=CUSTOM_CPU
          A whole number value indicating how many cores are desired in the
          custom machine type. This flag must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --custom-memory=CUSTOM_MEMORY
          A whole number value indicating how much memory is desired in the
          custom machine type. A size unit should be provided (eg. 3072MB or
          9GB) - if no units are specified, GB is assumed. This flag must be
          specified if any of the other arguments in this group are specified.

       --custom-extensions
          Use the extended custom machine type.

       --custom-vm-type=CUSTOM_VM_TYPE
          Specifies VM type. n1 - VMs with CPU platforms Skylake and older, n2
          - VMs with CPU platform Cascade Lake. n2 offers flexible sizing from
          2 to 80 vCPUs, and 1 to 640GBs of memory. It also features a number
          of performance enhancements including exposing a more accurate NUMA
          topology to the guest OS. The default is n1.

     --image-project=IMAGE_PROJECT
        The Google Cloud project against which all image and image family
        references will be resolved. It is best practice to define
        image-project. A full list of available projects can be generated by
        running gcloud projects list.
        * If specifying one of our public images, image-project must be
          provided.
        * If there are several of the same image-family value in multiple
          projects, image-project must be specified to clarify the image to be
          used.
        * If not specified and either image or image-family is provided, the
          current default project is used.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --image=IMAGE
          Specifies the boot image for the instances. For each instance, a new
          boot disk will be created from the given image. Each boot disk will
          have the same name as the instance. To view a list of public images
          and projects, run $ gcloud compute images list. It is best practice
          to use --image when a specific version of an image is needed.

          When using this option, --boot-disk-device-name and --boot-disk-size
          can be used to override the boot disk's device name and size,
          respectively.

       --image-family=IMAGE_FAMILY
          The image family for the operating system that the boot disk will be
          initialized with. Compute Engine offers multiple Linux distributions,
          some of which are available as both regular and Shielded VM images.
          When a family is specified instead of an image, the latest
          non-deprecated image associated with that family is used. It is best
          practice to use --image-family when the latest version of an image is
          needed.

          By default, debian-10 is assumed for this flag.

       --source-snapshot=SOURCE_SNAPSHOT
          The name of the source disk snapshot that the instance boot disk will
          be created from. You can provide this as a full URL to the snapshot
          or just the snapshot name. For example, the following are valid
          values:

          + https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/myproject/global/snapshots/snapshot
          + snapshot

     Maintenance Behavior. At most one of these may be specified:

       --maintenance-policy=MAINTENANCE_POLICY
          (DEPRECATED) Specifies the behavior of the instances when their host
          machines undergo maintenance. The default is MIGRATE.

          The --maintenance-policy flag is now deprecated. Please use
          --on-host-maintenance instead. MAINTENANCE_POLICY must be one of:

           MIGRATE
              The instances should be migrated to a new host. This will
              temporarily impact the performance of instances during a
              migration event.
           TERMINATE
              The instances should be terminated.

       --on-host-maintenance=MAINTENANCE_POLICY
          Specifies the behavior of the instances when their host machines
          undergo maintenance. The default is MIGRATE. MAINTENANCE_POLICY must
          be one of:

           MIGRATE
              The instances should be migrated to a new host. This will
              temporarily impact the performance of instances during a
              migration event.
           TERMINATE
              The instances should be terminated.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --public-dns
          Assigns a public DNS name to the instance.

       --no-public-dns
          If provided, the instance will not be assigned a public DNS name.

     Specifies the reservation for the instance.

       --reservation=RESERVATION
          The name of the reservation, required when
          --reservation-affinity=specific.

       --reservation-affinity=RESERVATION_AFFINITY; default="any"
          The type of reservation for the instance. RESERVATION_AFFINITY must
          be one of: any, none, specific.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --scopes=[SCOPE,...]
          If not provided, the instance will be assigned the default scopes,
          described below. However, if neither --scopes nor --no-scopes are
          specified and the project has no default service account, then the
          instance will be created with no scopes. Note that the level of
          access that a service account has is determined by a combination of
          access scopes and IAM roles so you must configure both access scopes
          and IAM roles for the service account to work properly.

          SCOPE can be either the full URI of the scope or an alias. default
          scopes are assigned to all instances. Available aliases are:

       --no-scopes
          Create instance without scopes

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --service-account=SERVICE_ACCOUNT
          A service account is an identity attached to the instance. Its access
          tokens can be accessed through the instance metadata server and are
          used to authenticate applications on the instance. The account can be
          set using an email address corresponding to the required service
          account.

          If not provided, the instance will use the project's default service
          account.

       --no-service-account
          Create instance without service account

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To create instances called 'example-instance-1', 'example-instance-2', and
    'example-instance-3' in the 'us-central1-a' zone, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instances bulk create \
            --predefined-names=example-instance-1,example-instance-2,\
        example-instance-3 --zone=us-central1-a

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
