NAME
    gcloud alpha compute instances delete-access-config - delete an access
        configuration from a virtual machine network interface

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute instances delete-access-config INSTANCE_NAME
        [--access-config-name=ACCESS_CONFIG_NAME; default="external-nat"]
        [--network-interface=NETWORK_INTERFACE; default="nic0"] [--zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute instances delete-access-config is used to
    delete access configurations from network interfaces of Google Compute
    Engine virtual machines. Access configurations allow you to assign a
    public, external IP to a virtual machine.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAME
        Name of the instance to operate on. For details on valid instance
        names, refer to the criteria documented under the field 'name' at:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances

FLAGS
     --access-config-name=ACCESS_CONFIG_NAME; default="external-nat"
        Specifies the name of the access configuration to delete. external-nat
        is used as the default if this flag is not provided.

     --network-interface=NETWORK_INTERFACE; default="nic0"
        Specifies the name of the network interface from which to delete the
        access configuration. If this is not provided, then nic0 is used as the
        default.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the instance to operate on. If not specified, the user may be
        prompted to select a zone. gcloud will attempt to identify the zone by
        searching for resources in the user's project. If the zone cannot be
        determined, the user will then be prompted with all Google Cloud
        Platform zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, the user can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To remove the externally accessible IP from a virtual machine named
    example-instance in zone us-central1-a, run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instances delete-access-config \
            example-instance --zone=us-central1-a

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute instances delete-access-config
        $ gcloud beta compute instances delete-access-config
