NAME
    gcloud alpha compute instances set-iam-policy - set IAM policy for an
        instance

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute instances set-iam-policy INSTANCE_NAME POLICY_FILE
        [--zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute instances set-iam-policy sets the IAM Policy
    associated with a Google Compute Engine instance in a project.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAME
        Name of the instance to set the IAM policy of.

     POLICY_FILE
        JSON or YAML file containing the IAM policy.

FLAGS
     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the instance to set the IAM policy of. If not specified, you
        may be prompted to select a zone. gcloud will attempt to identify the
        zone by searching for resources in your project. If the zone cannot be
        determined, you will then be prompted with all Google Cloud Platform
        zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    The following command will read an IAM policy defined in a JSON file
    'policy.json' and set it for an instance with identifier 'my-instance'

        $ gcloud alpha compute instances set-iam-policy my-instance \
            policy.json

    See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details of the
    policy file format and contents.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
    https://cloud.google.com/support/. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta compute instances set-iam-policy
