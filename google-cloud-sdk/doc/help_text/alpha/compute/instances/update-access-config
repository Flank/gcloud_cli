NAME
    gcloud alpha compute instances update-access-config - update a Compute
        Engine virtual machine access configuration

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute instances update-access-config INSTANCE_NAME
        [--network-interface=NETWORK_INTERFACE; default="nic0"]
        [--network-tier=NETWORK_TIER] [--zone=ZONE]
        [--public-dns | --no-public-dns] [--public-ptr | --no-public-ptr]
        [--public-ptr-domain=PUBLIC_PTR_DOMAIN | --no-public-ptr-domain]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute instances update-access-config is used to
    update access configurations for network interfaces of Compute Engine
    virtual machines.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAME
        Name of the instance to operate on. For details on valid instance
        names, refer to the criteria documented under the field 'name' at:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances

FLAGS
     --network-interface=NETWORK_INTERFACE; default="nic0"
        Specifies the name of the network interface which contains the access
        configuration. If this is not provided, then "nic0" is used as the
        default.

     --network-tier=NETWORK_TIER
        Update the network tier of the access configuration. It does not allow
        to change from PREMIUM to STANDARD and visa versa.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the instance to operate on. If not specified, the user may be
        prompted to select a zone. gcloud will attempt to identify the zone by
        searching for resources in the user's project. If the zone cannot be
        determined, the user will then be prompted with all Google Cloud
        Platform zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, the user can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --public-dns
          Assigns a public DNS name to the external IP in the access
          configuration. This option can only be specified for the default
          network-interface, "nic0".

       --no-public-dns
          If provided, the external IP in the access configuration will not be
          assigned a public DNS name.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --public-ptr
          Creates a DNS PTR record for the external IP in the access
          configuration. This option can only be specified for the default
          network-interface, "nic0".

       --no-public-ptr
          If provided, no DNS PTR record is created for the external IP in the
          access configuration. Mutually exclusive with public-ptr-domain.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --public-ptr-domain=PUBLIC_PTR_DOMAIN
          Assigns a custom PTR domain for the external IP in the access
          configuration. Mutually exclusive with no-public-ptr. This option can
          only be specified for the default network-interface, "nic0".

       --no-public-ptr-domain
          If both this flag and --public-ptr are specified, creates a DNS PTR
          record for the external IP in the access configuration with the PTR
          domain name being the DNS name of the instance.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To update network interface of an instance to 'nic0', run:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instances update-access-config \
            example-instance  --network-interface=nic0 --zone=us-central1-b

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute instances update-access-config
        $ gcloud beta compute instances update-access-config
