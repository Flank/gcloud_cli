NAME
    gcloud alpha compute instances remove-resource-policies - remove resource
        policies to Google Compute Engine VM instances

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute instances remove-resource-policies INSTANCE_NAME
        --resource-policies=[RESOURCE_POLICY,...] [--zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute instances remove-resource-policies removes
    resource policies from Google Compute Engine virtual instances.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAME
        Name of the instance to remove resource policies from.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --resource-policies=[RESOURCE_POLICY,...]
        A list of resource policy names to be removed from the instance. The
        policies must exist in the same region as the instance.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the instance to remove resource policies from. If not
        specified, you may be prompted to select a zone. gcloud will attempt to
        identify the zone by searching for resources in your project. If the
        zone cannot be determined, you will then be prompted with all Google
        Cloud Platform zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
