NAME
    gcloud alpha compute instances set-scheduling - set scheduling options for
        Google Compute Engine virtual machines

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute instances set-scheduling INSTANCE_NAME
        [--min-node-cpus=MIN_NODE_CPUS] [--[no-]restart-on-failure]
        [--zone=ZONE]
        [--maintenance-policy=MAINTENANCE_POLICY
          | --on-host-maintenance=MAINTENANCE_POLICY] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) $gcloud alpha compute instances set-scheduling is used to configure
    scheduling options for Google Compute Engine virtual machines.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAME
        Name of the instance to operate on. For details on valid instance
        names, refer to the criteria documented under the field 'name' at:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances

FLAGS
     --min-node-cpus=MIN_NODE_CPUS
        Minimum number of virtual CPUs this instance will consume when running
        on a sole-tenant node.

     --[no-]restart-on-failure
        The instances will be restarted if they are terminated by Compute
        Engine. This does not affect terminations performed by the user. Use
        --restart-on-failure to enable and --no-restart-on-failure to disable.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the instance to operate on. If not specified, the user may be
        prompted to select a zone. gcloud will attempt to identify the zone by
        searching for resources in the user's project. If the zone cannot be
        determined, the user will then be prompted with all Google Cloud
        Platform zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, the user can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

     Maintenance Behavior. At most one of these may be specified:

       --maintenance-policy=MAINTENANCE_POLICY
          (DEPRECATED) Specifies the behavior of the instances when their host
          machines undergo maintenance. The default is MIGRATE.

          The --maintenance-policy flag is now deprecated. Please use
          --on-host-maintenance instead. MAINTENANCE_POLICY must be one of:

           MIGRATE
              The instances should be migrated to a new host. This will
              temporarily impact the performance of instances during a
              migration event.
           TERMINATE
              The instances should be terminated.

       --on-host-maintenance=MAINTENANCE_POLICY
          Specifies the behavior of the instances when their host machines
          undergo maintenance. The default is MIGRATE. MAINTENANCE_POLICY must
          be one of:

           MIGRATE
              The instances should be migrated to a new host. This will
              temporarily impact the performance of instances during a
              migration event.
           TERMINATE
              The instances should be terminated.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access whitelist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute instances set-scheduling
        $ gcloud beta compute instances set-scheduling
