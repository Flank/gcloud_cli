NAME
    gcloud alpha compute rolling-updates rollback - rolls back an existing
        update

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute rolling-updates rollback UPDATE [--zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) (DEPRECATED) This command group is deprecated. Use gcloud alpha
    compute instance-groups managed rolling-action command group instead.

    Rolls back the update in state ROLLING_FORWARD, ROLLING_BACK or PAUSED
    (fails if the update is in any other state). No-op if invoked in state
    ROLLED_BACK.

    Rollback sets the template that the Managed Instance Group used before the
    update was started and gradually restarts back to the old template all
    instances that are running in the new template.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     UPDATE
        Update id.

FLAGS
     --zone=ZONE
        Rolling update zone name. Overrides the default compute/zone property
        value for this command invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. Usually,
    users of ALPHA commands and flags need to apply for access, agree to
    applicable terms, and have their projects whitelisted. Contact Google or
    sign up on a product's page for ALPHA access. Product pages can be found at
