NAME
    gcloud alpha compute rolling-updates resume - resume an existing update

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute rolling-updates resume UPDATE [--zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) (DEPRECATED) Resume an existing update.

    This command group is deprecated. Use gcloud alpha compute instance-groups
    managed rolling-action command group instead.

    Resumes the update in state ROLLING_FORWARD or PAUSED (fails if the update
    is in any other state). No-op if invoked in state ROLLED_OUT.

    Resume continues applying the new template and should be used when rollback
    was started, but the user decided to proceed with the update.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     UPDATE
        Update id.

FLAGS
     --zone=ZONE
        Rolling update zone name. Overrides the default compute/zone property
        value for this command invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
