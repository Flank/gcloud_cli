DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) (DEPRECATED) This command group is deprecated. Use gcloud alpha
    compute instance-groups managed rolling-action command group instead.

    A rolling update causes the service to gradually update your existing
    instances.

    You can increase the number of instances updated simultaneously with the
    --max-num-concurrent-instances flag.

    If you are not sure you want to apply an update to all existing instances,
    you can use the --auto-pause-after-instances flag and the update will
    automatically be paused after updating the number of instances specified.
    Afterwards, you can decide whether to cancel or continue the update.

    In case you notice your managed instance group misbehaving due to the new
    template, you can roll back the update. This will stop the update from
    being applied to more instances, and instances already created with the new
    template will be recreated with the last template applied before the
    current update.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --group=GROUP
        Instance group name.

     --template=TEMPLATE
        Name of the Compute Engine instance template resource.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --action=ACTION; default="RECREATE"
        Action to be performed on each instance. Currently only 'RECREATE' is
        supported. ACTION must be (currently only one value is supported):
        RECREATE.

     --auto-pause-after-instances=AUTO_PAUSE_AFTER_INSTANCES
        Number of instances after which the update will be automatically
        paused.

     --instance-startup-timeout=INSTANCE_STARTUP_TIMEOUT
        Maximum amount of time we will wait after finishing all steps until
        instance is in RUNNING state. If this deadline is exceeded instance
        update is considered as failed. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for
        information on duration formats.

     --max-num-concurrent-instances=MAX_NUM_CONCURRENT_INSTANCES
        Maximum number of instances that can be updated simultaneously.

     --max-num-failed-instances=MAX_NUM_FAILED_INSTANCES
        Maximum number of instance updates that can fail without failing the
        group update. Instance update is considered failed if any of its update
        actions (currently only 'RECREATE' call) failed with permanent failure,
        or if after finishing all update actions this instance is not running.

     --min-instance-update-time=MIN_INSTANCE_UPDATE_TIME
        Specifies minimum amount of time we will spend on updating single
        instance, measuring at the start of the first update action (currently
        only 'RECREATE' call). If actual instance update takes less time we
        will simply sleep before proceeding with next instance. See $ gcloud
        topic datetimes for information on duration formats.

     --zone=ZONE
        Rolling update zone name. Overrides the default compute/zone property
        value for this command invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
