DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute health-checks create http2 is used to create a
    HTTP2 health check. HTTP2 health checks monitor instances in a load
    balancer controlled by a target pool. All arguments to the command are
    optional except for the name of the health check. For more information on
    load balancing, see
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing-and-autoscaling/

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        The name of the HTTP2 health check to create.

FLAGS
     --check-interval=CHECK_INTERVAL; default="5s"
        How often to perform a health check for an instance. For example,
        specifying 10s will run the check every 10 seconds. The default value
        is 5s. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on duration
        formats.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional string description for the HTTP2 health check.

     --healthy-threshold=HEALTHY_THRESHOLD; default=2
        The number of consecutive successful health checks before an unhealthy
        instance is marked as healthy. The default is 2.

     --host=HOST
        The value of the host header used in this HTTP health check request. By
        default, this is empty and Google Compute Engine automatically sets the
        host header in health requests to the same external IP address as the
        forwarding rule associated with the target pool.

     --port=PORT; default=80
        The TCP port number that this health check monitors. The default value
        is 80.

     --port-name=PORT_NAME
        The port name that this health check monitors. By default, this is
        empty.

     --port-specification=PORT_SPECIFICATION
        Specifies how port is selected for health checking. If not specified,
        HTTP2 health check follows behavior specified in --port and -port-name
        fields. PORT_SPECIFICATION must be one of:

         use-fixed-port
            --port is used for health checking.
         use-named-port
            --port-name is used for health checking.
         use-serving-port
            For NetworkEndpointGroup, the port specified for each network
            endpoint is used for health checking. For other backends, the port
            or named port specified in the Backend Service is used for health
            checking.

     --proxy-header=PROXY_HEADER; default="NONE"
        The type of proxy protocol header to be sent to the backend.
        PROXY_HEADER must be one of:

         NONE
            No proxy header is added.
         PROXY_V1
            Adds the header "PROXY UNKNOWN\r\n".

     --request-path=REQUEST_PATH; default="/"
        The request path that this health check monitors. For example,
        /healthcheck. The default value is ``/''.

     --response=RESPONSE
        When empty, status code of the response determines health. When not
        empty, presence of specified string in first 1024 characters of
        response body determines health. Only ASCII characters allowed.

     --timeout=TIMEOUT; default="5s"
        If Google Compute Engine doesn't receive a healthy response from the
        instance by the time specified by the value of this flag, the health
        check request is considered a failure. For example, specifying 10s will
        cause the check to wait for 10 seconds before considering the request a
        failure. The default value is 5s. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for
        information on duration formats.

     --unhealthy-threshold=UNHEALTHY_THRESHOLD; default=2
        The number of consecutive health check failures before a healthy
        instance is marked as unhealthy. The default is 2.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES

    users of ALPHA commands and flags need to apply for access, agree to
    applicable terms, and have their projects whitelisted. Contact Google or
