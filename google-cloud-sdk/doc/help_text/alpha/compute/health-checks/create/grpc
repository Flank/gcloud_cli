DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute health-checks create grpc is used to create a
    gRPC non-legacy health check. gRPC health checks monitor instances in a
    load balancer controlled by a target pool. All arguments to the command are
    optional except for the name of the health check and port related
    arguments. For more information on load balancing, see
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing-and-autoscaling/

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the gRPC health check to create.

FLAGS
     --check-interval=CHECK_INTERVAL; default="5s"
        How often to perform a health check for an instance. For example,
        specifying 10s will run the check every 10 seconds. The default value
        is 5s. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on duration
        formats.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional string description for the gRPC health check.

     --enable-logging
        Enable logging of health check probe results to Stackdriver. Logging is
        disabled by default.

            Use --no-enable-logging to disable logging.

     --grpc-service-name=GRPC_SERVICE_NAME
        An optional gRPC service name string of up to 1024 characters to
        include in the gRPC health check request. Only ASCII characters are
        allowed.

     --healthy-threshold=HEALTHY_THRESHOLD; default=2
        The number of consecutive successful health checks before an unhealthy
        instance is marked as healthy. The default is 2.

     --timeout=TIMEOUT; default="5s"
        If Google Compute Engine doesn't receive a healthy response from the
        instance by the time specified by the value of this flag, the health
        check request is considered a failure. For example, specifying 10s will
        cause the check to wait for 10 seconds before considering the request a
        failure. The default value is 5s. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for
        information on duration formats.

     --unhealthy-threshold=UNHEALTHY_THRESHOLD; default=2
        The number of consecutive health check failures before a healthy
        instance is marked as unhealthy. The default is 2.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --global
          If set, the gRPC health check is global.

       --region=REGION
          Region of the gRPC health check to create. If not specified, you may
          be prompted to select a region.

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/region property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/region

          Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     These flags configure the port that the health check monitors. If both
     --port and --port-name are specified, --port takes precedence.

       --port=PORT
          The TCP port number that this health check monitors.

       --port-name=PORT_NAME
          The port name that this health check monitors. By default, this is
          empty.

       --use-serving-port
          If given, use the "serving port" for health checks:

          + When health checking network endpoints in a Network Endpoint
            Group, use the port specified with each endpoint.
          + When health checking other backends, use the port or named port
            of the backend service.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access whitelist.
