    gcloud alpha compute health-checks create udp - create a UDP health check
        to monitor load balanced instances

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute health-checks create udp NAME --request=REQUEST
        --response=RESPONSE [--check-interval=CHECK_INTERVAL; default="5s"]
        [--description=DESCRIPTION]
        [--healthy-threshold=HEALTHY_THRESHOLD; default=2] [--port=PORT]
        [--port-name=PORT_NAME] [--timeout=TIMEOUT; default="5s"]
        [--unhealthy-threshold=UNHEALTHY_THRESHOLD; default=2]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute health-checks create udp is used to create a
    UDP health check. UDP health checks monitor instances in a load balancer
    controlled by a target pool. All arguments to the command are optional
    except for the name of the health check, request and response. For more
    information on load balancing, see
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing-and-autoscaling/

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the UDP health check to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --request=REQUEST
        Application data to send in payload of an UDP packet. It is an error if
        this is empty.

     --response=RESPONSE
        The bytes to match against the beginning of the response data. It is an
        error if this is empty.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --check-interval=CHECK_INTERVAL; default="5s"
        How often to perform a health check for an instance. For example,
        specifying 10s will run the check every 10 seconds. The default value
        is 5s. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on duration
        formats.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional string description for the UDP health check.

     --healthy-threshold=HEALTHY_THRESHOLD; default=2
        The number of consecutive successful health checks before an unhealthy
        instance is marked as healthy. The default is 2.

     --port=PORT
        The UDP port number that this health check monitors. The default is not
        set.

     --port-name=PORT_NAME
        The port name that this health check monitors. By default, this is
        empty. Setting this to an empty string will clear any existing
        port-name value.

     --timeout=TIMEOUT; default="5s"
        If Google Compute Engine doesn't receive a healthy response from the
        instance by the time specified by the value of this flag, the health
        check request is considered a failure. For example, specifying 10s will
        cause the check to wait for 10 seconds before considering the request a
        failure. The default value is 5s. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for
        information on duration formats.

     --unhealthy-threshold=UNHEALTHY_THRESHOLD; default=2
        The number of consecutive health check failures before a healthy
        instance is marked as unhealthy. The default is 2.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.
