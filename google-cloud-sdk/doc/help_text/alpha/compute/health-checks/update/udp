DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute health-checks update udp is used to update an
    existing UDP health check. Only arguments passed in will be updated on the
    health check. Other attributes will remain unaffected.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the UDP health check to update.

FLAGS
     --check-interval=CHECK_INTERVAL
        How often to perform a health check for an instance. For example,
        specifying 10s will run the check every 10 seconds. See $ gcloud topic
        datetimes for information on duration formats.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        A textual description for the UDP health check. Pass in an empty string
        to unset.

     --healthy-threshold=HEALTHY_THRESHOLD
        The number of consecutive successful health checks before an unhealthy
        instance is marked as healthy.

     --request=REQUEST
        Application data to send in payload of an UDP packet. It is an error if
        this is empty.

     --response=RESPONSE
        The bytes to match against the beginning of the response data. It is an
        error if this is empty.

     --timeout=TIMEOUT
        If Google Compute Engine doesn't receive a healthy response from the
        instance by the time specified by the value of this flag, the health
        check request is considered a failure. For example, specifying 10s will
        cause the check to wait for 10 seconds before considering the request a
        failure. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on duration
        formats.

     --unhealthy-threshold=UNHEALTHY_THRESHOLD
        The number of consecutive health check failures before a healthy
        instance is marked as unhealthy.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --global
          If set, the UDP health check is global.

       --region=REGION
          Region of the UDP health check to update. If not specified, you may
          be prompted to select a region.

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/region property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/region

          Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     These flags configure the port that the health check monitors. If both
     --port and --port-name are specified, --port takes precedence.

       --port=PORT
          The UDP port number that this health check monitors.

       --port-name=PORT_NAME
          The port name that this health check monitors. By default, this is
          empty.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

    This command is an internal implementation detail and may change or
    disappear without notice. This command is currently in ALPHA and may change
    without notice. If this command fails with API permission errors despite
    specifying the right project, you will have to apply for early access and
    have your projects registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so,
