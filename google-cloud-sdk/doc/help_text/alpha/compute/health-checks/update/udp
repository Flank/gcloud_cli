DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute health-checks update udp is used to update an
    existing UDP health check. Only arguments passed in will be updated on the
    health check. Other attributes will remain unaffected.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the UDP health check to update.

FLAGS
     --check-interval=CHECK_INTERVAL
        How often to perform a health check for an instance. For example,
        specifying 10s will run the check every 10 seconds. See $ gcloud topic
        datetimes for information on duration formats.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        A textual description for the UDP health check. Pass in an empty string
        to unset.

     --healthy-threshold=HEALTHY_THRESHOLD
        The number of consecutive successful health checks before an unhealthy
        instance is marked as healthy.

     --port=PORT
        The UDP port number that this health check monitors. The default is not
        set.

     --port-name=PORT_NAME
        The port name that this health check monitors. By default, this is
        empty. Setting this to an empty string will clear any existing
        port-name value.

     --request=REQUEST
        Application data to send in payload of an UDP packet. It is an error if
        this is empty.

     --response=RESPONSE
        The bytes to match against the beginning of the response data. It is an
        error if this is empty.

     --timeout=TIMEOUT
        If Google Compute Engine doesn't receive a healthy response from the
        instance by the time specified by the value of this flag, the health
        check request is considered a failure. For example, specifying 10s will
        cause the check to wait for 10 seconds before considering the request a
        failure. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on duration
        formats.

     --unhealthy-threshold=UNHEALTHY_THRESHOLD
        The number of consecutive health check failures before a healthy
        instance is marked as unhealthy.
