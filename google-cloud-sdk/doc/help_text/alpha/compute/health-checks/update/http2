DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute health-checks update http2 is used to update
    an existing HTTP2 health check. Only arguments passed in will be updated on
    the health check. Other attributes will remain unaffected.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        The name of the HTTP2 health check to update.

FLAGS
     --check-interval=CHECK_INTERVAL
        How often to perform a health check for an instance. For example,
        specifying 10s will run the check every 10 seconds. See $ gcloud topic
        datetimes for information on duration formats.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        A textual description for the HTTP2 health check. Pass in an empty
        string to unset.

     --healthy-threshold=HEALTHY_THRESHOLD
        The number of consecutive successful health checks before an unhealthy
        instance is marked as healthy.

     --host=HOST
        The value of the host header used in this HTTP health check request. By
        default, this is empty and Google Compute Engine automatically sets the
        host header in health requests to the same external IP address as the
        forwarding rule associated with the target pool. Setting this to an
        empty string will clear any existing host value.

     --port=PORT
        The TCP port number that this health check monitors.

     --port-name=PORT_NAME
        The port name that this health check monitors. By default, this is
        empty. Setting this to an empty string will clear any existing
        port-name value.

     --proxy-header=PROXY_HEADER
        The type of proxy protocol header to be sent to the backend.
        PROXY_HEADER must be one of:

         NONE
            No proxy header is added.
         PROXY_V1
            Adds the header "PROXY UNKNOWN\r\n".

     --request-path=REQUEST_PATH
        The request path that this health check monitors. For example,
        /healthcheck.

     --response=RESPONSE
        When empty, status code of the response determines health. When not
        empty, presence of specified string in first 1024 characters of
        response body determines health. Only ASCII characters allowed.

     --timeout=TIMEOUT
        If Google Compute Engine doesn't receive a healthy response from the
        instance by the time specified by the value of this flag, the health
        check request is considered a failure. For example, specifying 10s will
        cause the check to wait for 10 seconds before considering the request a
        failure. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on duration
        formats.

     --unhealthy-threshold=UNHEALTHY_THRESHOLD
        The number of consecutive health check failures before a healthy
        instance is marked as unhealthy.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

    users of ALPHA commands and flags need to apply for access, agree to
    applicable terms, and have their projects whitelisted. Contact Google or
