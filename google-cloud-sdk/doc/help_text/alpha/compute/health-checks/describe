NAME
    gcloud alpha compute health-checks describe - display detailed information
        about a health check

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute health-checks describe NAME
        [--global | --region=REGION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute health-checks describe displays all data
    associated with a Google Compute Engine health check in a project.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the health check to describe.

FLAGS
     At most one of these may be specified:

       --global
          If set, the health check is global.

       --region=REGION
          Region of the health check to describe. If not specified, you may be
          prompted to select a region.

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/region property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/region

          Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at

        $ gcloud compute health-checks describe
