DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute routers update is used to update a Google
    Compute Engine router.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the router to update.

FLAGS
     --advertisement-mode=MODE
        The new advertisement mode for this router. MODE must be one of:

         CUSTOM
            Custom (user-configured) BGP advertisements.
         DEFAULT
            Default (Google-managed) BGP advertisements.

     --async
        Display information about the operation in progress, without waiting
        for the operation to complete.

     --region=REGION
        Region of the router to update. If not specified, you may be prompted
        to select a region.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     --set-advertisement-groups=[GROUP,...]
        The list of pre-defined groups of IP ranges to dynamically advertise on
        this router. This list can only be specified in custom advertisement
        mode.

        GROUP must be (currently only one value is supported):

         ALL_SUBNETS
            Automatically advertise all available subnets.

     --set-advertisement-ranges=[CIDR_RANGE=DESC,...]
        The list of individual IP ranges, in CIDR format, to dynamically
        advertise on this router. Each IP range can (optionally) be given a
        text description DESC. For example, to advertise a specific range, use
        --set-advertisement-ranges=192.168.10.0/24. To store a description with
        the range, use --set-advertisement-ranges=192.168.10.0/24=my-networks.
        This list can only be specified in custom advertisement mode.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --add-advertisement-groups=[GROUP,...]
          A list of pre-defined groups of IP ranges to dynamically advertise on
          this router. This list is appended to any existing advertisements.
          This field can only be specified in custom advertisement mode.

          GROUP must be (currently only one value is supported):

       ALL_SUBNETS
          Automatically advertise all available subnets.

       --add-advertisement-ranges=[CIDR_RANGE=DESC,...]
          A list of individual IP ranges, in CIDR format, to dynamically
          advertise on this router. This list is appended to any existing
          advertisements. Each IP range can (optionally) be given a text
          description DESC. For example, to advertise a specific range, use
          --advertisement-ranges=192.168.10.0/24. To store a description with
          the range, use --advertisement-ranges=192.168.10.0/24=my-networks.
          This list can only be specified in custom advertisement mode.

       --remove-advertisement-groups=[GROUP,...]
          A list of pre-defined groups of IP ranges to remove from dynamic
          advertisement on this router. Each group in the list must exist in
          the current set of custom advertisements. This field can only be
          specified in custom advertisement mode.

          GROUP must be (currently only one value is supported):

       ALL_SUBNETS
          Automatically advertise all available subnets.

       --remove-advertisement-ranges=[CIDR_RANGE,...]
          A list of individual IP ranges, in CIDR format, to remove from
          dynamic advertisement on this router. Each IP range in the list must
          exist in the current set of custom advertisements. This field can
          only be specified in custom advertisement mode.

    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at

        $ gcloud compute routers update
        $ gcloud beta compute routers update
