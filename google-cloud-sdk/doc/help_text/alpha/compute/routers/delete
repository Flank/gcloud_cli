NAME
    gcloud alpha compute routers delete - delete Google Compute Engine routers

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha compute routers delete NAME [NAME ...] [--region=REGION]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha compute routers delete deletes one or more Google
    Compute Engine routers. Routers can only be deleted when no other resources
    (e.g., virtual machine instances) refer to them.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME [NAME ...]
        The names of the routers to delete.

FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        The region of the routers to delete. If not specified, you will be
        prompted to select a region.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.
