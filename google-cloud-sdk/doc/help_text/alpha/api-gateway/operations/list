NAME
    gcloud alpha api-gateway operations list - list API Gateway operations

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha api-gateway operations list [--location=LOCATION]
        [--filter=EXPRESSION] [--limit=LIMIT] [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) List API Gateway operations.

FLAGS
     Location resource - Parent location which operations will be listed from.
     This represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the [project]
     attribute: provide the argument [--location] on the command line with a
     fully specified name; Location for API and API Configs. Defaults to a
     wildcard with a fully specified name; provide the argument [--project] on
     the command line; set the property [core/project].

       --location=LOCATION
          ID of the location or fully qualified identifier for the location.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To list all operations, run:

        $ gcloud alpha api-gateway operations list

    To list all operations within the 'us-central1' location:

        $ gcloud alpha api-gateway operations list --location=us-central1

NOTES
    This command is an internal implementation detail and may change or
    disappear without notice. This command is currently in ALPHA and may change
    without notice. If this command fails with API permission errors despite
    specifying the right project, you may be trying to access an API with an
    invitation-only early access allowlist.
