     Privatecloud resource - privatecloud. The arguments in this group can be

     provide the argument [--project] on the command line. This must be
     specified.

       PRIVATECLOUD
          ID of the privatecloud or fully qualified identifier for the
          privatecloud. This positional must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          Region of the private cloud or cluster.

    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,

EXAMPLES
    To delete a private cloud called my-privatecloud in project my-project and
    location us-central1, run:

        $ gcloud alpha vmware privateclouds delete my-privatecloud \
            --project=my-project --location=us-central1

    Or:

        $ gcloud alpha vmware privateclouds delete my-privatecloud

    In the second example, the project and location are taken from gcloud
    properties core/project and vmware/location.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
