SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha vmware clusters delete

        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Delete a cluster in a VMware Engine private cloud.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Cluster resource - cluster. The arguments in this group can be used to
     specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not
     given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the
     [project] attribute: provide the argument [cluster] on the command line
     with a fully specified name; set the property [core/project]; provide the
     argument [--project] on the command line. This must be specified.

       CLUSTER
          ID of the cluster or fully qualified identifier for the cluster. This
          positional must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
          group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          Location of the privatecloud or cluster.

       --privatecloud=PRIVATECLOUD
          VMware privatecloud.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To delete a cluster called my-cluster in private cloud my-privatecloud and
    location us-central1, run:

        $ gcloud alpha vmware clusters delete my-cluster \
            --privatecloud=my-privatecloud --location=us-central1 \
            --project=my-project

    Or:

        $ gcloud alpha vmware clusters delete my-cluster \
            --privatecloud=my-privatecloud

    In the second example, the project and location are taken from gcloud
    properties core/project and vmware/location.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
