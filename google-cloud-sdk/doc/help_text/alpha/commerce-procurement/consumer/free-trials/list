DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Returns the List of Free Trial objects resulting from the List API.

FLAGS
     --filter=FILTER
        Filter that limits the list request.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Maximum number of resources per page.

     --page-token=PAGE_TOKEN
        Token that specifies the next page in the list.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    The filter is a query string that can match a selected set of attributes
    with string values. For example:

        $ gcloud alpha commerce-procurement consumer free-trials list \
          --filter "product_external_name=1234-5678-ABCD-EFG"

    Supported query attributes are the following:

      o product_external_name
      o provider (in the naming format of "provider/{provider-id}")

    If the query contains some special characters other than letters,
    underscore, or digits, the phrase must be quoted with double quotes. For
    example, where the product name needs to be quoted because it contains the
    special character colon:

        $ gcloud alpha commerce-procurement consumer free-trials list \
          --filter "product_external_name=\"foo:bar\""

    Queries can be combined with AND, OR, and NOT to form more complex queries.
    They can also be grouped to force a desired evaluation order. For example:

        $ gcloud alpha commerce-procurement consumer free-trials list \
          --filter \
          "provider=providers/E-1234 OR provider=providers/5678 AND NOT\
        (product_external_name=foo-product)"

    Connective AND can be omitted between two predicates. For example:

        $ gcloud alpha commerce-procurement consumer free-trials list \
          --filter "provider=providers/E-1234 product_external_name=foo"

    is equivalent to:

        $ gcloud alpha commerce-procurement consumer free-trials list \
          --filter \
          "provider=providers/E-1234 AND product_external_name=foo"

    This command is an internal implementation detail and may change or
    disappear without notice. This command is currently in ALPHA and may change
    without notice. If this command fails with API permission errors despite
    specifying the right project, you may be trying to access an API with an
    invitation-only early access allowlist.
