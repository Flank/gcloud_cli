SYNOPSIS

        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) (REMOVED) Returns information about a member's permissions on a

    This command lists the permissions that the current authenticated gcloud
    user has for a service. For example, if the authenticated user is able to
    delete the service, servicemanagement.services.delete will be among the
    returned permissions.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     SERVICE

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To check the permissions for the currently authenticated gcloud, run:

        $ gcloud alpha service-management check-iam-policy \
            my_produced_service_name
