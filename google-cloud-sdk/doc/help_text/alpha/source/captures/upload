NAME
    gcloud alpha source captures upload - upload a source capture from given
        input files

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha source captures upload PATH [--capture-id=ID]
        [--output-directory=OUTPUT_DIRECTORY; default="."] [--target-path=PATH]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) (REMOVED) Upload a source capture from given input files.

    This command has been removed.

    This command uploads a capture of the specified source directory to a
    Google-hosted Git repository accessible with the current project's
    credentials. If the name of an existing capture is provided, the existing
    capture will be modified to include the new files. Otherwise a new capture
    will be created to hold the files.

    When creating a capture, this command can also produce a source context
    json file describing the capture.

    See https://cloud.google.com/tools/cloud-debugger/ for details on where to
    deploy the source context json file in order to enable Cloud Diagnostic
    tools to display the captured sources.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     PATH
        The directory or archive containing the sources to capture. Files and
        subdirectories contained in that directory or archive will be added to
        the capture. If PATH refers to a file, the file may be a Java source
        jar or a zip archive.

FLAGS
     --capture-id=ID
        The ID of the capture to create or modify.

     --output-directory=OUTPUT_DIRECTORY; default="."
        The directory in which to create the source context file.

     --target-path=PATH
        The directory tree under source-location will be uploaded under
        target-path in the capture's directory tree.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is an internal implementation detail and may change or
    disappear without notice. This command is currently in ALPHA and may change
    without notice. Usually, users of ALPHA commands and flags need to apply
    for access, agree to applicable terms, and have their projects whitelisted.
