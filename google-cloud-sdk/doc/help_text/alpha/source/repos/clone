NAME
    gcloud alpha source repos clone - clone a cloud source repository

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha source repos clone REPOSITORY_NAME [DIRECTORY_NAME]
        [--dry-run] [--use-full-gcloud-path] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) This command clones a git repository from the currently active
    Google Cloud project into the specified directory or into the current
    directory if no target directory is specified.

    Each Google Cloud project can have zero or more git repositories associated
    with it. To see the available repositories, run:

        $ gcloud alpha source repos list

    The clone operation configures the local clone to use your gcloud
    credentials to authenticate future git operations. This command emits a
    warning if the cloud source repository is a mirror.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     REPOSITORY_NAME
        Name of the repository.

     [DIRECTORY_NAME]
        Directory name for the cloned repo. Defaults to the repository name.

FLAGS
     --dry-run
        If provided, prints the command that would be run to standard out
        instead of executing it.

     --use-full-gcloud-path
        If provided, use the full gcloud path for the git credential.helper.
        Using the full path means that gcloud does not need to be in the path
        for future git operations on the repository.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

EXAMPLES
    The example commands below show a sample workflow.

        $ gcloud init
        $ gcloud alpha source repos clone REPOSITORY_NAME DIRECTORY_NAME
        $ cd DIRECTORY_NAME
        ... create/edit files and create one or more commits ...
        $ git push origin master

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
    https://cloud.google.com/support/. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud source repos clone
        $ gcloud beta source repos clone
