NAME
    gcloud alpha cloud-shell ssh - allows you to establish an interactive SSH
        session with Cloud Shell

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha cloud-shell ssh [--command=COMMAND] [--dry-run]
        [--force-key-file-overwrite] [--ssh-flag=SSH_FLAG] [--ssh-key-file]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha cloud-shell ssh lets you remotely log in to Cloud
    Shell. If your Cloud Shell is not currently running, this will cause it to
    be started before establishing the SSH session.

FLAGS
     --command=COMMAND
        A command to run in Cloud Shell.

        Runs the command in Cloud Shell and then exits.

     --dry-run
        If provided, prints the command that would be run to standard out
        instead of executing it.

     --force-key-file-overwrite
        If enabled gcloud will regenerate and overwrite the files associated
        with a broken SSH key without asking for confirmation in both
        interactive and non-interactive environment.

        If disabled gcloud will not attempt to regenerate the files associated
        with a broken SSH key and fail in both interactive and non-interactive
        environment.

     --ssh-flag=SSH_FLAG
        Additional flags to be passed to ssh(1).

     --ssh-key-file
        The path to the SSH key file. By default, this is
        ~/.ssh/google_compute_engine.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

EXAMPLES
    To SSH into your Cloud Shell, run:

        $ gcloud alpha cloud-shell ssh

    To run a remote command in your Cloud Shell, run:

        $ gcloud alpha cloud-shell ssh --command=ls

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
