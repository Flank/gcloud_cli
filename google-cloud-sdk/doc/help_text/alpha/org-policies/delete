NAME
    gcloud alpha org-policies delete - delete an organization policy, or
        optionally only delete policy behavior defined under a condition

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha org-policies delete CONSTRAINT
        (--folder=FOLDER_ID | --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          | --project=PROJECT_ID) [--condition=CONDITION]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Deletes an organization policy, or optionally only deletes policy
    behavior defined under a condition. Specify the condition when calling the
    command to delete the policy behavior defined under that condition instead
    of the whole policy.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     CONSTRAINT
        Name of the org policy constraint. The list of available constraints
        can be found here:
        https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/org-policy-constraints

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Resource that is associated with the organization policy. Exactly one of
     these must be specified:

       --folder=FOLDER_ID
          Folder ID.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          Organization ID.

       --project=PROJECT_ID
          Project ID. Overrides the default core/project property value for
          this command invocation.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --condition=CONDITION
        Condition expression for filtering the resources the policy applies to.
        At the moment, the only allowed syntax for a condition is
        'resource.matchLabels(label_key_id, label_value_id)'.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

EXAMPLES
    To delete the policy associated with the constraint gcp.resourceLocations
    and the project foo-project, run:

        $ gcloud alpha org-policies delete gcp.resourceLocations \
             --project=foo-project

    To only delete the policy behavior defined for resources that have the
    label value 2222 associated with the label key 1111, run:

        $ gcloud alpha org-policies delete gcp.resourceLocations \
             --project=foo-project \
        --condition='resource.matchLabels(1111, 2222)'

NOTES
    This command is an internal implementation detail and may change or
    disappear without notice. This command is currently in ALPHA and may change
    without notice. If this command fails with API permission errors despite
    specifying the right project, you may be trying to access an API with an
    invitation-only early access whitelist.
