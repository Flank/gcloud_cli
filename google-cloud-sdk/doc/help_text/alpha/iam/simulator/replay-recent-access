NAME
    gcloud alpha iam simulator replay-recent-access - determine affected recent
        access attempts before IAM policy change deployment

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha iam simulator replay-recent-access RESOURCE POLICY_FILE
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Replay the most recent 5,000 access logs from the past 60 days
    using the simulated policy. For each log entry, the replay determines if
    setting the provided policy on the given resource would result in a change
    in the access state, e.g. a previously granted access becoming denied. Any
    differences found are returned.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     RESOURCE
        Full resource name to simulate the IAM policy for.

        See:
        https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names#full_resource_name.

     POLICY_FILE
        Path to a local JSON or YAML formatted file containing a valid policy.

        The output of the get-iam-policy command is a valid file, as is any
        JSON or YAML file conforming to the structure of a Policy. See the
        Policy reference
        (https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/Policy) for details.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To simulate a permission change of a member on a resource, run:

        $ gcloud alpha iam simulator replay-recent-access \
            projects/project-id path/to/policy_file.json

    See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details of
    policy role and member types.

NOTES
    This command is an internal implementation detail and may change or
    disappear without notice. This command is currently in ALPHA and may change
    without notice. If this command fails with API permission errors despite
    specifying the right project, you may be trying to access an API with an
    invitation-only early access allowlist.
