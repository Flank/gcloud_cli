NAME
    gcloud alpha iam service-accounts describe - show metadata for a service
        account from a project

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha iam service-accounts describe SERVICE_ACCOUNT
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) This command shows metadata for a service account.

    This call can fail for the following reasons:
      o The service account specified does not exist.
      o The active user does not have permission to access the given service
        account.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     SERVICE_ACCOUNT
        The service account to describe. The account should be formatted either
        as a numeric service account ID or as an email, like this:
        123456789876543212345 or my-iam-account@somedomain.com.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To print metadata for a service account from your project, run:

        $ gcloud alpha iam service-accounts describe \
            my-iam-account@somedomain.com

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud iam service-accounts describe
        $ gcloud beta iam service-accounts describe
