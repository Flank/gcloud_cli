NAME
    gcloud alpha iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding - add an IAM
        policy binding to an IAM Service Account

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding SERVICE_ACCOUNT
        --member=MEMBER --role=ROLE
        [--condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          | --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Add an IAM policy binding to a IAM Service Account. One binding
    consists of a member, a role, and an optional condition.

    When managing IAM roles, you can treat a service account either as a
    resource or as an identity. This command is to add iam policy bindings to a
    service account resource. There are other gcloud commands to manage IAM
    policies for other types of resources. For example, to manage IAM policies
    on a project, use the $ gcloud projects commands.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     ServiceAccount resource - The Service Account to which to add the IAM
     policy binding. This represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes
     are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set
     the [project] attribute: provide the argument [service_account] on the
     command line with a fully specified name; set the property [core/project];
     provide the argument [--project] on the command line. This must be
     specified.

       SERVICE_ACCOUNT
          ID of the serviceAccount or fully qualified identifier for the
          serviceAccount.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --member=MEMBER
        The member to add the binding for. Should be of the form
        user|group|serviceAccount:email or domain:domain.

        Examples: user:test-user@gmail.com, group:admins@example.com,
        serviceAccount:test123@example.domain.com, or
        domain:example.domain.com.

        Can also be one of the following special values:
        * allUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone who is on the
          internet, with or without a Google account.
        * allAuthenticatedUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone
          who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account.

     --role=ROLE
        Define the role of the member.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     At most one of these may be specified:

       --condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          Condition of the binding to be added. When condition is explicitly
          specified as None (e.g. --condition=None), a binding without a
          condition is added. When --condition is specified and is not a None
          condition, --role cannot be a primitive role. Primitive roles are
          roles/editor, roles/owner, and roles/viewer.

       expression
          (Required) Expression of the condition which evaluates to True or
          False. This uses a subset of Common Expression Language syntax.

       title
          (Required) Title for the expression, i.e. a short string describing
          its purpose.

       description
          (Optional) Description for the expression. This is a longer text
          which describes the expression.

          NOTE: An unsatisfied condition will not allow access via this
          binding.

       --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE
          Path to a local JSON or YAML file that defines the condition. To see
          available fields, see the help for --condition.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.
