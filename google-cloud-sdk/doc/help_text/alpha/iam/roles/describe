NAME
    gcloud alpha iam roles describe - show metadata for a role

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha iam roles describe ROLE_ID [--organization=ORGANIZATION]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) This command shows metadata for a role.

    This command can fail for the following reasons:
      o The role specified does not exist.
      o The active user does not have permission to access the given role.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     ROLE_ID
        The id of the role to describe. Curated roles example: roles/viewer.
        Custom roles example: CustomRole. For custom roles, you must also
        specify the --organization or --project flag.

FLAGS
     --organization=ORGANIZATION
        The organization of the role you want to describe.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To print metadata for a role of an organization, run:

        $ gcloud alpha iam roles describe --organization 1234567 viewer

    To print metadata for a role of a project, run:

        $ gcloud alpha iam roles describe --project myproject viewer

    To print metadata for a predefined role, run:

        $ gcloud alpha iam roles describe roles/viewer

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
    https://cloud.google.com/support/. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud iam roles describe
        $ gcloud beta iam roles describe
