NAME
    gcloud alpha composer - create and manage Cloud Composer Environments

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha composer GROUP [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Cloud Composer is a managed Apache Airflow service that helps you
    create, schedule, monitor and manage workflows. Cloud Composer automation
    helps you create Airflow environments quickly and use Airflow-native tools,
    such as the powerful Airflow web interface and command line tools, so you
    can focus on your workflows and not your infrastructure.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

GROUPS
    GROUP is one of the following:

     environments
        (ALPHA) Create and manage Cloud Composer environments.

     operations
        (ALPHA) Manage Cloud Composer operations.

        $ gcloud alpha composer environments --help
