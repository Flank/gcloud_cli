NAME
    gcloud alpha composer operations delete - delete one or more completed
        Cloud Composer operations

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha composer operations delete
        (OPERATIONS [OPERATIONS ...] : --location=LOCATION)
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Delete operations that are done. If more than one operation is
    specified, all deletes will be attempted. If any of the deletes fail, those
    operations and their failure messages will be listed on the standard error,
    and the command will exit with a non-zero status.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Operation resource - The operations to delete. The arguments in this group
     can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some
     attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other
     ways. To set the [project] attribute: provide the argument [operations] on
     the command line with a fully specified name; provide the argument
     [--project] on the command line; set the property [core/project]. This
     must be specified.

       OPERATIONS [OPERATIONS ...]
          IDs of the operations or fully qualified identifiers for the
          operations. This positional must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          Compute Engine region in which to create the operations.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access whitelist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud composer operations delete
        $ gcloud beta composer operations delete
