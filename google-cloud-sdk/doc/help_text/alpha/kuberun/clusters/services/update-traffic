NAME
    gcloud alpha kuberun clusters services update-traffic - updates the traffic
        settings of a Knative service

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha kuberun clusters services update-traffic SERVICE
        (--to-latest | --to-revisions=TO_REVISIONS) [--async]
        [--namespace=NAMESPACE]
        [--cluster=CLUSTER --cluster-location=CLUSTER_LOCATION
          | --context=CONTEXT --kubeconfig=KUBECONFIG] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Updates the traffic settings of a Knative service.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     SERVICE
        Knative service for which to update the traffic settings.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --to-latest
          If true, assign 100 percent of traffic to the 'latest' revision of
          this service. Note that when a new revision is created, it will
          become the 'latest' and traffic will be directed to it. Defaults to
          False. Synonymous with --to-revisions=LATEST=100.

       --to-revisions=TO_REVISIONS
          Comma-separated list of traffic assignments in the form
          REVISION-NAME=PERCENTAGE. REVISION-NAME must be the name for a
          revision for the service as returned by 'gcloud kuberun clusters
          revisions list'. PERCENTAGE must be an integer percentage between 0
          and 100 inclusive. E.g. service-nw9hs=10,service-nw9hs=20 Up to 100
          percent of traffic may be assigned. If 100 percent of traffic is
          assigned, the Service traffic is updated as specified. If under 100
          percent of traffic is assigned, the Service traffic is updated as
          specified for revisions with assignments and traffic is scaled up or
          down down proportionally as needed for revision that are currently
          serving traffic but that do not have new assignments. For example
          assume revision-1 is serving 40 percent of traffic and revision-2 is
          serving 60 percent. If revision-1 is assigned 45 percent of traffic
          and no assignment is made for revision-2, the service is updated with
          revsion-1 assigned 45 percent of traffic and revision-2 scaled down
          to 55 percent. You can use "LATEST" as a special revision name to
          always put the given percentage of traffic on the latest ready
          revision.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --namespace=NAMESPACE
        Kubernetes namespace to operate in.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --cluster=CLUSTER
          ID of the cluster or fully qualified identifier for the cluster. If
          specified, then --cluster-location is required. Cannot be specified
          together with --context and --kubeconfig. This flag must be specified
          if any of the other arguments in this group are specified.

       --cluster-location=CLUSTER_LOCATION
          Zone in which the cluster is located. If specified, then --cluster is
          required. Cannot be specified together with --context and
          --kubeconfig. This flag must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --context=CONTEXT
          Name of the context in your kubectl config file to use for
          connecting. Cannot be specified together with --cluster and
          --cluster-location.

       --kubeconfig=KUBECONFIG
          Absolute path to your kubectl config file. If not specified, the
          colon- or semicolon-delimited list of paths specified by $KUBECONFIG
          will be used. If $KUBECONFIG is unset, this defaults to
          ~/.kube/config. Cannot be specified together with --cluster and
          --cluster-location.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To send all traffic to the latest revision, run:

        $ gcloud alpha kuberun clusters services update-traffic --to-latest

    To split the traffic between revisions, run:

        $ gcloud alpha kuberun clusters services update-traffic \
          --to-revisions=rev1=30,rev2=70

    To change the traffic allocated for one revision and let the other
    revisions's traffic auto-resized:

        $ gcloud alpha kuberun clusters services update-traffic \
          --to-revisions=rev1=30

NOTES
    This command is an internal implementation detail and may change or
    disappear without notice. This command is currently in ALPHA and may change
    without notice. If this command fails with API permission errors despite
    specifying the right project, you may be trying to access an API with an
    invitation-only early access allowlist.
