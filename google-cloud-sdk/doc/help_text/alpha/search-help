NAME
    gcloud alpha search-help - search the help text of gcloud commands

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha search-help TERM [--filter=EXPRESSION]
        [--limit=LIMIT; default=5] [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE]
        [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]; default="~relevance"] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) (DEPRECATED) Search the help text of gcloud commands.

    search-help is deprecated. Please use gcloud help instead.

    Search the help text of gcloud commands for a term of interest. Prints the
    command name and a summary of the help text for any general release command
    whose help text contains the searched term.

    By default, results are sorted from most to least relevant, using a
    localized rating that is based on several heuristics and that may change in
    future runs of this command.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     TERM
        Term to search for.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT; default=5
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is 5. This flag
        interacts with other flags that are applied in this order: --flatten,
        --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]; default="~relevance"
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit. The
        default is ~relevance.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
