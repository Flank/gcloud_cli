NAME
    gcloud alpha scheduler jobs describe - show details about a job

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha scheduler jobs describe JOB [--view=VIEW; default="basic"]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Show details about a job.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     JOB
        The job you want to show details for.

FLAGS
     --view=VIEW; default="basic"
        The response_view specifies which subset of the Job will be returned.
        By default ListJobsRequest.response_view is Job.View.BASIC; not all
        information is retrieved by default because some data, such as
        payloads, might be desirable to return only when needed because of its
        large size or because of the sensitivity of data that it contains. VIEW
        must be one of: basic, full.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.
