NAME
    gcloud alpha logging tail - tail log entries

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha logging tail [LOG_FILTER] [--buffer-window=BUFFER_WINDOW]
        [--billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID | --folder=FOLDER_ID
          | --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID | --project=PROJECT_ID]
        [--bucket=BUCKET --location=LOCATION --view=VIEW]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha logging tail streams newly received log entries. Log
    entries matching log-filter are returned in the order that they were
    received by Cloud Logging. If the log entries come from multiple logs, then
    entries from different logs might be intermingled in the results. To help
    return log entries in order, use --buffer-window.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     [LOG_FILTER]
        Filter expression that specifies the log entries to return. A detailed
        guide on the Logging query language can be found at:
        https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/logging-query-language.overview

FLAGS
     --buffer-window=BUFFER_WINDOW
        The duration of time for which entries should be buffered for ordering
        before being returned. A longer buffer window helps to return logs in
        chronological order, but it also increases the latency from when
        entries are received by Cloud Logging to when they are returned. If
        unset, Cloud Logging will use 2s by default.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID
          Tail log entries associated with this billing account.

       --folder=FOLDER_ID
          Tail log entries associated with this folder.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          Tail log entries associated with this organization.

       --project=PROJECT_ID
          Tail log entries associated with this project.

          The Google Cloud Platform project ID to use for this invocation. If
          omitted, then the current project is assumed; the current project can
          be listed using gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)' and
          can be set using gcloud config set project PROJECTID.

          --project and its fallback core/project property play two roles in
          the invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate
          on. It also specifies the project for API enablement check, quota,
          and billing. To specify a different project for quota and billing,
          use --billing-project or billing/quota_project property.

     These arguments are used in conjunction with the parent to construct a
     view resource.

       --bucket=BUCKET
          Id of the bucket. If this argument is provided, then --location and
          --view must also be specified. This flag must be specified if any of
          the other arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          Location of the bucket. If this argument is provided, then --bucket
          and --view must also be specified. This flag must be specified if any
          of the other arguments in this group are specified.

       --view=VIEW
          Id of the view. If this argument is provided, then --location and
          --bucket must also be specified. This flag must be specified if any
          of the other arguments in this group are specified.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To stream log entries from Google Compute Engine instances, run:

        $ gcloud alpha logging tail "resource.type=gce_instance"

    To stream log entries with severity ERROR or higher, run:

        $ gcloud alpha logging tail "severity>=ERROR"

    To stream log entries with severity ERROR but only output the timestamps
    and instance IDs, run:

        $ gcloud alpha logging tail "severity>=ERROR" \
            --format="default(timestamp,resource["labels"]["instance_id"])"

    To stream with minimal latency but potentially incorrect ordering:

        $ gcloud alpha logging tail "resource.type=gce_instance" \
            --buffer-window=0s

    To stream up to 10 log entries in your project's syslog log from Compute
    Engine instances containing payloads that include the word SyncAddress and
    format the output in JSON format, run:

        $ gcloud alpha logging tail \
            "resource.type=gce_instance AND log_id(syslog) AND\
         textPayload:SyncAddress" --limit=10 --format=json

    To stream a log entry from a folder, run:

        $ gcloud alpha logging tail "resource.type=global" \
            --folder=[FOLDER_ID] --limit=1

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
