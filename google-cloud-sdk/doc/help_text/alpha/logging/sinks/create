SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha logging sinks create SINK_NAME DESTINATION
        [--include-children] [--log-filter=LOG_FILTER]
        [--billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID | --folder=FOLDER_ID
          | --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID]
        [--dlp-deidentify-template=DLP_DEIDENTIFY_TEMPLATE
          --dlp-inspect-template=DLP_INSPECT_TEMPLATE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Creates a sink used to export entries from one or more logs to a
    destination. A sink exports all logs that matches --log-filter flag. An
    empty filter matches all logs. The sink's destination can be a Cloud
    Storage bucket, a BigQuery dataset, or a Cloud Pub/Sub topic. The
    destination must already exist and Stackdriver Logging must have permission
    to write to it. Log entries are exported as soon as the sink is created.
    See
    https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/export/configure_export_v2#dest-auth.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     SINK_NAME
        The name for the sink.

     DESTINATION
        The destination for the sink.

FLAGS
     --include-children
        Whether to export logs from all child projects and folders. Only
        applies to sinks for organizations and folders.

     --log-filter=LOG_FILTER
        A filter expression for the sink. If present, the filter specifies
        which log entries to export.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID
          Create a sink associated with this billing account.

          Create a sink associated with this folder.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          Create a sink associated with this organization.

     Settings for Cloud DLP enabled sinks.

       --dlp-deidentify-template=DLP_DEIDENTIFY_TEMPLATE
          Relative path to a Cloud DLP de-identification template resource. For
          example "projects/my-project/deidentifyTemplates/my-template" or
          "organizations/my-org/deidentifyTemplates/my-template". This flag
          must be specified if any of the other arguments in this group are
          specified.

       --dlp-inspect-template=DLP_INSPECT_TEMPLATE
          Relative path to a Cloud DLP inspection template resource. For
          example "projects/my-project/inspectTemplates/my-template" or
          "organizations/my-org/inspectTemplates/my-template". This flag must
          be specified if any of the other arguments in this group are
          specified.

        my_dataset --log-filter='resource.type="gce_instance"'

    To export "syslog" from App Engine Flexible to Cloud Storage, run:

        $ gcloud alpha logging sinks create my-gcs-sink \
            storage.googleapis.com/my-bucket \
            --log-filter='logName="projects/my-project/appengine.googleapis.\
        com%2Fsyslog"'
