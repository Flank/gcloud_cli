SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Deletes a sink and halts the export of log entries associated with
    that sink. Deleting a sink does not affect log entries already exported
    through the deleted sink, and will not affect other sinks that are
    exporting the same log(s).

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     SINK_NAME
        The name of the sink to delete.

          Delete a sink associated with this billing account.

       --folder=FOLDER_ID
          Delete a sink associated with this folder.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          Delete a sink associated with this organization.

    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
