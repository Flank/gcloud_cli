DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Changes the [destination] or --log-filter associated with a sink.
    The new destination must already exist and Cloud Logging must have
    permission to write to it. Log entries are exported to the new destination
    immediately.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     SINK_NAME
        The name of the sink to update.

     [DESTINATION]
        A new destination for the sink. If omitted, the sink's existing
        destination is unchanged.

FLAGS
     --add-exclusion=[description=DESCRIPTION],[disabled=DISABLED],[filter=FILTER],[name=NAME]
        Add an exclusion filter for a log entry that is not to be exported.
        This flag can be repeated.

        The name and filter attributes are required. The following keys are
        accepted:

         name
            An identifier, such as load-balancer-exclusion. Identifiers are
            limited to 100 characters and can include only letters, digits,
            underscores, hyphens, and periods.

         description
            A description of this exclusion.

         filter
            An advanced log filter that matches the log entries to be excluded.

         disabled
            If this exclusion should be disabled and not exclude the log
            entries.
     --clear-exclusions
        Remove all logging exclusions.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Description of the sink.

     --disabled
        Disable the sink. Disabled sinks do not export logs.

     --log-filter=LOG_FILTER
        A new filter expression for the sink. If omitted, the sink's existing
        filter (if any) is unchanged.

     --remove-exclusions=[EXCLUSION ID,...]
        Specify the name of the Logging exclusion(s) to delete.

     --update-exclusion=[description=DESCRIPTION],[disabled=DISABLED],[filter=FILTER],[name=NAME]
        Update an exclusion filter for a log entry that is not to be exported.
        This flag can be repeated.

        The name and filter attributes are required. following keys are
        accepted:

         name
            An identifier, such as load-balancer-exclusion. Identifiers are
            limited to 100 characters and can include only letters, digits,
            underscores, hyphens, and periods.

         description
            A description of this exclusion.

         filter
            An advanced log filter that matches the log entries to be excluded.

         disabled
            If this exclusion should be disabled and not exclude the log
            entries.

     Settings for sink exporting data to BigQuery.

       --use-partitioned-tables
          If specified, use BigQuery's partitioned tables. By default, Logging
          creates dated tables based on the log entries' timestamps, e.g.
          'syslog_20170523'. Partitioned tables remove the suffix and special
          query syntax
          (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/querying-partitioned-tables)
          must be used.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID
          Update a sink associated with this billing account.

       --folder=FOLDER_ID
          Update a sink associated with this folder.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          Update a sink associated with this organization.

       --project=PROJECT_ID
          Update a sink associated with this project.

          The Google Cloud Platform project ID to use for this invocation. If
          omitted, then the current project is assumed; the current project can
          be listed using gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)' and
          can be set using gcloud config set project PROJECTID.

          --project and its fallback core/project property play two roles in
          the invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate
          on. It also specifies the project for API enablement check, quota,
          and billing. To specify a different project for quota and billing,
          use --billing-project or billing/quota_project property.

     Settings for Cloud DLP enabled sinks. If any of these arguments are
     omitted they are unchanged.

       --dlp-deidentify-template=DLP_DEIDENTIFY_TEMPLATE
          Relative path to a Cloud DLP de-identification template resource. For
          example "projects/my-project/deidentifyTemplates/my-template" or
          "organizations/my-org/deidentifyTemplates/my-template".

       --dlp-inspect-template=DLP_INSPECT_TEMPLATE
          Relative path to a Cloud DLP inspection template resource. For
          example "projects/my-project/inspectTemplates/my-template" or
          "organizations/my-org/inspectTemplates/my-template".

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To only update a sink filter, run:

        $ gcloud alpha logging sinks update my-sink \
            --log-filter='severity>=ERROR'

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud logging sinks update
        $ gcloud beta logging sinks update
