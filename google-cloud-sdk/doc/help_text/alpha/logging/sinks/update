DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Changes the [destination] or --log-filter associated with a sink.

    immediately.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     SINK_NAME
        The name of the sink to update.

        destination is unchanged.

FLAGS
     --log-filter=LOG_FILTER
        A new filter expression for the sink. If omitted, the sink's existing
        filter (if any) is unchanged.
