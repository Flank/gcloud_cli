NAME
    gcloud alpha logging cmek-settings update - updates the CMEK settings for
        the Stackdriver Logs Router

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha logging cmek-settings update --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
        (--clear-kms-key | [--kms-key-name=KMS_KEY_NAME
          : --kms-keyring=KMS_KEYRING
          --kms-location=KMS_LOCATION --kms-project=KMS_PROJECT])
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Use this command to update the --kms-key-name associated with the
    Stackdriver Logs Router.

    The Cloud KMS key must already exist and Stackdriver Logging must have
    permission to access it.

    Customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) for the Logs Router can currently
    only be configured at the organization-level and will apply to all projects
    in the organization.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
        Organization to update Logs Router CMEK settings for.

     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --clear-kms-key
          Disable CMEK for the Logs Router by clearing out Cloud KMS cryptokey
          in the organization's CMEK settings.

       Key resource - The Cloud KMS (Key Management Service) cryptokey that
       will be used to protect the logs being processed by the Stackdriver Logs
       Router. The Cloud KMS CryptoKey Encrypter/Decryper role must be assigned
       to the Stackdriver Logs Router service account. The arguments in this
       group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource.

         --kms-key-name=KMS_KEY_NAME
            ID of the key or fully qualified identifier for the key. This flag
            must be specified if any of the other arguments in this group are
            specified.

         --kms-keyring=KMS_KEYRING
            The KMS keyring of the key.

         --kms-location=KMS_LOCATION
            The Cloud location for the key.

         --kms-project=KMS_PROJECT
            The Cloud project for the key.

    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,

        $ gcloud alpha logging cmek-settings update \
            --organization=[ORGANIZATION_ID] \
            --kms-key-name='projects/my-project/locations/my-location/keyRin\
        gs/my-keyring/cryptoKeys/key'

    To disable CMEK for the Logs Router for an organization, run:

        $ gcloud alpha logging cmek-settings update \
