NAME
    gcloud alpha logging cmek-settings update - updates the CMEK settings for
        the Stackdriver Logs Router

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha logging cmek-settings update --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
        (--clear-kms-key | [--kms-key-name=KMS_KEY_NAME
          : --kms-keyring=KMS_KEYRING
          --kms-location=KMS_LOCATION --kms-project=KMS_PROJECT])
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Use this command to update the --kms-key-name associated with the
    Stackdriver Logs Router.

    The Cloud KMS key must already exist and Cloud Logging must have permission
    to access it.

    Customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) for the Logs Router can currently
    only be configured at the organization-level and will apply to all projects
    in the organization.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
        Organization to update Logs Router CMEK settings for.

     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --clear-kms-key
          Disable CMEK for the Logs Router by clearing out Cloud KMS cryptokey
          in the organization's CMEK settings.

       Key resource - The Cloud KMS (Key Management Service) cryptokey that
       will be used to protect the logs being processed by the Stackdriver Logs
       Router. The Cloud KMS CryptoKey Encrypter/Decryper role must be assigned
       to the Stackdriver Logs Router service account. The arguments in this
       group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource.

         --kms-key-name=KMS_KEY_NAME
            ID of the key or fully qualified identifier for the key. This flag
            must be specified if any of the other arguments in this group are
            specified.

         --kms-keyring=KMS_KEYRING
            The KMS keyring of the key.

         --kms-location=KMS_LOCATION
            The Cloud location for the key.

         --kms-project=KMS_PROJECT
            The Cloud project for the key.

    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,

EXAMPLES
    To enable CMEK for the Logs Router for an organization, run:

        $ gcloud alpha logging cmek-settings update \
            --organization=[ORGANIZATION_ID] \
            --kms-key-name='projects/my-project/locations/my-location/keyRin\
        gs/my-keyring/cryptoKeys/key'

    To disable CMEK for the Logs Router for an organization, run:

        $ gcloud alpha logging cmek-settings update \
            --organization=[ORGANIZATION_ID] --clear-kms-key

NOTES
    This command is an internal implementation detail and may change or
    disappear without notice. This command is currently in ALPHA and may change
    without notice. If this command fails with API permission errors despite
    specifying the right project, you may be trying to access an API with an
    invitation-only early access allowlist.
