SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha logging buckets undelete BUCKET_ID --location=LOCATION
        [--billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID | --folder=FOLDER_ID
          | --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID | --project=PROJECT_ID]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Undelete a bucket.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     BUCKET_ID
        ID of the bucket to undelete.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --location=LOCATION
        Location of the bucket.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     At most one of these may be specified:

       --billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID
          Undelete a bucket associated with this billing account.

       --folder=FOLDER_ID
          Undelete a bucket associated with this folder.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          Undelete a bucket associated with this organization.

       --project=PROJECT_ID
          Undelete a bucket associated with this project.

          The Google Cloud Platform project ID to use for this invocation. If
          omitted, then the current project is assumed; the current project can
          be listed using gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)' and
          can be set using gcloud config set project PROJECTID.

          --project and its fallback core/project property play two roles in
          the invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate
          on. It also specifies the project for API enablement check, quota,
          and billing. To specify a different project for quota and billing,
          use --billing-project or billing/quota_project property.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
