POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Execution resource - Name of the execution to wait on. The arguments in

     [execution] on the command line with a fully specified name; provide the
     argument [--project] on the command line; set the property [core/project].
     This must be specified.

       EXECUTION
          ID of the execution or fully qualified identifier for the execution.
          This positional must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          Cloud location for the execution. Alternatively, set the property
          [workflows/location].

          Workflow for the execution.

NOTES
    This command is an internal implementation detail and may change or
    disappear without notice. This command is currently in ALPHA and may change
    without notice. If this command fails with API permission errors despite
    specifying the right project, you may be trying to access an API with an
    invitation-only early access allowlist. This variant is also available:
