NAME
    gcloud alpha labelmanager keys add-iam-policy-binding - adds a policy
        binding to the IAM policy of a LabelKey

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha labelmanager keys add-iam-policy-binding
        (LABEL_KEY_ID : --label-parent=LABEL_PARENT) --member=MEMBER
        --role=ROLE
        [--condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          | --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Adds the IAM policy binding for a LabelKey resource given the
    binding and an identifier for the LabelKey. The identifier can be the
    LabelKey's display name and parent or the LabelKey's ID in the form:
    labelKeys/{numeric_id}.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     LabelKey. This must be specified.

       LABEL_KEY_ID
          Display name or numeric id for the LabelKey. The display name must be
          1-63 characters, beginning and ending with an alphanumeric character
          ([a-z0-9A-Z]) with dashes (-), underscores (), dots (.), and
          alphanumerics between. The numeric id should be of the form
          labelKeys/{numeric_id}. This positional must be specified if any of
          the other arguments in this group are specified.

       --label-parent=LABEL_PARENT
          Parent of the LabelKey. This must be the form organizations/{org_id}.
          This field is required if LABEL_KEY_ID is a display name instead of a
          numeric id.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --member=MEMBER
        The member to add the binding for. Should be of the form
        user|group|serviceAccount:email or domain:domain.

        Examples: user:test-user@gmail.com, group:admins@example.com,
        serviceAccount:test123@example.domain.com, or
        domain:example.domain.com.

        Can also be one of the following special values:
        * allUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone who is on the
          internet, with or without a Google account.
        * allAuthenticatedUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone
          who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account.

     --role=ROLE
        Define the role of the member.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     At most one of these may be specified:

       --condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          The condition of the binding to be added. When the condition is
          explicitly specified as None (--condition=None), a binding without a
          condition is added. When the condition is specified and is not None,
          --role cannot be a primitive role. Primitive roles are roles/editor,
          roles/owner, and roles/viewer.

       expression
          (Required) Expression of the condition which evaluates to True or
          False. This uses a subset of Common Expression Language syntax.

       title
          (Required) A short string describing the purpose of the expression.

       description
          (Optional) Additional description for the expression.

          NOTE: An unsatisfied condition will not allow access via this
          binding.

       --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE
          Path to a local JSON or YAML file that defines the condition. To see
          available fields, see the help for --condition.

    To add an IAM policy binding for a LabelKey with the name 'env' under
    'organization/456' for the role of 'roles/labelmanager.labelUser' for the
    user 'test-user@gmail.com', run:

        $ gcloud alpha labelmanager keys add-iam-policy-binding env \
            --label-parent='organizations/456' \
            --member='user:test-user@gmail.com' \
