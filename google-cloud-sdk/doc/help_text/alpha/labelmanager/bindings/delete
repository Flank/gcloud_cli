    gcloud alpha labelmanager bindings delete - deletes a LabelBinding

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha labelmanager bindings delete
        (LABEL_VALUE_ID : --label-key=LABEL_KEY --label-parent=LABEL_PARENT)
        --resource=RESOURCE [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Deletes a LabelBinding given the LabelValue and the resource that
    the LabelValue is bound to. The resource must be given as the full resource
    name. See:
    https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names#full_resource_name. The
    LabelValue can be represented with it's numeric id or with it's display
    name along with details on the parent LabelKey. The LabelKey's details can
    be passed as a numeric id or the display name along with the label-parent.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     LabelValue. This must be specified.

       LABEL_VALUE_ID
          Display name or numeric id for the LabelValue. The display name must
          be 1-63 characters, beginning and ending with an alphanumeric
          character ([a-z0-9A-Z]) with dashes (-), underscores (), dots (.),
          and alphanumerics between. The numeric id should be of the form
          labelValues/{numeric_id}. This positional must be specified if any of
          the other arguments in this group are specified.

       --label-key=LABEL_KEY
          Display name or numeric id of the parent LabelKey. Numeric ids should
          be of the form labelKeys/{numeric_id}. --label-key is required when
          using display name instead of numeric id for LABEL_VALUE_ID.

       --label-parent=LABEL_PARENT
          Parent of the LabelKey. This must be the form organizations/{org_id}.
          --label-parent is required when using display name instead of numeric
          id for the --label-key.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --resource=RESOURCE
        Full resource name of the resource that the LabelValue is bound to.
