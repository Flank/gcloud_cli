NAME
    gcloud alpha resources list - list Google Cloud resources accessible from
        your account

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha resources list [--filter=FILTER] [--limit=LIMIT]
        [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE; default=500] [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]] [--uri]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha resources list lists all indexed Google Cloud
    resources that you have access to. Filter expressions apply to the specific
    resource type selected. Currently, only a limited subset of Cloud resource
    types are supported.

FLAGS
     --filter=FILTER
        A filter expression that is rewritten into a CloudResourceSearch query
        expression. It is applied to the resource specific data in the search
        results.

        By default all indexed resources are listed. Use @type:COLLECTION to
        select resources for COLLECTION. It is an error to specify a COLLECTION
        not indexed by the API. The supported collections are:
        * cloudresourcemanager.projects
        * compute.disks
        * compute.healthChecks
        * compute.httpHealthChecks
        * compute.httpsHealthChecks
        * compute.images
        * compute.instanceGroups
        * compute.instances
        * compute.subnetworks
    Collections named resources.RESOURCE-TYPE may be used for debugging, where
    RESOURCE-TYPE is defined by the CloudResourceSearch API.

    See $ gcloud topic filters for filter expression details.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE; default=500
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is 500.
        Paging may be applied before or after --filter and --limit depending on
        the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --uri
        Print a list of resource URIs instead of the default output.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

EXAMPLES
    List all compute instances URIs with names starting with test or prod:

        $ gcloud alpha resources list --uri \
            --filter="@type:compute.instances name:(test prod)"

    Print the number of resources with any part containing the substring
    foobar:

        $ gcloud alpha resources list --filter="foobar" --uri | wc -l

    The previous command uses --uri to count because each output line is the
    URI for one resource. Otherwise the resource descriptions could be multiple
    lines per resource.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
    https://cloud.google.com/support/.
