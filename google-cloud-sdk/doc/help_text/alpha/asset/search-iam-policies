SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha asset search-iam-policies --query=QUERY

        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Searches accessible IAM policies that match a query.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --query=QUERY
        The query statement. To learn how to construct a query, see
        https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/searching-iam-policies#how_to_construct_a_query.

        Examples:
        * To find Cloud IAM policy bindings in your organization that contain
          amy@mycompany.com: policy : "amy@mydomain.com"
        * To find Cloud IAM policy bindings in your organization that contain
          the Owner role: policy : "roles/owner"
        * To find Cloud IAM policy bindings in your organization that have
          myuser@mycompany.com in the Owner role: policy : ("roles/owner"
          "myuser@mycompany.com")
        * To find Cloud IAM policy bindings in your organization that have
          myuser@mycompany.com in the Owner role or youruser@mycompany.com in
          the Viewer role: policy : (("roles/owner" "myuser@mycompany.com") OR
          ("roles/viewer" "youruser@mycompany.com"))
        * To find Cloud IAM policy bindings that are set on a resource:
          resource : "projects/123"
        * To find Cloud IAM policy bindings that are set on resources whose
          names contain substring "proj": resource : "*proj*"

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        The page size for search result pagination. The number of matching
        results may be fewer than requested based on the query. The maximum
        page size is 2000. If page-size is not given the back end will pick an
        appropriate default page size.

     --page-token=PAGE_TOKEN
        If present, retrieve the next batch of results from the preceding call
        to this method. page_token must be the value of next_page_token from
        the previous response. The values of all other method parameters must
        be identical to those in the previous call.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
