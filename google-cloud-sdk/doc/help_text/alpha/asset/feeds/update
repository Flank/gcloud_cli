DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Update an existing Cloud Asset Inventory Feed.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     FEED_ID
        Identifier of the asset feed to update, which must be unique in its
        parent resource. Parent resource can be a project, folder, or an
        organization.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --folder=FOLDER_ID
          Folder of the feed.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          Organization of the feed.

       --project=PROJECT_ID
          project of the feed.

          The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
          omitted, then the current project is assumed; the current project can
          be listed using gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)' and
          can be set using gcloud config set project PROJECTID.

          --project and its fallback core/project property play two roles in
          the invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate
          on. It also specifies the project for API enablement check, quota,
          and billing. To specify a different project for quota and billing,
          use --billing-project or billing/quota_project property.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --pubsub-topic=PUBSUB_TOPIC
        Name of the Cloud Pub/Sub topic to publish to, of the form
        projects/PROJECT_ID/topics/TOPIC_ID. You can list existing topics with
        gcloud pubsub topics list --format="text(name)"

     These flags modify the member assetNames of this Feed. See
     https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names#full_resource_name for
     more information. At most one of these may be specified:

       --add-asset-names=[ASSET-NAMES,...]
          Append the given values to the current assetNames.

       --clear-asset-names
          Empty the current assetNames.

       --remove-asset-names=[ASSET-NAMES,...]
          Remove the given values from the current assetNames.

     These flags modify the member assetTypes of this Feed. See
     https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/cloud-asset-inventory/overview
     for all supported asset types. At most one of these may be specified:

       --add-asset-types=[ASSET-TYPES,...]
          Append the given values to the current assetTypes.

       --clear-asset-types
          Empty the current assetTypes.

       --remove-asset-types=[ASSET-TYPES,...]
          Remove the given values from the current assetTypes.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --clear-content-type
          Clear any existing content type setting on the feed. Content type
          will be unspecified, no content but the asset name and type will be
          returned in the feed.

       --content-type=CONTENT_TYPE
          Asset content type to overwrite the existing one. To read more see:
          https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/cloud-asset-inventory/overview#asset_content_type.
          CONTENT_TYPE must be one of: resource, iam-policy, org-policy,
          access-policy.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES

        $ gcloud alpha asset feeds update feed1 --project=p1
        --add-asset-types=pubsub.googleapis.com/Topic

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access whitelist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud asset feeds update
        $ gcloud beta asset feeds update
