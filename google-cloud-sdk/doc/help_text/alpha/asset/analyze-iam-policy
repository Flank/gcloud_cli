DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) (REMOVED) This command has been removed. Please use gcloud beta

    Analyzes accessible IAM policies that match a request.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
        The organization ID to perform the analysis.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     Specifies a resource for analysis. Leaving it empty means ANY.

       --full-resource-name=FULL_RESOURCE_NAME
          The full resource name.

     Specifies an identity for analysis. Leaving it empty means ANY.

       --identity=IDENTITY
          The identity appearing in the form of members in the IAM policy
          binding.

     The analysis options.

       --expand-groups
          If true, the identities section of the result will expand any Google
          groups appearing in an IAM policy binding. Default is false.

       --expand-resources
          If true, the resource section of the result will expand any resource
          attached to an IAM policy to include resources lower in the resource
          hierarchy. Default is false.

       --expand-roles
          If true, the access section of result will expand any roles appearing
          in IAM policy bindings to include their permissions. Default is
          false.

       --output-group-edges
          If true, the result will output group identity edges, starting from
          the binding's group members, to any expanded identities. Default is
          false.

       --output-partial-result-before-timeout
          If true, you will get a response with a partial result instead of a
          DEADLINE_EXCEEDED error when your request processing takes longer
          than the deadline. Default is false.

       --output-resource-edges
          If true, the result will output resource edges, starting from the
          policy attached resource, to any expanded resources. Default is
          false.

     Specifies roles or permissions for analysis. Leaving it empty means ANY.

       --permissions=[PERMISSIONS,...]
          The permissions to appear in the result.

       --roles=[ROLES,...]
          The roles to appear in the result.

EXAMPLES
    To find out which users have been granted the iam.serviceAccounts.actAs
    permission on a specified service account, run:

        $ gcloud alpha asset analyze-iam-policy --organization=YOUR_ORG_ID \
            --full-resource-name=YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FULL_RESOURCE_NAME \
            --permissions='iam.serviceAccounts.actAs'

    To find out which resources a user can access, run:

        $ gcloud alpha asset analyze-iam-policy --organization=YOUR_ORG_ID \
            --identity='user:u1@foo.com'

    To find out which roles or permissions a user has been granted on a
    project, run:

        $ gcloud alpha asset analyze-iam-policy --organization=YOUR_ORG_ID \
            --full-resource-name=YOUR_PROJECT_FULL_RESOURCE_NAME \
            --identity='user:u1@foo.com'

NOTES
    This command is an internal implementation detail and may change or
    disappear without notice. This command is currently in ALPHA and may change
    without notice. If this command fails with API permission errors despite
    specifying the right project, you may be trying to access an API with an
    invitation-only early access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta asset analyze-iam-policy
