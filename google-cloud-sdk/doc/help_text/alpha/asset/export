NAME
    gcloud alpha asset export - export the cloud assets to Google Cloud Storage

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha asset export --output-path=OUTPUT_PATH
        [--asset-types=[ASSET_TYPES,...]] [--content-type=CONTENT_TYPE]
        [--organization=ORGANIZATION_ID] [--snapshot-time=SNAPSHOT_TIME]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Export the cloud assets to Google Cloud Storage.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --output-path=OUTPUT_PATH
        Google Cloud Storage URI where the results will go. URI must start with
        "gs://". For example, "gs://bucket_name/object_name"

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --asset-types=[ASSET_TYPES,...]
        A list of asset types (i.e., "google.compute.Disk") to take a snapshot.
        If specified and non-empty, only assets matching the specified types
        will be returned.

     --content-type=CONTENT_TYPE
        Asset content type. If specified, only content matching the specified
        type will be returned. Otherwise, no content but the asset name will be
        returned. Choices are resource, iam-policy. Specifying resource will
        export resource metadata, and specifying iam-policy will export IAM
        policy set on assets. CONTENT_TYPE must be one of: resource,
        iam-policy.

     --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
        The ID of the organization which is the root asset.

     --snapshot-time=SNAPSHOT_TIME
        Timestamp to take a snapshot on assets. This could only be a current or
        past time. If not specified, the current time will be used. Due to
        delays in resource data collection and indexing, there is a volatile
        window during which running the same query at different time may return
        different results. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on time
        formats.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
