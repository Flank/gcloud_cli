NAME
    gcloud alpha asset export - export the cloud assets to Google Cloud Storage

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha asset export
        (--output-path=OUTPUT_PATH | --output-path-prefix=OUTPUT_PATH_PREFIX)
        [--asset-types=[ASSET_TYPES,...]] [--content-type=CONTENT_TYPE]
        [--snapshot-time=SNAPSHOT_TIME]
        [--folder=FOLDER_ID | --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Export the cloud assets to Google Cloud Storage. Use gcloud asset
    operations describe to get the latest status of the operation. Note that to
    export a project different from the project you want to bill, you can
    either explicitly set the billing/quota_project property or authenticate
    with a service account. See
    https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/cloud-asset-inventory/gcloud-asset
    for examples of using a service account.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     The destination path for exporting assets. Exactly one of these must be
     specified:

       --output-path=OUTPUT_PATH
          Google Cloud Storage URI where the results will go. URI must start
          with "gs://". For example, "gs://bucket_name/object_name"

       --output-path-prefix=OUTPUT_PATH_PREFIX
          Google Cloud Storage URI where the results will go. URI must start
          with "gs://". For example, "gs://bucket_name/object_name_prefix", in
          which case each exported object uri is in format:
          "gs://bucket_name/object_name_prefix/<asset type>/<shard number>" and
          it only contains assets for that type.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --asset-types=[ASSET_TYPES,...]
        A list of asset types (i.e., "compute.googleapis.com/Disk") to take a
        snapshot. If specified and non-empty, only assets matching the
        specified types will be returned. See
        https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/cloud-asset-inventory/overview
        for supported asset types.

     --content-type=CONTENT_TYPE
        Asset content type. If specified, only content matching the specified
        type will be returned. Otherwise, no content but the asset name will be
        returned. Choices are resource, iam-policy. Specifying resource will
        export resource metadata, and specifying iam-policy will export IAM
        policy set on assets. CONTENT_TYPE must be one of: resource,
        iam-policy.

     --snapshot-time=SNAPSHOT_TIME
        Timestamp to take a snapshot on assets. This can only be a current or
        past time. If not specified, the current time will be used. Due to
        delays in resource data collection and indexing, there is a volatile
        window during which running the same query at different times may
        return different results. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information
        on time formats.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --folder=FOLDER_ID
          The ID of the folder which is the root asset.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          The ID of the organization which is the root asset.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

EXAMPLES
    To export a snapshot of assets of type 'compute.googleapis.com/Disk' in
    project 'test-project' at '2019-03-05T00:00:00Z' to
    'gs://bucket-name/object-name' and only export the asset metadata, run:

        $ gcloud alpha asset export --project='test-project' \
            --asset-types='compute.googleapis.com/Disk' \
            --snapshot-time='2019-03-05T00:00:00Z' \
            --output-path='gs://bucket-name/object-name' \
            --content-type='resource'

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
    https://cloud.google.com/support/. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud asset export
        $ gcloud beta asset export
