NAME
    gcloud alpha endpoints operations describe - describes an operation
        resource for a given operation name

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha endpoints operations describe OPERATION [--full]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) This command will return information about an operation given the
    name of that operation.

    The amount of information inside an operation can be very large, so by
    default, only a summary is returned. If you want the entire operation
    resource, you can include the --full flag.

    Note that the operations/ prefix of the operation name is optional and may
    be omitted.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     OPERATION
        The name of the operation to describe.

FLAGS
     --full
        Print the entire operation resource, which could be large. By default,
        a summary will be printed instead.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

EXAMPLES
    To describe an operation resource named
    operations/serviceConfigs.my-service.1, run:

        $ gcloud alpha endpoints operations describe \
            serviceConfigs.my-service.1

    To get the full operation resource, run:

        $ gcloud alpha endpoints operations describe \
            serviceConfigs.my-service.1 --full

    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
