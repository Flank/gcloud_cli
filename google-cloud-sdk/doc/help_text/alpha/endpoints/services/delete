NAME
    gcloud alpha endpoints services delete - deletes a service from Google
        Service Management

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha endpoints services delete SERVICE [--async]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Services that are deleted will be retained in the system for 30
    days. If a deleted service is still within this retention window, it can be
    undeleted with the undelete command.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     SERVICE
        The name of the service to delete.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To delete a service named my-service, run:

        $ gcloud alpha endpoints services delete my-service

    To run the same command asynchronously (non-blocking), run:

        $ gcloud alpha endpoints services delete my-service --async

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access whitelist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud endpoints services delete
        $ gcloud beta endpoints services delete
