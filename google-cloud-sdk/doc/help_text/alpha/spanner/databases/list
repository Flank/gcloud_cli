SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha spanner databases list [--instance=INSTANCE]

        [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]] [--uri] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) List the Cloud Spanner databases contained within the given
    instance.

FLAGS
     Instance resource - The Cloud Spanner instance in which to list databases.
     This represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the [project]
     attribute: provide the flag [--instance] on the command line with a fully
     specified name; set the property [spanner/instance] with a fully specified
     name; provide the flag [--project] on the command line; set the property
     [core/project].

       --instance=INSTANCE
          The ID of the instance or a fully qualified identifier for the
          instance.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --uri
        Print a list of resource URIs instead of the default output.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
    https://cloud.google.com/support/. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud spanner databases list
        $ gcloud beta spanner databases list
