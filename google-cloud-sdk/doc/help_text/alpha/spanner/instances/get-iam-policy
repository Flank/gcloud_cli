NAME
    gcloud alpha spanner instances get-iam-policy - get the IAM policy for a
        Cloud Spanner instance

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha spanner instances get-iam-policy INSTANCE
        [--filter=EXPRESSION] [--limit=LIMIT] [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE]
        [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) gcloud alpha spanner instances get-iam-policy displays the IAM
    policy associated with a Cloud Spanner instance. If formatted as JSON, the
    output can be edited and used as a policy file for set-iam-policy. The
    output includes an "etag" field identifying the version emitted and
    allowing detection of concurrent policy updates; see $ {parent}
    set-iam-policy for additional details.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Instance resource - The Cloud Spanner instance for which to display the
     IAM policy. This represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are
     not given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the
     [project] attribute: provide the flag [instance] on the command line with
     a fully specified name; provide the flag [--project] on the command line;
     set the property [core/project]. This must be specified.

       INSTANCE
          The ID of the instance or a fully qualified identifier for the
          instance.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        The maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        A comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.
