NAME
    gcloud alpha remote-build-execution worker-pools update - update a Remote
        Build Execution worker pool

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha remote-build-execution worker-pools update
        (WORKERPOOL : --instance=INSTANCE) [--async] [--disk-size=DISK_SIZE]
        [--machine-type=MACHINE_TYPE] [--worker-count=WORKER_COUNT]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Updates the configuration of a Remote Build Execution worker pool.
    This can be used to change the size of the worker pool, change the type of
    machine, or adjust the disk size of the worker VMs.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Workerpool resource - Arguments and flags specifying the worker pool to
     update. The arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes
     of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this
     group but can be set in other ways. To set the [project] attribute:
     provide the argument [workerpool] on the command line with a fully
     specified name; provide the argument [--project] on the command line; set
     the property [core/project]. This must be specified.

       WORKERPOOL
          ID of the workerpool or fully qualified identifier for the
          workerpool. This positional must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --instance=INSTANCE
          Instance name.

FLAGS
     --async
        Display information about the operation in progress, without waiting
        for the operation to complete.

     --disk-size=DISK_SIZE
        Size of the disk, in Gb, for each worker. Defaults to 200Gb.

     --machine-type=MACHINE_TYPE
        The type of VM to use for each worker. To get a list of valid machine
        types, use the following command:

        $ gcloud compute machine-types list

     --worker-count=WORKER_COUNT
        Number of workers that should be in the worker pool.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the remotebuildexecution/v1alpha API. The full
    documentation for this API can be found at:
    https://cloud.google.com/remote-build-execution/docs/

EXAMPLES
    The following command adjusts the nubmer of workers to 50 in a pool called
    'pool1' contained in the instance 'default_instance':

        $ gcloud alpha remote-build-execution worker-pools update pool1 \
            --instance=default_instance --worker-count=50

    The following command adjusts the configuration of the workers within the
    pool, changing the machine type to standard 4 core machines with 500 GB
    disks.

        $ gcloud alpha remote-build-execution worker-pools update pool1 \
            --instance=default_instance --disk-size=500 \
            --machine-type=n1-standard-4

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
