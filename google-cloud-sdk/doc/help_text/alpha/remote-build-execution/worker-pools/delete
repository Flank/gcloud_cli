NAME
    gcloud alpha remote-build-execution worker-pools delete - delete a worker
        pool from a specified instance

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha remote-build-execution worker-pools delete
        (WORKERPOOL : --instance=INSTANCE) [--async] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Delete a worker pool from a specified instance.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Workerpool resource - Arguments and parameters that specify the worker
     pool to delete. The arguments in this group can be used to specify the
     attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the [project]
     attribute: provide the argument [workerpool] on the command line with a
     fully specified name; provide the argument [--project] on the command
     line; set the property [core/project]. This must be specified.

       WORKERPOOL
          ID of the workerpool or fully qualified identifier for the
          workerpool. This positional must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --instance=INSTANCE
          Instance name.

FLAGS
     --async
        Display information about the operation in progress, without waiting
        for the operation to complete.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the remotebuildexecution/v1alpha API. The full
    documentation for this API can be found at:
    https://cloud.google.com/remote-build-execution/docs/

EXAMPLES
    The following command deletes the workerpool called 'pool' from the
    instance called 'default_instance':

        $ gcloud alpha remote-build-execution worker-pools delete pool \
            --instance=default_instance

    Rather than passing the worker pool and instance as separate parameters,
    you can pass the worker pool as a resource, like so:

        $ gcloud alpha remote-build-execution worker-pools delete \
            projects/{projectId}/instance/default_instance/workerpools/pool

    where {projectId} is the ID of the Cloud Platform project that contains the
    instance.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
    https://cloud.google.com/support/.
