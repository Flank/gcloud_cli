API REFERENCE
    This command uses the remotebuildexecution/v1alpha API. The full
    documentation for this API can be found at:
    https://cloud.google.com/remote-build-execution/docs/

EXAMPLES
    The following will describe the instance named 'instance1' for the active
    project:

        $ gcloud alpha remote-build-execution instances describe instance1

    You can also provide the fully qualified resource name for the instance
    like so:

        $ gcloud alpha remote-build-execution instances describe \
            projects/my_project/instances/instance1

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
