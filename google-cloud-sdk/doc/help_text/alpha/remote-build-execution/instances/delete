SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha remote-build-execution instances delete INSTANCE [--async]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Deletes the instance, as well as all worker pools, cached build
    inputs and cached build artifacts contained within that instance.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Instance resource - Arguments and flags specifying the instance you want
     to delete. This represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are
     not given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the
     [project] attribute: provide the argument [instance] on the command line
     with a fully specified name; provide the argument [--project] on the
     command line; set the property [core/project]. This must be specified.

       INSTANCE
          ID of the instance or fully qualified identifier for the instance.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the remotebuildexecution/v1alpha API. The full
    documentation for this API can be found at:
    https://cloud.google.com/remote-build-execution/docs/

EXAMPLES
    The following will delete the instance named 'instance_to_delete':

        $ gcloud alpha remote-build-execution instances delete \
            instance_to_delete

    You can also provide the fully qualified resource name for the instance
    like so:

        $ gcloud alpha remote-build-execution instances delete \
            projects/my_project/instances/instance_to_delete

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist.
