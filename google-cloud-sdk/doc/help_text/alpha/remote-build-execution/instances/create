DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Creates a Remote Build Execution instance, which contains a remote
    cache and can contain worker pools for execution of build and test actions.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Instance resource - Arguments describing the instance to create. This
     represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the [project]
     attribute: provide the argument [instance] on the command line with a
     fully specified name; provide the argument [--project] on the command
     line; set the property [core/project]. This must be specified.

       INSTANCE

        complete.

     --location=LOCATION; default="us-central1"
        The Cloud location to create the instance in. Currently this can only
        be 'us-central1'.
