NAME
    gcloud alpha emulators pubsub - manage your local pubsub emulator

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha emulators pubsub COMMAND [--data-dir=DATA_DIR]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) This set of commands allows you to start and use a local Pub/Sub
    emulator to produce a local emulation of your production Google Pub/Sub
    environment. In addition to having Java JRE (of version 7 or higher)
    installed and an application built with Google Cloud Client libraries, you
    must have your emulator configured (have it started with environment
    variables set) for it to run successfully. The underlying commands help to
    set up this configuration.

    To stop the emulator, press Ctrl+C.

    For a more comprehensive overview of Pub/Sub, see
    https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/overview. For Pub/Sub emulator
    specific documentation, see https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/emulator

FLAGS
     --data-dir=DATA_DIR
        The directory to be used to store/retrieve data/config for an emulator
        run. The default value is <USER_CONFIG_DIR>/emulators/pubsub. The value
        of USER_CONFIG_DIR can be found by running:

            $ gcloud info --format='get(config.paths.global_config_dir)'

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

COMMANDS
    COMMAND is one of the following:

     env-init
        (ALPHA) Print the commands required to export pubsub emulator's env
        variables.

     start
        (ALPHA) Start a local pubsub emulator.

EXAMPLES
    To start a local pubsub emulator with the default directory for
    configuration data, run:

        $ gcloud alpha emulators pubsub start

    After starting the emulator, if your application and emulator run on the
    same machine, set environment variables automatically by running:

        $ gcloud alpha emulators pubsub env-init

    If you're running your emulator on a different machine, run the above
    command and use its resulting output to set the environment variables on
    the machine that runs your application. This might look like:

        $ export PUBSUB_EMULATOR_HOST=localhost:8538
        $ export PUBSUB_PROJECT_ID=my-project-id

    Your emulator is now ready for use.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
    https://cloud.google.com/support/. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta emulators pubsub
