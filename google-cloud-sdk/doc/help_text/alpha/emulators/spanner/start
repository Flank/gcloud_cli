NAME
    gcloud alpha emulators spanner start - start a local Cloud Spanner emulator

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha emulators spanner start
        [--enable-fault-injection=ENABLE_FAULT_INJECTION]
        [--host-port=HOST_PORT] [--rest-port=REST_PORT]
        [--use-docker=USE_DOCKER] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) This command starts a local Cloud Spanner emulator.

FLAGS
     --enable-fault-injection=ENABLE_FAULT_INJECTION
        If true, the emulator will randomly inject faults into transactions.
        This facilitates application abort-retry testing.

     --host-port=HOST_PORT
        The host:port to which the emulator should be bound. The default value
        is localhost:9010. Note that this port serves gRPC requests. To
        override the default port serving REST requests, use --rest-port. If
        using Docker to run the emulator, the host must be specified as an
        ipaddress.

     --rest-port=REST_PORT
        The port at which REST requests are served. gcloud uses REST to
        communicate with the emulator. The default value is 9020.

     --use-docker=USE_DOCKER
        Use the cloud spanner emulator docker image even if the platform has a
        native binary available in the sdk. Currently we only provide a native
        binary for Linux. For other systems, you must install docker for your
        platform before starting the emulator.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To start a local Cloud Spanner emulator, run:

        $ gcloud alpha emulators spanner start

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta emulators spanner start
