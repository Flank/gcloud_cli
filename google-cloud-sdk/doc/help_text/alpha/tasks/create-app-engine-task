DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Create and add a task to an App Engine queue.

FLAGS
     --header=HEADER_FIELD: HEADER_VALUE
        An HTTP request header. Header values can contain commas. This flag can
        be repeated. Repeated header fields will have their values overridden.

     --id=TASK_ID
        The ID of the task to create.

        If not specified then the system will generate a random unique task ID.
        Explicitly specifying a task ID enables task de-duplication. If a
        task's ID is identical to that of an existing task or a task that was
        deleted or completed recently then the call will fail.

        Because there is an extra lookup cost to identify duplicate task names,
        tasks created with IDs have significantly increased latency. Using
        hashed strings for the task ID or for the prefix of the task ID is
        recommended.

     --method=METHOD
        The HTTP method to use for the request. If not specified, "POST" will
        be used.

     --queue=QUEUE
        The queue the task belongs to.

     --routing=KEY:VALUE,[KEY:VALUE,...]
        The route to be used for this task. KEY must be at least one of:
        [service, version, instance]. Any missing keys will use the default.

        Routing can be overridden by the queue-level --routing-override flag.

     --schedule-time=SCHEDULE_TIME
        The time when the task is scheduled to be first attempted. Defaults to
        "now" if not specified.

     --url=URL
        The relative URL of the request. Must begin with "/" and must be a
        valid HTTP relative URL. It can contain a path and query string
        arguments. If not specified, then the root path "/" will be used.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --payload-content=PAYLOAD_CONTENT
          Data payload to be consumed by the task worker to process the task.

       --payload-file=PAYLOAD_FILE
          File containing data payload to be consumed by the task worker to
          execute the task. The payload will be sent as the HTTP message body.
          A message body, and thus a payload, is allowed only if the HTTP
          method is "POST" or "PUT".

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

    users of ALPHA commands and flags need to apply for access, agree to
    applicable terms, and have their projects whitelisted. Contact Google or
