NAME
    gcloud alpha tasks create-pull-task - create and add a task to a pull queue

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha tasks create-pull-task [TASK_ID] --queue=QUEUE
        [--schedule-time=SCHEDULE_TIME] [--tag=TAG]
        [--payload-content=PAYLOAD_CONTENT | --payload-file=PAYLOAD_FILE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Create and add a task to a pull queue.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     [TASK_ID]
        The task to create.

        If not specified then the system will generate a random unique task ID.
        Explicitly specifying a task ID enables task de-duplication. If a
        task's ID is identical to that of an existing task or a task that was
        deleted or completed recently then the call will fail.

        Because there is an extra lookup cost to identify duplicate task names,
        tasks created with IDs have significantly increased latency. Using
        hashed strings for the task ID or for the prefix of the task ID is
        recommended.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --queue=QUEUE
        The queue the task belongs to.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --schedule-time=SCHEDULE_TIME
        The time when the task is scheduled to be first attempted. Defaults to
        "now" if not specified.

     --tag=TAG
        An optional label used to group similar tasks.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --payload-content=PAYLOAD_CONTENT
          Data payload used by the task worker to process the task.

       --payload-file=PAYLOAD_FILE
          File containing data payload used by the task worker to process the
          task.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
