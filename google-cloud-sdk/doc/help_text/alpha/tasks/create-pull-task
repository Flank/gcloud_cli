NAME
    gcloud alpha tasks create-pull-task - create and add a task to a pull queue

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha tasks create-pull-task [--id=TASK_ID] [--queue=QUEUE]
        [--schedule-time=SCHEDULE_TIME] [--tag=TAG]
        [--payload-content=PAYLOAD_CONTENT | --payload-file=PAYLOAD_FILE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Create and add a task to a pull queue.

FLAGS
     --id=TASK_ID
        The ID of the task to create.

        If not specified then the system will generate a random unique task ID.
        Explicitly specifying a task ID enables task de-duplication. If a
        task's ID is identical to that of an existing task or a task that was
        deleted or completed recently then the call will fail.

        Because there is an extra lookup cost to identify duplicate task names,
        tasks created with IDs have significantly increased latency. Using
        hashed strings for the task ID or for the prefix of the task ID is
        recommended.

     --queue=QUEUE
        The queue the task belongs to.

     --schedule-time=SCHEDULE_TIME
        The time when the task is scheduled to be first attempted. Defaults to
        "now" if not specified.

     --tag=TAG
        An optional label used to group similar tasks.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --payload-content=PAYLOAD_CONTENT
          Data payload to be consumed by the task worker to process the task.

       --payload-file=PAYLOAD_FILE
          File containing data payload to be consumed by the task worker to
          execute the task. The payload will be sent as the HTTP message body.
          A message body, and thus a payload, is allowed only if the HTTP
          method is "POST" or "PUT".

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
