    gcloud alpha tasks queues update-pull-queue - update a pull queue

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha tasks queues update-pull-queue QUEUE
        [--clear-max-attempts | --max-attempts=MAX_ATTEMPTS]
        [--clear-max-retry-duration | --max-retry-duration=MAX_RETRY_DURATION]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) The flags available to this command represent the fields of a pull
    queue that are mutable. Attempting to use this command on a different type
    of queue will result in an error.

    For more information about the different queue target types, see:
    https://cloud.google.com/cloud-tasks/docs/queue-types

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     QUEUE
        The queue to update.

FLAGS
     At most one of these may be specified:

       --clear-max-attempts
          Clear the field corresponding to --max-attempts.

       --max-attempts=MAX_ATTEMPTS
          The maximum number of attempts per task in the queue.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --clear-max-retry-duration
          Clear the field corresponding to --max-retry-duration.

       --max-retry-duration=MAX_RETRY_DURATION
          The time limit for retrying a failed task, measured from when the
          task was first run. Once the --max-retry-duration time has passed and
          the task has been attempted --max-attempts times, no further attempts
          will be made and the task will be deleted.

          Must be a string that ends in 's', such as "5s".

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.
