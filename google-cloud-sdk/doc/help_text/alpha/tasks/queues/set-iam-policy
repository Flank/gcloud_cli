NAME
    gcloud alpha tasks queues set-iam-policy - set the IAM policy for a queue

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha tasks queues set-iam-policy (QUEUE : --location=LOCATION)
        POLICY_FILE [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) This command replaces the existing IAM policy for a queue, given a
    queue and a file encoded in JSON or YAML that contains the IAM policy. If
    the given policy file specifies an "etag" value, then the replacement will
    succeed only if the policy already in place matches that etag. (An etag
    obtained via get-iam-policy will prevent the replacement if the policy for
    the queue has been subsequently updated.) A policy file that does not
    contain an etag value will replace any existing policy for the queue.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Queue resource - The queue for which to set the IAM policy. The arguments
     in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource.
     (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be
     set in other ways. To set the [project] attribute: Set the property
     [core/project] or provide the flag [--project] on the command line. This
     must be specified.

       QUEUE
          The ID of the queue or a fully qualified identifier for the queue.
          This positional must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location name.

     POLICY_FILE
        Path to a local JSON or YAML formatted file containing a valid policy.
