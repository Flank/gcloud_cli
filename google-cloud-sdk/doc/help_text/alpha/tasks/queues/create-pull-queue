SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha tasks queues create-pull-queue QUEUE
        [--max-attempts=MAX_ATTEMPTS] [--max-retry-duration=MAX_RETRY_DURATION]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) The flags available to this command represent the fields of a pull
    queue that are mutable.

    If you have early access to Cloud Tasks, refer to the following guide for
    more information about the different queue target types:
    https://cloud.google.com/cloud-tasks/docs/queue-types. For access, sign up

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     QUEUE
        The queue to create.

FLAGS
     --max-attempts=MAX_ATTEMPTS
        The maximum number of attempts per task in the queue.

     --max-retry-duration=MAX_RETRY_DURATION
        The time limit for retrying a failed task, measured from when the task
        was first run. Once the --max-retry-duration time has passed and the
        task has been attempted --max-attempts times, no further attempts will
        be made and the task will be deleted.

        Must be a string that ends in 's', such as "5s".

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.
