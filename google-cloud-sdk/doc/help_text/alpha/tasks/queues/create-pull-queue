DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) The flags available to this command represent the fields of a pull
    queue that are mutable.

    If you have early access to Cloud Tasks, refer to the following guide for

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     PULL_QUEUE_ID
        ID of the pull queue to create.

FLAGS
     --max-attempts=MAX_ATTEMPTS
        The maximum number of attempts per task in the queue.

     --max-retry-duration=MAX_RETRY_DURATION
        The time limit for retrying a failed task, measured from when the task
        was first run. Once the --max-retry-duration time has passed and the
        task has been attempted --max-attempts times, no further attempts will
        be made and the task will be deleted.

        Must be a string that ends in 's', such as "5s".

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. Usually,
    users of ALPHA commands and flags need to apply for access, agree to
    applicable terms, and have their projects whitelisted. Contact Google or
    sign up on a product's page for ALPHA access. Product pages can be found at
