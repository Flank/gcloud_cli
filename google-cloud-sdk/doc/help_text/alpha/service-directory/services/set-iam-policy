        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Set IAM policy for a service.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Service resource - The Service Directory service to add IAM policy binding
     to. The arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of
     this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this
     group but can be set in other ways. To set the [project] attribute:
     provide the argument [service] on the command line with a fully specified
     name; set the property [core/project]. This must be specified.

       SERVICE
          ID of the service or fully qualified identifier for the service. This
          positional must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
          group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The name of the region for the service.

       --namespace=NAMESPACE
          The name of the namespace for the service.

     POLICY_FILE
        Path to a local JSON or YAML formatted file containing a valid policy.

        The output of the get-iam-policy command is a valid file, as is any
        JSON or YAML file conforming to the structure of a Policy
        (https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/Policy).

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,

    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,

        $ gcloud alpha service-directory services set-iam-policy \
            my-service --namespace=my-namespace --location=us-east1 \
            policy.json

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right

    access allowlist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta service-directory services set-iam-policy
