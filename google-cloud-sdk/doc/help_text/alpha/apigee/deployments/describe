NAME
    gcloud alpha apigee deployments describe - describe an Apigee API proxy
        deployment

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha apigee deployments describe
        [[REVISION]
          --api=API --environment=ENVIRONMENT --organization=ORGANIZATION]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Describe an Apigee API proxy deployment.

    gcloud alpha apigee deployments describe retrieves the status of a specific
    Apigee API proxy's deployment to a specific environment.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Revision resource - The API proxy revision and environment of the
     deployment to be described. REVISION defaults to auto, which will describe
     whichever revision is currently deployed. However, if more than one
     revision of API is deployed in ENVIRONMENT, then an explicit REVISION is
     required or the command will fail. The arguments in this group can be used
     to specify the attributes of this resource.

       [REVISION]
          ID of the revision or fully qualified identifier for the revision.

       --api=API
          The deployed API proxy.

       --environment=ENVIRONMENT
          The environment in which the proxy was deployed.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION
          The organization of the proxy and environment.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To get the status of a deployment in the active Cloud Platform project,
    which deploys my-proxy into the prod environment, run:

        gcloud alpha apigee deployments describe --api=my-proxy --environment=prod

    To get the status of a deployment in an Apigee organization called my-org,
    which deploys version 3 of the proxy my-proxy into the test environment,
    run:

        gcloud alpha apigee deployments describe 3 --organization=my-org --environment=test --api=my-proxy

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access whitelist.
