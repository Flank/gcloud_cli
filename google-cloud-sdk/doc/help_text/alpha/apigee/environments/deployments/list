SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha apigee environments deployments list
        (ENVIRONMENT : --organization=ORGANIZATION) [--filter=EXPRESSION]
        [--limit=LIMIT] [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE] [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]] [--uri]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) List the Apigee deployments in a given environment.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Environment resource - The Apigee environment whose deployments should be
     listed. The arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes
     of this resource. This must be specified.

       ENVIRONMENT
          ID of the environment or fully qualified identifier for the
          environment. This positional must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION
          The organization for the environment.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --uri
        Print a list of resource URIs instead of the default output.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To list all Apigee deployments for an environment called staging from the
    active Cloud Platform project, run:

        $ gcloud alpha apigee environments deployments list staging

    To list all Apigee deployments for an environment called test in an Apigee
    organization called my-org, run:

        $ gcloud alpha apigee environments deployments list test \
          --organization=my-org

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access whitelist.
