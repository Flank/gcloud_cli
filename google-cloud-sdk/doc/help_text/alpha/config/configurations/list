SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha config configurations list [--filter=EXPRESSION]
        [--limit=LIMIT] [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Lists existing named configurations.

    Run $ gcloud topic configurations for an overview of named configurations.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        The maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        A comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.
