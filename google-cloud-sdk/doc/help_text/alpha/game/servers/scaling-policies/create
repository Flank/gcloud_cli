DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Create a Cloud Game Server Scaling Policy.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Scaling policy resource - Cloud Game Server Scaling Policy to create. The
     arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways. To set the [project] attribute: provide the
     argument [scaling_policy] on the command line with a fully specified name;
     set the property [core/project]; provide the argument [--project] on the
     command line. This must be specified.

       SCALING_POLICY
          ID of the scaling policy or fully qualified identifier for the
          scaling policy. This positional must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          Google Cloud location.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --priority=PRIORITY
        Priority of the Scaling Policy.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --deployment=DEPLOYMENT
        Deployment for this Scaling Policy. Example:
        "projects/my-project/locations/global/gameServerDeployments/my-deployment".

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     --match-clusters=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        Labels to select clusters to which this Scaling Policy applies. This
        flag can be repeated.

        Example: $ gcloud alpha game servers scaling-policies create
        example-policy \ --match-clusters=label_a=value1,label_b=value2 \
        --match-clusters=label_c=value3,label_d=value4

        With the above command, this policy is applicable to clusters that have
        either label_a=value1 and label_b=value2, or
        label_c=value3,label_d=value4.

     --max-replicas=MAX_REPLICAS
        Maximum fleet size.

     --min-replicas=MIN_REPLICAS
        Minimum fleet size.

     --schedule=SCHEDULE
        Event schedules. Schedules allow Scaling policies to be adjusted for
        planned events. For example, you can add policies to scale specific
        clusters during an event. This flag can be repeated.

        The following keys are allowed:

         cron-spec
            Cron definition of the scheduled event. See
            https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron. The cron spec specification is
            in the local time as defined by the realm. Requires
            cron-job-duration to be specified.

         cron-job-duration
            Duration for the cron job event. The duration of the event is
            effective after the cron job's start time. See $ gcloud topic
            datetimes for information on duration formats. Required if
            cron-spec is specified.

         start-time
            Start time of the event. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for
            information on duration formats. Either start-time or cron-spec
            should be specified.

         end-time
            End time of the event. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information
            on duration formats.

            Example:

                $ gcloud alpha game servers scaling-policies create example-policy \
                    --schedule=start-time=2019-01-01T00:00:01Z,\
                end-time=2030-01-01T00:00:01Z,cron-job-duration=3600s,cron-spec="10\
                 0 1-7 5 *" --schedule=start-time=2050-01-01T00:00:01Z

     Size of the buffer of ready game server instances in either absolute
     number or percentage. As game server instances get allocated or
     terminated, the fleet will be scaled up and down so that this buffer is
     maintained. At most one of these may be specified:

       --buffer-size=BUFFER_SIZE
          Size of a buffer of ready game server instances in absolute number.

       --buffer-size-percent=BUFFER_SIZE_PERCENT
          Size of a buffer of ready game server instances in percentage.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.
