NAME
    gcloud alpha game servers deployments set-rollout-target - set rollout
        target for the ongoing Deployment rollout in the specified clusters

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha game servers deployments set-rollout-target
        (DEPLOYMENT : --location=LOCATION) --selector=SELECTOR [--async]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Set rollout target for the ongoing Deployment rollout in the
    specified clusters.

    A Deployment rollout updates game servers with a new image. The new image
    is specified through the spec field of game server template. It is a string
    field and follows the format of the spec field in Agones GameServer custom
    resource. Please see https://agones.dev for more details.

    The new game server template can be specified either through creating a new
    Deployment resource or through the start-rollout verb on an existing
    Deployment resource (gcloud game servers deployments start-rollout).

    Once the new game server template is specified, you can start the rollout
    by changing the percentage of game servers that run the new image through
    the set-rollout-target verb (gcloud game servers deployments
    set-rollout-target). The set-rollout-target verb specifies labels for
    clusters that should get the new image. It also specifies what percentage
    of game servers in each of the specified clusters should run the new image.

    Finally, you can finish the rollout using the commit verb (gcloud game
    servers deployments commit). This will set the rollout percentage to 100 in
    all clusters whose labels were previously specified by calling the
    set-rollout-target verb.

    If you need to revert a rollout, you can use the revert-rollout verb
    (gcloud game servers deployments revert-rollout) which deletes game servers
    running the new image.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Deployment resource - Cloud Game Server Deployment to set rollout target
     for. The arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of
     this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this
     group but can be set in other ways. To set the [project] attribute:
     provide the argument [deployment] on the command line with a fully
     specified name; set the property [core/project]; provide the argument
     [--project] on the command line. This must be specified.

       DEPLOYMENT
          ID of the deployment or fully qualified identifier for the
          deployment. This positional must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          Google Cloud location.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --selector=SELECTOR
        Map representing the percentage of game servers running the new game
        server template in clusters selected by their labels. This flag can be
        repeated.

         cluster-labels
            Key value pairs of labels to use for selecting clusters that should
            run the new game server template.

         percent
            Percentage of game servers running the new game server template in
            the selected clusters. The percentage is applied to game server
            clusters which match any of the specified labels. The specified
            percentage cannot be lower than its current value. Default is 100.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the gameservices/v1alpha API. The full documentation for
    this API can be found at: https://cloud.google.com/solutions/gaming/

EXAMPLES
    To set a rollout target with one selector for one cluster label key/value
    pair:

        $ gcloud alpha game servers deployments set-rollout-target \
            example-deployment \
            --selector=cluster-labels=label_a=value1,percent=10

    To set a rollout target with multiple selectors, repeat the --selector
    flag:

        $ gcloud alpha game servers deployments set-rollout-target \
            example-deployment \
            --selector=cluster-labels=label_a=value1,percent=10 \
            --selector=cluster-labels=label_b=value2,percent=20

    To set a rollout target for with one selector multiple cluster label
    key/value pairs, you can use this syntax:

        $ gcloud alpha game servers deployments set-rollout-target \
            example-deployment \
            --selector=cluster-labels=^:^"label_a=value1:label_b=value2",\
        percent=20

    Alternatively, you can specify the labels in a YAML file using the
    --flags-file flag:

        $ gcloud alpha game servers deployments set-rollout-target \
            example-deployment --flags-file="flags.yaml"

    Contents of flags.yaml:

        - --selector:
            cluster-labels:
                label_a: value1
                label_b: value2
            percent: 10
        - --selector:
            cluster-labels:
                label_c: value3
                label_d: value4
            percent: 20

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access whitelist.
