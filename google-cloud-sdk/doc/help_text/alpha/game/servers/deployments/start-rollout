NAME
    gcloud alpha game servers deployments start-rollout - start Deployment
        rollout by providing a new game server template

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha game servers deployments start-rollout
        (DEPLOYMENT : --location=LOCATION) [--async]
        [--description=DESCRIPTION
          --spec-file=SPEC_FILE --template-id=TEMPLATE_ID]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Start Deployment rollout by providing a new game server template.
    The game server template should include the game server spec that will be
    sent to Agones during rollout.

    A Deployment rollout updates game servers with a new image. The new image
    is specified through the spec-file field of game server template. It is a
    path to a JSON or YAML file that contains game server spec that follows the
    format of the spec field in Agones GameServer custom resource. Please see
    https://agones.dev/site/docs/reference/gameserver/ for more details.

    The new game server template can be specified either through creating a new
    Deployment resource or through the start-rollout verb on an existing
    Deployment resource (gcloud game servers deployments start-rollout).

    Once the new game server template is specified, you can start the rollout
    by changing the percentage of game servers that run the new image through
    the set-rollout-target verb (gcloud game servers deployments
    set-rollout-target). The set-rollout-target verb specifies labels for
    clusters that should get the new image. It also specifies what percentage
    of game servers in each of the specified clusters should run the new image.

    Finally, you can finish the rollout using the commit verb (gcloud game
    servers deployments commit). This will set the rollout percentage to 100 in
    all clusters whose labels were previously specified by calling the
    set-rollout-target verb.

    If you need to revert a rollout, you can use the revert-rollout verb
    (gcloud game servers deployments revert-rollout) which deletes game servers
    running the new image.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Deployment resource - Cloud Game Server Deployment resource to start
     rollout for. The arguments in this group can be used to specify the
     attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the [project]
     attribute: provide the argument [deployment] on the command line with a
     fully specified name; set the property [core/project]; provide the
     argument [--project] on the command line. This must be specified.

       DEPLOYMENT
          ID of the deployment or fully qualified identifier for the
          deployment. This positional must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          Google Cloud location.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     Game server template for a new rollout. In order to start a new rollout,
     you should first add a game server template that includes the game server
     spec that will be sent to Agones during rollout. The spec file is a path
     to a JSON or YAML file that contains game server spec. The game server
     spec follows the format of the spec field in Agones GameServer custom
     resource. Please see https://agones.dev/site/docs/reference/gameserver/
     for more details.

       --description=DESCRIPTION
          Description of the game server template.

       --spec-file=SPEC_FILE
          Path to a JSON or YAML file that contains game server spec which is
          sent to Agones. The game server spec follows the format of the spec
          field in Agones GameServer custom resource. Please see
          https://github.com/googleforgames/agones/blob/master/examples/simple-udp/gameserver.yaml
          for example and
          https://github.com/googleforgames/agones/blob/master/pkg/apis/agones/v1/gameserver.go
          for GameServerTemplateSpec definition. Required when template-id is
          specified. This flag must be specified if any of the other arguments
          in this group are specified.

       --template-id=TEMPLATE_ID
          ID of the game server template. Required when spec-file is specified.
          This flag must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
          group are specified.
