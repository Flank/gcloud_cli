        (ALLOCATION_POLICY : --location=LOCATION) [--async]
        [--clear-match-clusters] [--match-clusters=[KEY=VALUE,...]]
        [--priority=PRIORITY] [--schedule=SCHEDULE]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Update a Cloud Game Server Allocation Policy.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Allocation policy resource - Cloud Game Server Allocation Policy to
     update. The arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes
     of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this
     group but can be set in other ways. To set the [project] attribute:
     provide the argument [allocation_policy] on the command line with a fully
     specified name; set the property [core/project]; provide the argument
     [--project] on the command line. This must be specified.

       ALLOCATION_POLICY
          ID of the allocation policy or fully qualified identifier for the
          allocation policy. This positional must be specified if any of the
          other arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          Google Cloud location.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --clear-match-clusters
        Remove all labels that select clusters. If --match-clusters is also
        specified then --clear-match-cluster is applied first.

        Example: $ gcloud alpha game servers allocation-policies update \
        example-policy --clear-match-clusters

     --match-clusters=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        Labels to select clusters to which this Allocation Policy applies. This
        flag can be repeated. Specifying --match-clusters during update will
        fully replace existing cluster selection.

        Example: $ gcloud alpha game servers allocation-policies update \
        example-policy --match-clusters=label_a=value1,label_b=value2 \
        --match-clusters=label_c=value3,label_d=value4

        With the above command, this policy is applicable to clusters that have
        either label_a=value1 and label_b=value2, or
        label_c=value3,label_d=value4.

     --priority=PRIORITY
        Priority of the Allocation Policy.

     --schedule=SCHEDULE
        Event schedules. Schedules allow allocation policies to be adjusted for
        planned events. For example, you can add policies to allocate from
        specific clusters during an event. This flag can be repeated.

        The following keys are allowed:

         cron-spec
            Cron definition of the scheduled event. See
            https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron. The cron spec specification is
            in the local time as defined by the realm. Requires
            cron-job-duration to be specified.

         cron-job-duration
            Duration for the cron job event. The duration of the event is
            effective after the cron job's start time. See $ gcloud topic
            datetimes for information on duration formats. Required if
            cron-spec is specified.

         start-time
            Start time of the event. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for
            information on duration formats. Either start-time or cron-spec
            should be specified.

         end-time
            End time of the event. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information
            on duration formats.

            Example:

                $ gcloud alpha game servers allocation-policies update \
                    example-policy \
                    --schedule=start-time=2019-01-01T00:00:01Z,\
                end-time=2030-01-01T00:00:01Z,cron-job-duration=3600s,cron-spec="10\
                 0 1-7 5 *" --schedule=start-time=2050-01-01T00:00:01Z

     --update-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to update. If a label exists its value is
        modified, otherwise a new label is created.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     --weight=WEIGHT
        Relative weight of the Allocation Policy.

        If there are multiple policies with the same priority, a policy will be
        selected at random, where the probability of a given policy being
        selected is based on its weight. For example, if there are two policies
        with priority 1, where policy A has weight 100 and policy B has weight
        300, policy A will be selected 25% of the time, and policy B will be
        selected 75% of the time.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --clear-labels
          Remove all labels. If --update-labels is also specified then
          --clear-labels is applied first.

          For example, to remove all labels:

              $ gcloud alpha game servers allocation-policies update --clear-labels

          To set the labels to exactly "foo" and "baz":

              $ gcloud alpha game servers allocation-policies update \
                --clear-labels --update-labels foo=bar,baz=qux

       --remove-labels=[KEY,...]
          List of label keys to remove. If a label does not exist it is
          silently ignored.
