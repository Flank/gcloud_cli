NAME
    gcloud alpha bigtable instances remove-iam-policy-binding - remove an IAM
        policy binding from a Cloud Bigtable instance

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha bigtable instances remove-iam-policy-binding INSTANCE
        --member=MEMBER --role=ROLE
        [--all | --condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          | --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Remove an IAM policy binding from a Cloud Bigtable instance. One
    binding consists of a member, a role, and an optional condition.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Instance resource - The Cloud Bigtable instance to remove the IAM policy
     binding from. This represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are
     not given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the
     [project] attribute: provide the argument [instance] on the command line
     with a fully specified name; provide the argument [--project] on the
     command line; set the property [core/project]. This must be specified.

       INSTANCE
          ID of the instance or fully qualified identifier for the instance.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --member=MEMBER
        The member to remove the binding for. Should be of the form
        user|group|serviceAccount:email or domain:domain.

        Examples: user:test-user@gmail.com, group:admins@example.com,
        serviceAccount:test123@example.domain.com, or
        domain:example.domain.com.

        Can also be one of the following special values:
        * allUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone who is on the
          internet, with or without a Google account.
        * allAuthenticatedUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone
          who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account.

     --role=ROLE
        The role to remove the member from.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     At most one of these may be specified:

       --all
          Remove all bindings with this role and member, irrespective of any
          conditions.

       --condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          The condition of the binding to be removed. When the condition is
          explicitly specified as None (--condition=None), it matches a binding
          without a condition. Otherwise, only the binding with a condition
          which exactly matches the specified condition (including the optional
          description) will be removed.

       expression
          (Required) Expression of the condition which evaluates to True or
          False. This uses a subset of Common Expression Language syntax.

       title
          (Required) A short string describing the purpose of the expression.

       description
          (Optional) Additional description for the expression.

          NOTE: An unsatisfied condition will not allow access via this
          binding.

       --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE
          Path to a local JSON or YAML file that defines the condition. To see
          available fields, see the help for --condition.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
