DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Set the IAM policy for a Cloud Bigtable instance.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Instance resource - The instance to set the IAM policy for. This
     represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the [project]
     attribute: provide the argument [instance] on the command line with a
     fully specified name; provide the argument [--project] on the command
     line; set the property [core/project]. This must be specified.

       INSTANCE
          ID of the instance or fully qualified identifier for the instance.

     POLICY_FILE
        Path to a local JSON or YAML formatted file containing a valid policy.

        The output of the get-iam-policy command is a valid file, as is any
        JSON or YAML file conforming to the structure of a Policy
        (https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/Policy).

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    The following command will read an IAM policy defined in a JSON file        'policy.json' and set it for an instance with identifier 'my-instance-id'

        $ gcloud alpha bigtable instances set-iam-policy my-instance-id \
        policy.json

        See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details
        of the policy file format and contents.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud bigtable instances set-iam-policy
        $ gcloud beta bigtable instances set-iam-policy
