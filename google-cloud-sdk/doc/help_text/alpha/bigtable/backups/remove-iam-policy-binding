        (BACKUP : --cluster=CLUSTER --instance=INSTANCE) --member=MEMBER
        --role=ROLE

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Remove an IAM policy binding from a Cloud Bigtable Backup. One
    binding consists of a member, a role, and an optional condition.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Backup resource - Cloud Bigtable Backup to remove the IAM policy binding
     from. The arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of
     this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this
     group but can be set in other ways. To set the [project] attribute:
     provide the argument [backup] on the command line with a fully specified
     name; provide the argument [--project] on the command line; set the
     property [core/project]. This must be specified.

       BACKUP
          ID of the backup or fully qualified identifier for the backup. This
          positional must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
          group are specified.

       --cluster=CLUSTER
          The name of the Cloud Bigtable cluster.

       --instance=INSTANCE
          The name of the Cloud Bigtable instance.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --member=MEMBER
        The member to remove the binding for. Should be of the form
        user|group|serviceAccount:email or domain:domain.

        Examples: user:test-user@gmail.com, group:admins@example.com,
        serviceAccount:test123@example.domain.com, or
        domain:example.domain.com.

        Can also be one of the following special values:
        * allUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone who is on the
          internet, with or without a Google account.
        * allAuthenticatedUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone
          who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account.

     --role=ROLE
        The role to remove the member from.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     At most one of these may be specified:

       --all
          Remove all bindings with this role and member, irrespective of any
          conditions.

       --condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          The condition of the binding to be removed. When the condition is
          explicitly specified as None (--condition=None), it matches a binding
          without a condition. Otherwise, only the binding with a condition
          which exactly matches the specified condition (including the optional
          description) will be removed.

       expression
          (Required) Expression of the condition which evaluates to True or
          False. This uses a subset of Common Expression Language syntax.

       title
          (Required) A short string describing the purpose of the expression.

       description
          (Optional) Additional description for the expression.

          NOTE: An unsatisfied condition will not allow access via this
          binding.

       --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE
          Path to a local JSON or YAML file that defines the condition. To see
          available fields, see the help for --condition.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
