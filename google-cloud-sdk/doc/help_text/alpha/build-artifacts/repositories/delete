        Artifacts repository

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha build-artifacts repositories delete REPOSITORY [--async]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Delete a Cloud Build Artifacts repository. Before you delete a
    repository, ensure that any active dependencies on this repository are
    adjusted to use a new location.

    This command can fail for the following reasons:
      o The specified repository does not exist.
      o The active account does not have permission to delete repositories.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Repository resource - The Cloud Build Artifacts repository to delete. This
     represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the [project]
     attribute: provide the argument [repository] on the command line with a
     fully specified name; provide the argument [--project] on the command
     line; set the property [core/project]. This must be specified.

          ID of the repository or fully qualified identifier for the
          repository.

FLAGS
