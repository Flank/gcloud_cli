DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Alpha versions of gcloud commands.

GLOBAL FLAGS
     --account=ACCOUNT
        Google Cloud Platform user account to use for invocation. Overrides the
        default core/account property value for this command invocation.

     --billing-project=BILLING_PROJECT
        The Google Cloud Platform project that will be charged quota for
        operations performed in gcloud. If you need to operate on one project,
        but need quota against a different project, you can use this flag to
        specify the billing project. If both billing/quota_project and
        --billing-project are specified, --billing-project takes precedence.
        Run $ gcloud config set --help to see more information about
        billing/quota_project.

     --configuration=CONFIGURATION
        The configuration to use for this command invocation. For more
        information on how to use configurations, run: gcloud topic
        configurations. You can also use the CLOUDSDK_ACTIVE_CONFIG_NAME
        environment variable to set the equivalent of this flag for a terminal
        session.

     --flags-file=YAML_FILE
        A YAML or JSON file that specifies a --flag:value dictionary. Useful
        for specifying complex flag values with special characters that work
        with any command interpreter. Additionally, each --flags-file arg is
        replaced by its constituent flags. See $ gcloud topic flags-file for
        more information.

     --flatten=[KEY,...]
        Flatten name[] output resource slices in KEY into separate records for
        each item in each slice. Multiple keys and slices may be specified.
        This also flattens keys for --format and --filter. For example,
        --flatten=abc.def flattens abc.def[].ghi references to abc.def.ghi. A
        resource record containing abc.def[] with N elements will expand to N
        records in the flattened output. This flag interacts with other flags
        that are applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter,
        --limit.

     --format=FORMAT
        Set the format for printing command output resources. The default is a
        command-specific human-friendly output format. The supported formats
        are: config, csv, default, diff, disable, flattened, get, json, list,
        multi, none, object, table, text, value, yaml. For more details run $
        gcloud topic formats.

     --help
        Display detailed help.

     --project=PROJECT_ID
        The Google Cloud Platform project ID to use for this invocation. If
        omitted, then the current project is assumed; the current project can
        be listed using gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)' and
        can be set using gcloud config set project PROJECTID.

        --project and its fallback core/project property play two roles in the
        invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate on. It
        also specifies the project for API enablement check, quota, and
        billing. To specify a different project for quota and billing, use
        --billing-project or billing/quota_project property.

     --quiet, -q
        Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
        is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.
        Overrides the default core/disable_prompts property value for this
        command invocation. This is equivalent to setting the environment
        variable CLOUDSDK_CORE_DISABLE_PROMPTS to 1.

     --verbosity=VERBOSITY; default="warning"
        Override the default verbosity for this command. Overrides the default
        core/verbosity property value for this command invocation. VERBOSITY
        must be one of: debug, info, warning, error, critical, none.

     --version, -v
        Print version information and exit. This flag is only available at the
        global level.

     -h
        Print a summary help and exit.

OTHER FLAGS
     --impersonate-service-account=SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL
        For this gcloud invocation, all API requests will be made as the given
        service account instead of the currently selected account. This is done
        without needing to create, download, and activate a key for the
        account. In order to perform operations as the service account, your
        currently selected account must have an IAM role that includes the
        iam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken permission for the service account.
        The roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator role has this permission or
        you may create a custom role. Overrides the default
        auth/impersonate_service_account property value for this command
        invocation.

     --log-http
        Log all HTTP server requests and responses to stderr. Overrides the
        default core/log_http property value for this command invocation.

     --trace-token=TRACE_TOKEN
        Token used to route traces of service requests for investigation of
        issues. Overrides the default core/trace_token property value for this
        command invocation.

     --user-output-enabled
        Print user intended output to the console. Overrides the default
        core/user_output_enabled property value for this command invocation.
        Use --no-user-output-enabled to disable.
