DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) List a finding's security marks.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Finding resource - The finding to be used for the SCC command. The
     arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. This must be specified.

       FINDING
          ID of the finding or fully qualified identifier for the finding. This
          positional must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
          group are specified.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION
          (Optional) If the full resource name isn't provided e.g.
          organizations/123, then provide the organization id which is the
          suffix of the organization. Example: organizations/123, the id is
          123.

       --source=SOURCE
          (Optional) If the full resource name isn't provided e.g.
          organizations/123/sources/456, then provide the source id which is
          the suffix of the source. Example: organizations/123/sources/456, the
          id is 456.

FLAGS
     --page-token=PAGE_TOKEN
        Response objects will return a non-null value for page-token to
        indicate that there is at least one additional page of data. User can
        either directly request that page by specifying the page-token
        explicitly or let gcloud fetch one-page-at-a-time.

     --read-time=READ_TIME
        Time used as a reference point when filtering. Absence of this field
        will default to the API's version of NOW. For example --read-time
        "2019-02-28T07:00:00Z"

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

EXAMPLES
    List all security marks for my-finding under organization 123456 and source
    5678:

        $ gcloud alpha scc findings list-marks my-finding \
            --organization=123456 --source 5678

    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you will have to apply for early access and have your projects
    registered on the API whitelist to use it. To do so, contact Support at
