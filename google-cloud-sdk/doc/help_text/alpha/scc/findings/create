POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Finding resource - The finding you want to create. The arguments in this
     group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. This must be
     specified.

       FINDING
          ID of the finding or fully qualified identifier for the finding. This
          positional must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
          group are specified.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION
          (Optional) If the full resource name isn't provided e.g.
          organizations/123, then provide the organization id which is the
          suffix of the organization. Example: organizations/123, the id is
          123.

       --source=SOURCE
          (Optional) If the full resource name isn't provided e.g.
          organizations/123/sources/456, then provide the source id which is
          the suffix of the source. Example: organizations/123/sources/456, the
          id is 456.

FLAGS
     --category=CATEGORY
        Taxonomy group within findings from a given source. Example:
        XSS_FLASH_INJECTION

     --event-time=EVENT_TIME
        Time at which the event took place. For example, if the finding
        represents an open firewall it would capture the time the open firewall
        was detected. If event-time is not provided, it will default to UTC
        version of NOW. For example 2019-02-28T07:00:00Z

     --external-uri=EXTERNAL_URI
        URI that, if available, points to a web page outside of Cloud SCC
        (Security Command Center) where additional information about the
        finding can be found. This field is guaranteed to be either empty or a
        well formed URL.

     --resource-name=RESOURCE_NAME
        Full resource name of the Google Cloud Platform resource this finding
        is for.

     --source-properties=[SOURCE_PROPERTIES,...]
        Source specific properties. These properties are managed by the source
        that writes the finding. The key names in the source_properties map
        must be between 1 and 255 characters, and must start with a letter and
        contain alphanumeric characters or underscores only. For example
        "key1=val1,key2=val2"

EXAMPLES
    Create an ACTIVE my-finding attached to example-project under organization
    123456 and source 5678:

        $ gcloud alpha scc findings create my-finding \
            --organization=123456 --source=5678 --state ACTIVE \
            --resource-name \
            '//cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/v1/projects/example-proje\
        ct'

    Create an ACTIVE my-finding with category: XSS_SCRIPTING under organization
    123456 and source 5678:

        $ gcloud alpha scc findings create my-finding \
            --organization=123456 --source=5678 --state ACTIVE \
