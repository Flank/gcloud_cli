SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha scc findings update
        (FINDING : --organization=ORGANIZATION --source=SOURCE)
        [--event-time=EVENT_TIME] [--external-uri=EXTERNAL_URI]
        [--source-properties=[SOURCE_PROPERTIES,...]] [--state=STATE]
        [--update-mask=UPDATE_MASK] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Update a Cloud Security Command Center finding.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Finding resource - The finding you want to update. The arguments in this
     group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. This must be
     specified.

       FINDING
          ID of the finding or fully qualified identifier for the finding. This
          positional must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
          group are specified.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION
          (Optional) If the full resource name isn't provided e.g.
          organizations/123, then provide the organization id which is the
          suffix of the organization. Example: organizations/123, the id is
          123.

       --source=SOURCE
          (Optional) If the full resource name isn't provided e.g.
          organizations/123/sources/456, then provide the source id which is
          the suffix of the source. Example: organizations/123/sources/456, the
          id is 456.

FLAGS
     --event-time=EVENT_TIME
        Time at which the event took place. For example, if the finding
        represents an open firewall it would capture the time the open firewall
        was detected. If event-time is not provided, it will default to UTC
        version of NOW. For example 2019-02-28T07:00:00Z

     --external-uri=EXTERNAL_URI
        URI that, if available, points to a web page outside of Cloud SCC
        (Security Command Center) where additional information about the
        finding can be found. This field is guaranteed to be either empty or a
        well formed URL.

     --source-properties=[SOURCE_PROPERTIES,...]
        Source specific properties. These properties are managed by the source
        that writes the finding. The key names in the source_properties map
        must be between 1 and 255 characters, and must start with a letter and
        contain alphanumeric characters or underscores only. For example
        "key1=val1,key2=val2"

     --state=STATE
        State is one of: [ACTIVE, INACTIVE]. STATE must be one of: active,
        inactive, state-unspecified.

     --update-mask=UPDATE_MASK
        Optional: If left unspecified (default), an update-mask is
        automatically created using the flags specified in the command and only
        those values are updated. For example: --external-uri='<some-uri>'
        --event-time='<some-time>' would automatically generate --update-mask
        'external_uri,event_time'. Note that as a result, only external-uri and
        event-time are updated for the given finding and everything else
        remains untouched. If you want to delete attributes/properties (that
        are not being changed in the update command) use an empty update-mask
        (''). That will delete all the mutable properties/attributes that
        aren't specified as flags in the update command. In the above example
        it would delete source-properties. State can be toggled from ACTIVE to
        INACTIVE and vice-versa but it cannot be deleted.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the securitycenter/v1 API. The full documentation for
    this API can be found at:
    https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/securitycenter.googleapis.com/overview

EXAMPLES
    Update my-finding's state from ACTIVE to INACTIVE:

        $ gcloud alpha scc findings update my-finding \
            --organization=123456 --source=5678 --state INACTIVE

    Override all source properties on my-finding:

        $ gcloud alpha scc findings update my-finding \
            --organization=123456 --source=5678 \
            --source-properties "propKey1=propVal1,propKey2=propVal2"

    Selectively update a specific source property on my-finding:

        $ gcloud alpha scc findings update my-finding \
            --organization=123456 --source=5678 \
            --source-properties "propKey1=propVal1,propKey2=propVal2" \
            --update-mask "source_properties.propKey1"

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud scc findings update
        $ gcloud beta scc findings update
