DESCRIPTION

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Organization resource - The organization to be used for the SCC (Security

          organization.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --asset=ASSET
          Cloud SCC specific asset. It's derived from the the asset's relative
          resource name. See:
          https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names#relative_resource_name.
          For Example, for the given asset name:
          "organizations/123/assets/456", 456 represents asset id.

       --resource-name=RESOURCE_NAME
          Asset's resource name. Full resource name of the Google Cloud
          Platform resource this asset represents. This field is immutable
          after create time. See:
          https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names#full_resource_name.
          For Example:
          "//cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/1234567890123" could
          be the resource-name for a project.
