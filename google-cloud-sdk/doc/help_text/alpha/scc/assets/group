NAME
    gcloud alpha scc assets group - filter an organization's assets and groups
        them by their specified properties

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha scc assets group [ORGANIZATION]
        [--compare-duration=COMPARE_DURATION] [--filter=FILTER]
        [--group-by=GROUP_BY] [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE] [--page-token=PAGE_TOKEN]
        [--read-time=READ_TIME] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Filter an organization's assets and groups them by their specified
    properties.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Organization resource - Refers to the source whose assets should be
     grouped by. This represents a Cloud resource.

       [ORGANIZATION]
          ID of the organization or fully qualified identifier for the
          organization.

FLAGS
     --compare-duration=COMPARE_DURATION
        GroupAssetsResult's "state_change" attribute is updated to indicate
        whether the asset was added, removed, or remained present during the
        compare_duration period of time that precedes the read_time. Example
        duration: "100000s"

     --filter=FILTER
        Expression is a list of one or more restrictions combined via logical
        operators 'AND' and 'OR'. Parentheses are not supported, and 'OR' has
        higher precedence than 'AND'. For example, 'update_time > 100 AND
        security_center_properties.resource_type=\"google.cloud.resourcemanager.Organization\"'
        is a valid filter string.

     --group-by=GROUP_BY
        Expression that defines what asset fields to use for grouping
        (including 'state'). String value should follow SQL syntax: comma
        separated list of fields. For example: "parent,resource_name". The
        following fields are supported:
        * security_center_properties.resource_project
        * security_center_properties.resource_type
        * security_center_properties.resource_parent
        * state_change

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        The maximum number of results to return in a single response. Default
        is 10, minimum is 1, maximum is 1000.

     --page-token=PAGE_TOKEN
        Value returned by the last 'GroupAssetsResponse'; indicates that this
        is a continuation of a prior 'GroupAssets' call, and that the system
        should return the next page of data.

     --read-time=READ_TIME
        Time used as a reference point when filtering assets. Filter is limited
        to assets existing at the supplied time and their values are those at
        that specific time. For example: 2019-02-28T07:00:00Z. Absence of this
        field will default to the API's version of NOW.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the securitycenter/v1 API. The full documentation for
    this API can be found at:
    https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/securitycenter.googleapis.com/overview

EXAMPLES
    Group assets under organization 123456 by their type (e.g. project, disk,
    compute instance, service etc):

        $ gcloud alpha scc assets group 123456 \
            --group-by "security_center_properties.resource_type"

    Group compute instances (assets) under organization 123456 by their
    respective projects:

        $ gcloud alpha scc assets group 123456 \
            --filter \
            "security_center_properties.resource_type=\"google.compute.Insta\
        nce\"" --group-by "security_center_properties.resource_project"

    Group assets that were updated on or after 2019-01-01T01:00:00 GMT by their
    types.

        $ gcloud alpha scc assets group 123456 \
            --filter "update_time >= 1546304400000" \
            --group-by "security_center_properties.resource_type"

    Group assets into following 3 state_changes (ADDED/DELETED/ACTIVE) based on
    the activity during past 24 hours:

        $ gcloud alpha scc assets group 123456 --compare-duration 86400s \
            --group-by "state_change"

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access whitelist.
