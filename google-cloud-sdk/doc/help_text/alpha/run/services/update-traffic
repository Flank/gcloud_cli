SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha run services update-traffic [[SERVICE] --namespace=NAMESPACE]
        [--async] [--platform=PLATFORM]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Adjust the trafic assignments for a Cloud Run service.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Service resource - Service to update the configuration of. The arguments
     in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource.

       [SERVICE]
          ID of the service or fully qualified identifier for the service.

       --namespace=NAMESPACE
          Specific to Cloud Run on GKE: Kubernetes namespace for the service.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --platform=PLATFORM
        Target platform for running commands. Alternatively, set the property
        [run/platform]. If not specified, the user will be prompted to choose a
        platform. PLATFORM must be one of:

         managed
            Fully managed version of Cloud Run. Use with the --region flag or
            set the [run/region] property to specify a Cloud Run region.
         gke
            Cloud Run for Anthos on Google Kubernetes Engine. Use with the
            --cluster and --cluster-location flags or set the [run/cluster] and
            [run/cluster_location] properties to specify a cluster in a given
            zone.
         kubernetes
            Use a Knative-compatible kubernetes cluster. Use with the
            --kubeconfig and --context flags to specify a kubeconfig file and
            the context for connecting.

     Only applicable if connecting to Cloud Run for Anthos deployed on GKE.
     Specify '--platform=gke' to use:

       Cluster resource - Kubernetes Engine cluster to connect to. The
       arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
       resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group
       but can be set in other ways. To set the [project] attribute: provide
       the argument [--cluster] on the command line with a fully specified
       name; set the property [run/cluster] with a fully specified name;
       specify the cluster from a list of available clusters with a fully
       specified name; provide the argument [--project] on the command line;
       set the property [core/project].

         --cluster=CLUSTER
            ID of the cluster or fully qualified identifier for the cluster.

         --cluster-location=CLUSTER_LOCATION
            Zone in which the cluster is located. Alternatively, set the
            property [run/cluster_location].

       At most one of these may be specified:

         --to-latest
            True to assign 100 percent of traffic to the 'latest' revision of
            this service. Note that when a new revision is created, it will
            become the 'latest' and traffic will be directed to it. Defaults to
            False.

         --to-revisions=[REVISION-NAME=PERCENTAGE,...]
            Comma separated list of traffic assignments in the form
            REVISION-NAME=PERCENTAGE. REVISION-NAME must be the name for a
            revision for the service as returned by 'gcloud beta run list
            revisions'. PERCENTAGE must be an integer percentage between 0 and
            100 inclusive. Ex service-nw9hs=10,service-nw9hs=20 Up to 100
            percent of traffic may be assigned. If 100 percent of traffic is
            assigned, the Service traffic is updated as specified. If under 100
            percent of traffic is assigned, the Service traffic is updated as
            specified for revisions with assignments and traffic is scaled up
            or down down proportionally as needed for revision that are
            currently serving traffic but that do not have new assignments. For
            example assume revision-1 is serving 40 percent of traffic and
            revision-2 is serving 60 percent. If revision-1 is assigned 45
            percent of traffic and no assignment is made for revision-2, the
            service is updated with revsion-1 assigned 45 percent of traffic
            and revision-2 scaled down to 55 percent.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

EXAMPLES
    To assign 10% of traffic to revision myservice-s5sxn and 90% of traffic to
    revision myservice-cp9kw run:

        $ gcloud alpha run services update-traffic myservice \
          --to-revisions=myservice-s5sxn=10,myservice-cp9kw=90

    To increase the traffic to revision myservice-s5sxn to 20% and by reducing
    the traffic to revision myservice-cp9kw to 80% run:

        $ gcloud alpha run services update-traffic myservice \
          --to-revisions=myservice-s5sxn=20

    To rollback to revision myservice-cp9kw run:

        $ gcloud alpha run services update-traffic myservice \
          --to-revisions=myservice-cp9kw=100

    To assign 100% of traffic to the current or future LATEST revision run:

        $ gcloud alpha run services update-traffic myservice --to-latest

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
