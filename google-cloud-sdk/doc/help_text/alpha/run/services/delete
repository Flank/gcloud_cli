         but can be set in other ways. To set the [project] attribute: provide
         the argument [--cluster] on the command line with a fully specified
         name; set the property [run/cluster] with a fully specified name;
         specify the cluster from a list of available clusters with a fully
         specified name; provide the argument [--project] on the command line;
         set the property [core/project].

              Zone in which the cluster is located. Alternatively, set the
              property [run/cluster_location].

       Only applicable if connecting to Cloud Run for Anthos deployed on
       VMware. Specify --platform=kubernetes to use:

            The name of the context in your kubectl config file to use for
            connecting.

            The absolute path to your kubectl config file. If not specified,
            the colon- or semicolon-delimited list of paths specified by
            $KUBECONFIG will be used. If $KUBECONFIG is unset, this defaults to
            ~/.kube/config.
