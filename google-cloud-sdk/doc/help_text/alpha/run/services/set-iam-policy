NAME
    gcloud alpha run services set-iam-policy - set the IAM policy for a service

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha run services set-iam-policy (SERVICE : --region=REGION)
        POLICY_FILE [--platform=PLATFORM] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) This command replaces the existing IAM policy for a service, given
    a service and a file encoded in JSON or YAML that contains the IAM policy.
    If the given policy file specifies an "etag" value, then the replacement
    will succeed only if the policy already in place matches that etag. (An
    etag obtain via get-iam-policy will prevent the replacement if the policy
    for the service has been subsequently updated.) A policy file that does not
    contain an etag value will replace any existing policy for the service.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Service resource - The service for which to set the IAM policy. The
     arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways. To set the [project] attribute: provide the
     argument [service] on the command line with a fully specified name; set
     the property [core/project]; provide the argument [--project] on the
     command line. This must be specified.

       SERVICE
          ID of the service or fully qualified identifier for the service. This
          positional must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
          group are specified.

       --region=REGION
          The Cloud Run region.

     POLICY_FILE
        Path to a local JSON or YAML formatted file containing a valid policy.

        The output of the get-iam-policy command is a valid file, as is any
        JSON or YAML file conforming to the structure of a Policy
        (https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/Policy).

FLAGS
     --platform=PLATFORM
        Target platform for running commands. PLATFORM must be one of:

         gke
            Cloud Run on Google Kubernetes Engine. This platform is not
            supported by this command.

         kubernetes
            Use a Knative-compatible kubernetes cluster. This platform is not
            supported by this command.

         managed
            Fully managed version of Cloud Run. Use with the --region flag or
            set the [run/region] property to specify a Cloud Run region.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the run/v1alpha1 API. The full documentation for this API
    can be found at: https://cloud.google.com/run/

EXAMPLES
    The following command will read an IAM policy defined in a JSON file
    'policy.json' and set it for a service with identifier 'my-service'

        $ gcloud alpha run services set-iam-policy --region=us-central1 \
            my-service policy.json

    See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details of the
    policy file format and contents.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access whitelist. This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta run services set-iam-policy
