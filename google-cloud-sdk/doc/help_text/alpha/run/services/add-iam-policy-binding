        --role=ROLE [--platform=PLATFORM]
        [--condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          | --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE]

DESCRIPTION
    (ALPHA) Add an IAM policy binding to the IAM policy of a Cloud Run service.
    One binding consists of a member, a role, and an optional condition.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Service resource - The service for which to add IAM policy binding to.
     This represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the [project]
     attribute: provide the argument [service] on the command line with a fully
     specified name; set the property [core/project]; provide the argument
     [--project] on the command line. To set the [region] attribute: provide
     the argument [service] on the command line with a fully specified name;
     provide the argument [--region] on the command line; set the property
     [run/region]; specify from a list of available regions in a prompt. This
     must be specified.

       SERVICE
          ID of the service or fully qualified identifier for the service.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --member=MEMBER
        The member to add the binding for. Should be of the form
        user|group|serviceAccount:email or domain:domain.

        Examples: user:test-user@gmail.com, group:admins@example.com,
        serviceAccount:test123@example.domain.com, or
        domain:example.domain.com.

        Can also be one of the following special values:
        * allUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone who is on the
          internet, with or without a Google account.
        * allAuthenticatedUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone
          who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account.

     --role=ROLE
        Define the role of the member.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --platform=PLATFORM
        Target platform for running commands. Alternatively, set the property
        [run/platform]. If not specified, the user will be prompted to choose a
        platform. PLATFORM must be one of:

         managed
            Fully managed version of Cloud Run. Use with the --region flag or
            set the [run/region] property to specify a Cloud Run region.
         gke
            Cloud Run for Anthos on Google Cloud. Use with the --cluster and
            --cluster-location flags or set the [run/cluster] and
            [run/cluster_location] properties to specify a cluster in a given
            zone.
         kubernetes
            Use a Knative-compatible kubernetes cluster. Use with the
            --kubeconfig and --context flags to specify a kubeconfig file and
            the context for connecting.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          The condition of the binding to be added. When the condition is
          explicitly specified as None (--condition=None), a binding without a
          condition is added. When the condition is specified and is not None,
          --role cannot be a primitive role. Primitive roles are roles/editor,
          roles/owner, and roles/viewer.

       expression
          (Required) Expression of the condition which evaluates to True or
          False. This uses a subset of Common Expression Language syntax.

       title
          (Required) A short string describing the purpose of the expression.

       description
          (Optional) Additional description for the expression.

          NOTE: An unsatisfied condition will not allow access via this
          binding.

       --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE
          Path to a local JSON or YAML file that defines the condition. To see
          available fields, see the help for --condition.

     Arguments to locate resources, depending on the platform used. At most one
     of these may be specified:

       Only applicable if connecting to Cloud Run (fully managed). Specify
       --platform=managed to use:

         --region=REGION
            Region in which the resource can be found. Alternatively, set the
            property [run/region].

       Only applicable if connecting to Cloud Run for Anthos deployed on Google
       Cloud. Specify --platform=gke to use:

         Cluster resource - Kubernetes Engine cluster to connect to. The
         arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
         resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group
         but can be set in other ways. To set the [project] attribute: provide
         the argument [--cluster] on the command line with a fully specified
         name; set the property [run/cluster] with a fully specified name;
         specify the cluster from a list of available clusters with a fully
         specified name; provide the argument [--project] on the command line;
         set the property [core/project].

           --cluster=CLUSTER
              ID of the cluster or fully qualified identifier for the cluster.

           --cluster-location=CLUSTER_LOCATION
              Zone in which the cluster is located. Alternatively, set the
              property [run/cluster_location].

       Only applicable if connecting to Cloud Run for Anthos deployed on
       VMware. Specify --platform=kubernetes to use:

         --context=CONTEXT
            The name of the context in your kubectl config file to use for
            connecting.

         --kubeconfig=KUBECONFIG
            The absolute path to your kubectl config file. If not specified,
            the colon- or semicolon-delimited list of paths specified by
            $KUBECONFIG will be used. If $KUBECONFIG is unset, this defaults to
            ~/.kube/config.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the run/v1 API. The full documentation for this API can

EXAMPLES
    To add an IAM policy binding for the role of 'roles/run.invoker' for the
    user 'test-user@gmail.com' with service 'my-service' and region
    'us-central1', run:

        $ gcloud alpha run services add-iam-policy-binding my-service \
            --region='us-central1' --member='user:test-user@gmail.com' \
            --role='roles/run.invoker'

    To add an IAM policy binding which expires at the end of the year 2019 for
    the role of 'roles/run.invoker' and the user 'test-user@gmail.com' with
    service 'my-service' and region 'us-central1', run:

        $ gcloud alpha run services add-iam-policy-binding my-service \
            --region='us-central1' --member='user:test-user@gmail.com' \
            --role='roles/run.invoker' \
            --condition='expression=request.time <
         timestamp("2020-01-01T00:00:00Z"),title=expires_end_of_2019,descrip\
        tion=Expires at midnight on 2019-12-31'

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access whitelist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud run services add-iam-policy-binding
        $ gcloud beta run services add-iam-policy-binding
