SYNOPSIS
    gcloud alpha organizations describe ORGANIZATION_ID [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

      o The active account does not have permission to access the given
        organization.

NOTES
    This command is currently in ALPHA and may change without notice. If this
    command fails with API permission errors despite specifying the right
    project, you may be trying to access an API with an invitation-only early
    access allowlist. These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud organizations describe
        $ gcloud beta organizations describe
