NAME
    gcloud logging read - read log entries

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud logging read [LOG_FILTER] [--freshness=FRESHNESS; default="1d"]
        [--order=ORDER; default="desc"]
        [--billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID | --folder=FOLDER_ID
          | --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID] [--limit=LIMIT]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud logging read reads log entries. Log entries matching log-filter are
    returned in order of decreasing timestamps, most-recent entries first. If
    the log entries come from multiple logs, then entries from different logs
    might be intermingled in the results.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     [LOG_FILTER]
        Filter expression that specifies the log entries to return. A detailed
        guide onbasic and advanced filters can be found at:
        https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/overview)

FLAGS
     --freshness=FRESHNESS; default="1d"
        Return entries that are not older than this value. Works only with DESC
        ordering and filters without a timestamp. See $ gcloud topic datetimes
        for information on duration formats.

     --order=ORDER; default="desc"
        Ordering of returned log entries based on timestamp field. ORDER must
        be one of: desc, asc.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID
          Read log entries associated with this billing account.

       --folder=FOLDER_ID
          Read log entries associated with this folder.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          Read log entries associated with this organization.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --limit=LIMIT
        The maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To read log entries from Google Compute Engine instances, run:

        $ gcloud logging read "resource.type=gce_instance"

    To read log entries with severity ERROR or higher, run:

        $ gcloud logging read "severity>=ERROR"

    To read log entries written in a specific time window, run:

        $ gcloud logging read \
            'timestamp<="2015-05-31T23:59:59Z" AND
         timestamp>="2015-05-31T00:00:00Z"'

    To read up to 10 log entries in your project's syslog log from Compute
    Engine instances containing payloads that include the word SyncAddress and
    format the output in JSON format, run:

        $ gcloud logging read \
            "resource.type=gce_instance AND\
         logName=projects/[PROJECT_ID]/logs/syslog AND\
         textPayload:SyncAddress" --limit=10 --format=json

    To read a log entry from a folder, run:

        $ gcloud logging read "resource.type=global" --folder=[FOLDER_ID] \
            --limit=1
