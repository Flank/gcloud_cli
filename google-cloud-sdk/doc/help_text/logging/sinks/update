NAME
    gcloud logging sinks update - updates a sink

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud logging sinks update SINK_NAME [DESTINATION]
        [--log-filter=LOG_FILTER]
        [--billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID | --folder=FOLDER_ID
          | --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID | --project=PROJECT_ID]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Changes the [destination] or --log-filter associated with a sink. The new
    destination must already exist and Cloud Logging must have permission to
    write to it. Log entries are exported to the new destination immediately.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     SINK_NAME
        The name of the sink to update.

     [DESTINATION]
        A new destination for the sink. If omitted, the sink's existing
        destination is unchanged.

FLAGS
     --log-filter=LOG_FILTER
        A new filter expression for the sink. If omitted, the sink's existing
        filter (if any) is unchanged.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID
          Update a sink associated with this billing account.

       --folder=FOLDER_ID
          Update a sink associated with this folder.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          Update a sink associated with this organization.

       --project=PROJECT_ID
          Update a sink associated with this project.

          The Google Cloud Platform project ID to use for this invocation. If
          omitted, then the current project is assumed; the current project can
          be listed using gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)' and
          can be set using gcloud config set project PROJECTID.

          --project and its fallback core/project property play two roles in
          the invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate
          on. It also specifies the project for API enablement check, quota,
          and billing. To specify a different project for quota and billing,
          use --billing-project or billing/quota_project property.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
