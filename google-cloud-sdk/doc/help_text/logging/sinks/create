NAME
    gcloud logging sinks create - creates a sink

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud logging sinks create SINK_NAME DESTINATION [--include-children]
        [--log-filter=LOG_FILTER]
        [--billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID | --folder=FOLDER_ID
          | --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Creates a sink used to export entries from one or more logs to a
    destination. A sink exports all logs that matches --log-filter flag. An
    empty filter matches all logs. The sink's destination can be a Cloud
    Storage bucket, a BigQuery dataset, or a Cloud Pub/Sub topic. The
    destination must already exist and Stackdriver Logging must have permission
    to write to it. Log entries are exported as soon as the sink is created.
    See
    https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/export/configure_export_v2#dest-auth.
