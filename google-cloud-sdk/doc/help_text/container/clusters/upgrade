NAME
    gcloud container clusters upgrade - upgrade the Kubernetes version of an
        existing container cluster

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud container clusters upgrade NAME [--async]
        [--cluster-version=CLUSTER_VERSION] [--image-type=IMAGE_TYPE]
        [--master] [--node-pool=NODE_POOL] [--zone=ZONE, -z ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Upgrades the Kubernetes version of an existing container cluster.

    This command upgrades the Kubernetes version of the nodes or master of a
    cluster. Note that the Kubernetes version of the cluster's master is also
    periodically upgraded automatically as new releases are available.

    By running this command, all of the cluster's nodes will be deleted and
    recreated one at a time. While persistent Kubernetes resources, such as
    pods backed by replication controllers, will be rescheduled onto new nodes,
    a small cluster may experience a few minutes where there are insufficient
    nodes available to run all of the scheduled Kubernetes resources.

    Please ensure that any data you wish to keep is stored on a persistent disk
    before upgrading the cluster. Ephemeral Kubernetes resources--in
    particular, pods without replication controllers--will be lost, while
    persistent Kubernetes resources will get rescheduled.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        The name of the cluster to upgrade.

FLAGS
     --async
        Don't wait for the operation to complete.

     --cluster-version=CLUSTER_VERSION
        The Kubernetes release version to which to upgrade the cluster's nodes.

        When upgrading nodes, the minor version (X.Y.Z) must be no greater than
        the cluster master's minor version (i.e. if the master's version is
        1.2.34, the nodes cannot be upgraded to 1.3.45). For any minor version,
        only the latest patch version (X.Y.Z) is allowed (i.e. if there exists
        a version 1.2.34, the nodes cannot be upgraded to 1.2.33). Omit to
        upgrade to the same version as the master.

        When upgrading master, the only valid value is the latest supported
        version. Omit to have the server automatically select the latest
        version.

        You can find the list of allowed versions for upgrades by running:

            $ gcloud container get-server-config

     --image-type=IMAGE_TYPE
        The image type to use for the cluster/node pool. Defaults to
        server-specified.

        Image Type specifies the base OS that the nodes in the cluster/node
        pool will run on. If an image type is specified, that will be assigned
        to the cluster/node pool and all future upgrades will use the specified
        image type. If it is not specified the server will pick the default
        image type.

        The default image type and the list of valid image types are available
        using the following command.

            $ gcloud container get-server-config

     --master
        Upgrade the cluster's master to the latest version of Kubernetes
        supported on Kubernetes Engine. Nodes cannot be upgraded at the same
        time as the master.

     --node-pool=NODE_POOL
        The node pool to upgrade.

     --zone=ZONE, -z ZONE
        The compute zone (e.g. us-central1-a) for the cluster. Overrides the
        default compute/zone property value for this command invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    Upgrade the nodes of <cluster> to the Kubernetes version of the cluster's
    master.

        $ gcloud container clusters upgrade <cluster>

    Upgrade the nodes of <cluster> to Kubernetes version x.y.z:

        $ gcloud container clusters upgrade <cluster> \
            --cluster-version "x.y.z"

    Upgrade the master of <cluster> to the latest supported version:

        $ gcloud container clusters upgrade <cluster> --master"

NOTES
    These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud alpha container clusters upgrade
        $ gcloud beta container clusters upgrade
