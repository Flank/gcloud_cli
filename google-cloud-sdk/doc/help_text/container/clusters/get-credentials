NAME
    gcloud container clusters get-credentials - fetch credentials for a running
        cluster

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud container clusters get-credentials NAME
        [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE, -z ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    gcloud container clusters get-credentials updates a kubeconfig file with
    appropriate credentials and endpoint information to point kubectl at a
    specific cluster in Google Kubernetes Engine. It takes a project and a zone
    as parameters, passed through by set defaults or flags. By default,
    credentials are written to HOME/.kube/config. You can provide an alternate
    path by setting the KUBECONFIG environment variable.

    This command enables switching to a specific cluster, when working with
    multiple clusters. It can also be used to access a previously created
    cluster from a new workstation.

    See https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/kubectl for kubectl
    documentation.
