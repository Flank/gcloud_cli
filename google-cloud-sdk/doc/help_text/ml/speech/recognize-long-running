NAME
    gcloud ml speech recognize-long-running - get transcripts of longer audio
        from an audio file

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud ml speech recognize-long-running AUDIO --language-code=LANGUAGE_CODE
        [--async] [--encoding=ENCODING; default="encoding-unspecified"]
        [--filter-profanity] [--hints=[HINTS,...]]
        [--include-word-time-offsets]
        [--max-alternatives=MAX_ALTERNATIVES; default=1]
        [--sample-rate=SAMPLE_RATE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Get a transcript of audio up to 80 minutes in length. If the audio is under
    60 seconds, you may also use gcloud ml speech recognize to analyze it.

    To block the command from completing until analysis is finished, run:

        $ gcloud ml speech recognize-long-running AUDIO_FILE \
            --language-code LANGUAGE_CODE --sample-rate SAMPLE_RATE

    You can also receive an operation as the result of the command by running:

        $ gcloud ml speech recognize-long-running AUDIO_FILE \
            --language-code LANGUAGE_CODE --sample-rate SAMPLE_RATE --async

    This will return information about an operation. To get information about
    the operation, run:

        $ gcloud ml speech operations describe OPERATION_ID

    To poll the operation until it's complete, run:

        $ gcloud ml speech operations wait OPERATION_ID

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     AUDIO
        The location of the audio file to transcribe. Must be a local path or a
        Google Cloud Storage URL (in the format gs://bucket/object).

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --language-code=LANGUAGE_CODE
        The language of the supplied audio as a BCP-47
        (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt) language tag. Example:
        "en-US". See https://cloud.google.com/speech/docs/languages for a list
        of the currently supported language codes.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Display information about the operation in progress, without waiting
        for the operation to complete.

     --encoding=ENCODING; default="encoding-unspecified"
        The type of encoding of the file. Required if the file format is not
        WAV or FLAC. ENCODING must be one of: amr, amr-wb,
        encoding-unspecified, flac, linear16, mulaw, ogg-opus,
        speex-with-header-byte.

     --filter-profanity
        If True, the server will attempt to filter out profanities, replacing
        all but the initial character in each filtered word with asterisks,
        e.g. \"f**\".

     --hints=[HINTS,...]
        A list of strings containing word and phrase "hints" so that the speech
        recognition is more likely to recognize them. This can be used to
        improve the accuracy for specific words and phrases, for example, if
        specific commands are typically spoken by the user. This can also be
        used to add additional words to the vocabulary of the recognizer. See
        https://cloud.google.com/speech/limits#content.

     --include-word-time-offsets
        If True, the top result includes a list of words with the start and end
        time offsets (timestamps) for those words. If False, no word-level time
        offset information is returned.

     --max-alternatives=MAX_ALTERNATIVES; default=1
        Maximum number of recognition hypotheses to be returned. The server may
        return fewer than max_alternatives. Valid values are 0-30. A value of 0
        or 1 will return a maximum of one.

     --sample-rate=SAMPLE_RATE
        The sample rate in Hertz. For best results, set the sampling rate of
        the audio source to 16000 Hz. If that's not possible, use the native
        sample rate of the audio source (instead of re-sampling).

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
