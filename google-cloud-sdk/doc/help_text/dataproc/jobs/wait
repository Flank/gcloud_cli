NAME
    gcloud dataproc jobs wait - view the output of a job as it runs or after it
        completes

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud dataproc jobs wait (JOB : --region=REGION) [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    View the output of a job as it runs or after it completes.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Job resource - The ID of the job to wait for. The arguments in this group
     can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some
     attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other
     ways. To set the [project] attribute: provide the argument [job] on the
     command line with a fully specified name; provide the argument [--project]
     on the command line; set the property [core/project]. This must be
     specified.

       JOB
          ID of the job or fully qualified identifier for the job. This
          positional must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
          group are specified.

       --region=REGION
          Cloud Dataproc region for the job. Each Cloud Dataproc region
          constitutes an independent resource namespace constrained to
          deploying instances into Google Compute Engine zones inside the
          region. The default value of global is a special multi-region
          namespace which is capable of deploying instances into all Google
          Compute Engine zones globally, and is disjoint from other Cloud
          Dataproc regions. Overrides the default dataproc/region property
          value for this command invocation.
