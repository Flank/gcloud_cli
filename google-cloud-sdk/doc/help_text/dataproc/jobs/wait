NAME
    gcloud dataproc jobs wait - view the output of a job as it runs or after it
        completes

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud dataproc jobs wait JOB [--region=REGION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    View the output of a job as it runs or after it completes.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     JOB
        The ID of the job to wait for.

FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        Cloud Dataproc region to use. Each Cloud Dataproc region constitutes an
        independent resource namespace constrained to deploying instances into
        Compute Engine zones inside the region. The default value of global is
        a special multi-region namespace which is capable of deploying
        instances into all Compute Engine zones globally, and is disjoint from
        other Cloud Dataproc regions. Overrides the default dataproc/region
        property value for this command invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To see a list of all jobs, run:

        $ gcloud dataproc jobs list

    To display these jobs with their respective IDs and underlying REST calls,
    run:

        $ gcloud dataproc jobs list --format "table(reference.jobId)" \
          --limit 1 --log-http

    To view the output of a job as it runs, run:

        $ gcloud dataproc jobs wait job_id

NOTES
    This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta dataproc jobs wait
