NAME
    gcloud dataproc operations delete - delete the record of an inactive
        operation

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud dataproc operations delete OPERATION [--region=REGION]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Delete the record of an inactive operation.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     OPERATION
        The ID of the operation to delete.

FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        Cloud Dataproc region to use. Each Cloud Dataproc region constitutes an
        independent resource namespace constrained to deploying instances into
        Compute Engine zones inside the region. The default value of global is
        a special multi-region namespace which is capable of deploying
        instances into all Compute Engine zones globally, and is disjoint from
        other Cloud Dataproc regions. Overrides the default dataproc/region
        property value for this command invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

EXAMPLES
    To delete the record of an operation, run:

        $ gcloud dataproc operations delete operation_id

NOTES
    This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta dataproc operations delete
