NAME
    gcloud dataproc operations describe - view the details of an operation

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud dataproc operations describe OPERATION [--region=REGION]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    View the details of an operation.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     OPERATION
        The ID of the operation to describe.

FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        Specifies the Cloud Dataproc region to use. Each Cloud Dataproc region
        constitutes an independent resource namespace constrained to deploying
        instances into Google Compute Engine zones inside the region. The
        default value of "global" is a special multi-region namespace which is
        capable of deploying instances into all Google Compute Engine zones
        globally, and is disjoint from other Cloud Dataproc regions. Overrides
        the default dataproc/region property value for this command invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To view the details of an operation, run:

        $ gcloud dataproc operations describe operation_id

NOTES
    This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta dataproc operations describe
