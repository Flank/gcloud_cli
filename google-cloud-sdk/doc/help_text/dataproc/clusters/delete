NAME
    gcloud dataproc clusters delete - delete a cluster

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud dataproc clusters delete NAME [--async] [--region=REGION]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Delete a cluster.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        The name of the cluster to delete.

FLAGS
     --async
        Display information about the operation in progress, without waiting
        for the operation to complete.

     --region=REGION
        Specifies the Cloud Dataproc region to use. Each Cloud Dataproc region
        constitutes an independent resource namespace constrained to deploying
        instances into Google Compute Engine zones inside the region. The
        default value of "global" is a special multi-region namespace which is
        capable of deploying instances into all Google Compute Engine zones
        globally, and is disjoint from other Cloud Dataproc regions. Overrides
        the default dataproc/region property value for this command invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To delete a cluster, run:

        $ gcloud dataproc clusters delete my_cluster

NOTES
    This variant is also available:

        $ gcloud beta dataproc clusters delete
