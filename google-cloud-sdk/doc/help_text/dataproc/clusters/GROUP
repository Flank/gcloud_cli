NAME
    gcloud dataproc clusters - create and manage Google Cloud Dataproc clusters

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud dataproc clusters COMMAND [--region=REGION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Create and manage Google Cloud Dataproc clusters.

FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        Cloud Dataproc region to use. Each Cloud Dataproc region constitutes an
        independent resource namespace constrained to deploying instances into
        Compute Engine zones inside the region. The default value of global is
        a special multi-region namespace which is capable of deploying
        instances into all Compute Engine zones globally, and is disjoint from
        other Cloud Dataproc regions. Overrides the default dataproc/region
        property value for this command invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.
