NAME
    gcloud projects list - list projects accessible by the active account

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud projects list [--filter=EXPRESSION] [--limit=LIMIT]
        [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE] [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]] [--uri]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Lists all active projects, where the active account has Owner, Editor or
    Viewer permissions. Projects are listed in alphabetical order by project
    name. Projects that have been deleted or are pending deletion are not
    included.

    You can specify the maximum number of projects to list using the --limit
    flag.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        The maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        A comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --uri
        Print a list of resource URIs instead of the default output.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    The following command lists a maximum of five projects sorted
    alphabetically by name:

        $ gcloud projects list --limit=5

NOTES
    These variants are also available:

        $ gcloud alpha projects list
        $ gcloud beta projects list
