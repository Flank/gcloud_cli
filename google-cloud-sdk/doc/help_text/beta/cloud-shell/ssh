    gcloud beta cloud-shell ssh - allows you to establish an interactive SSH
        session with Cloud Shell

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta cloud-shell ssh [--authorize-session] [--boosted]
        [--command=COMMAND] [--dry-run] [--force-key-file-overwrite]
        [--ssh-flag=SSH_FLAG] [--ssh-key-file] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta cloud-shell ssh lets you remotely log in to Cloud Shell.
    If your Cloud Shell is not currently running, this will cause it to be
    started before establishing the SSH session.

FLAGS
     --authorize-session
        If provided, sends OAuth credentials to the current Cloud Shell session
        on behalf of the user. When this completes, the session will be
        authorized to run various Google Cloud command-line tools without
        requiring the user to manually authenticate.

     --boosted
        If provided, starts Cloud Shell in boost mode. If there is alread a
        running Cloud Shell session that is not boosted, this will restart the
        session.

     --command=COMMAND
        A command to run in Cloud Shell.

        Runs the command in Cloud Shell and then exits.

     --dry-run
        If provided, prints the command that would be run to standard out
        instead of executing it.

     --force-key-file-overwrite
        If enabled gcloud will regenerate and overwrite the files associated
        with a broken SSH key without asking for confirmation in both
        interactive and non-interactive environment.

        If disabled gcloud will not attempt to regenerate the files associated
        with a broken SSH key and fail in both interactive and non-interactive
        environment.

     --ssh-flag=SSH_FLAG
        Additional flags to be passed to ssh(1).

     --ssh-key-file
        The path to the SSH key file. By default, this is
        ~/.ssh/google_compute_engine.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.
