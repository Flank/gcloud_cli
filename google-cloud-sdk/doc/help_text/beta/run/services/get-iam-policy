NAME
    gcloud beta run services get-iam-policy - get the IAM policy for a Cloud
        Run service

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta run services get-iam-policy (SERVICE : --region=REGION)
        [--platform=PLATFORM] [--filter=EXPRESSION] [--limit=LIMIT]
        [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE] [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) This command gets the IAM policy for a service. If formatted as
    JSON, the output can be edited and used as a policy file for
    set-iam-policy. The output includes an "etag" field identifying the version
    emitted and allowing detection of concurrent policy updates; see $ gcloud
    alpha run registries set-iam-policy for additional details.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Service resource - The service for which to display the IAM policy. The
     arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways. To set the [project] attribute: provide the
     argument [service] on the command line with a fully specified name; set
     the property [core/project]; provide the argument [--project] on the
     command line. This must be specified.

       SERVICE
          ID of the service or fully qualified identifier for the service. This
          positional must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
          group are specified.

       --region=REGION
          The Cloud Run region.

FLAGS
     --platform=PLATFORM
        Target platform for running commands. PLATFORM must be one of:

         gke
            Cloud Run on Google Kubernetes Engine. This platform is not
            supported by this command.

         managed
            Fully managed version of Cloud Run. Use with the --region flag or
            set the [run/region] property to specify a Cloud Run region.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.
