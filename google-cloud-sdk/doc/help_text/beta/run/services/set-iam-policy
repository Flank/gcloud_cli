NAME
    gcloud beta run services set-iam-policy - set the IAM policy for a service

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta run services set-iam-policy (SERVICE : --region=REGION)
        POLICY_FILE [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) This command replaces the existing IAM policy for a service, given a
    service and a file encoded in JSON or YAML that contains the IAM policy. If
    the given policy file specifies an "etag" value, then the replacement will
    succeed only if the policy already in place matches that etag. (An etag
    obtain via get-iam-policy will prevent the replacement if the policy for
    the service has been subsequently updated.) A policy file that does not
    contain an etag value will replace any existing policy for the service.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Service resource - The service for which to set the IAM policy. The
     arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways. To set the [project] attribute: provide the
     argument [service] on the command line with a fully specified name; set
     the property [core/project]; provide the argument [--project] on the
     command line. This must be specified.

       SERVICE
          ID of the service or fully qualified identifier for the service. This
          positional must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
          group are specified.

       --region=REGION
          The Cloud Run region

     POLICY_FILE
        Path to a local JSON or YAML formatted file containing a valid policy.

        The output of the get-iam-policy command is a valid file, as is any
        JSON or YAML file conforming to the structure of a Policy
        (https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/Policy).

            my-service policy.json
