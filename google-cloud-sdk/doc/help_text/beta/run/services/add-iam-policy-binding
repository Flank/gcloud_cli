NAME
    gcloud beta run services add-iam-policy-binding - add IAM policy binding to
        a Cloud Run service

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta run services add-iam-policy-binding (SERVICE : --region=REGION)
        --member=MEMBER --role=ROLE [--platform=PLATFORM]
        [--condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          | --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Add an IAM policy binding to the IAM policy of a Cloud Run service.
    One binding consists of a member, a role, and an optional condition.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Service resource - The service for which to add IAM policy binding to. The
     arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways. To set the [project] attribute: provide the
     argument [service] on the command line with a fully specified name; set
     the property [core/project]; provide the argument [--project] on the
     command line. This must be specified.

       SERVICE
          ID of the service or fully qualified identifier for the service. This
          positional must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
          group are specified.

       --region=REGION
          The Cloud Run region.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --member=MEMBER
        The member to add the binding for. Should be of the form
        user|group|serviceAccount:email or domain:domain.

        Examples: user:test-user@gmail.com, group:admins@example.com,
        serviceAccount:test123@example.domain.com, or
        domain:example.domain.com.

        Can also be one of the following special values:
        * allUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone who is on the
          internet, with or without a Google account.
        * allAuthenticatedUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone
          who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account.

     --role=ROLE
        Define the role of the member.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --platform=PLATFORM
        Target platform for running commands. PLATFORM must be one of:

         gke
            Cloud Run on Google Kubernetes Engine. This platform is not
            supported by this command.

         managed
            Fully managed version of Cloud Run. Use with the --region flag or
            set the [run/region] property to specify a Cloud Run region.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          Condition of the binding to be added. When condition is explicitly
          specified as None (e.g. --condition=None), a binding without a
          condition is added. When --condition is specified and is not a None
          condition, --role cannot be a primitive role. Primitive roles are
          roles/editor, roles/owner, and roles/viewer.

       expression
          (Required) Expression of the condition which evaluates to True or
          False. This uses a subset of Common Expression Language syntax.

       title
          (Required) Title for the expression, i.e. a short string describing
          its purpose.

       description
          (Optional) Description for the expression. This is a longer text
          which describes the expression.

          NOTE: An unsatisfied condition will not allow access via this
          binding.

       --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE
          Path to a local JSON or YAML file that defines the condition. To see
          available fields, see the help for --condition.

    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
