        (FHIR_STORE : --dataset=DATASET --location=LOCATION) --member=MEMBER

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Adds an IAM policy binding to a Cloud Healthcare API FHIR store.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     FhirStore resource - Cloud Healthcare API FHIR store to add an IAM policy
     binding to. The arguments in this group can be used to specify the
     attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the [project]
     attribute: provide the argument [fhir_store] on the command line with a
     fully specified name; provide the argument [--project] on the command
     line; set the property [core/project]. This must be specified.

       FHIR_STORE
          ID of the fhirStore or fully qualified identifier for the fhirStore.
          This positional must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --dataset=DATASET
          Cloud Healthcare dataset.

       --location=LOCATION
          Google Cloud location.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --member=MEMBER
        The member to add the binding for. Should be of the form
        user|group|serviceAccount:email or domain:domain.

        Examples: user:test-user@gmail.com, group:admins@example.com,
        serviceAccount:test123@example.domain.com, or
        domain:example.domain.com.

        Can also be one of the following special values:
        * allUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone who is on the
          internet, with or without a Google account.
        * allAuthenticatedUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone
          who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account.

     --role=ROLE
        Define the role of the member.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     At most one of these may be specified:

       --condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          The condition of the binding to be added. When the condition is
          explicitly specified as None (--condition=None), a binding without a
          condition is added. When the condition is specified and is not None,
          --role cannot be a primitive role. Primitive roles are roles/editor,
          roles/owner, and roles/viewer.

       expression
          (Required) Expression of the condition which evaluates to True or
          False. This uses a subset of Common Expression Language syntax.

       title
          (Required) A short string describing the purpose of the expression.

       description
          (Optional) Additional description for the expression.

          NOTE: An unsatisfied condition will not allow access via this
          binding.

       --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE
          Path to a local JSON or YAML file that defines the condition. To see
          available fields, see the help for --condition.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
