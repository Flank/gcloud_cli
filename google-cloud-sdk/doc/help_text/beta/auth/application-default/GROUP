NAME
    gcloud beta auth application-default - manage your active Application
        Default Credentials

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta auth application-default COMMAND [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Application Default Credentials (ADC) provide a method to get
    credentials used in calling Google APIs. The gcloud beta auth
    application-default command group allows you to manage active credentials
    on your machine that are used for local application development.

    These credentials are only used by Google client libraries in your own
    application.

    More information on ADC and how they work can be found here:
    https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

COMMANDS
    COMMAND is one of the following:

     login
        (BETA) Acquire new user credentials to use for Application Default
        Credentials.

     print-access-token
        (BETA) Print an access token for your current Application Default
        Credentials.

     revoke

EXAMPLES
    To create a service account and have your application use it for API
    access, run:

        $ gcloud iam service-accounts create my-account
        $ gcloud iam service-accounts keys create key.json
          --iam-account=my-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
        $ export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=key.json
        $ ./my_application.sh

    To temporarily use your own user credentials, run:

        $ gcloud beta auth application-default login

    This will take you through a web flow to acquire new user credentials.
