NAME
    gcloud beta auth login - authorize gcloud to access the Cloud Platform with
        Google user credentials

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta auth login [ACCOUNT] [--no-activate] [--brief]
        [--enable-gdrive-access] [--force] [--no-launch-browser]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Obtains access credentials for your user account via a web-based
    authorization flow. When this command completes successfully, it sets the
    active account in the current configuration to the account specified. If no
    configuration exists, it creates a configuration named default.

    If valid credentials for an account are already available from a prior
    authorization, the account is set to active without rerunning the flow.

    Use gcloud auth list to view credentialed accounts.

    If you'd rather authorize without a web browser but still interact with the
    command line, use the --no-launch-browser flag. To authorize without a web
    browser and non-interactively, create a service account with the
    appropriate scopes using the Google Cloud Platform Console
    (https://console.cloud.google.com) and use gcloud auth
    activate-service-account with the corresponding JSON key file.

    For more information on authorization and credential types, see:
    https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/authorizing.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     [ACCOUNT]
        User account used for authorization.

FLAGS
     --activate
        Set the new account to active. Enabled by default, use --no-activate to

     --enable-gdrive-access

     --force
        Re-run the web authorization flow even if the given account has valid
        credentials.

     --launch-browser
        Launch a browser for authorization. If not enabled or DISPLAY variable
        is not set, prints a URL to standard output to be copied. Enabled by
