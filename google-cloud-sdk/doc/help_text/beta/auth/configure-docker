NAME
    gcloud beta auth configure-docker - registers gcloud as a Docker credential
        helper

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta auth configure-docker [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Adds Docker credHelper entry to Docker's configuration file, or
    creates the file if it doesn't exist, which will register gcloud as the
    credential helper for all Google supported Docker registries.

    If Docker configuration already contains a credHelper entry it will be
    overwritten.

    See
    https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/#credential-helpers
    for more details on Docker credential helpers.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in BETA and may change without notice. This
    variant is also available:

        $ gcloud alpha auth configure-docker
