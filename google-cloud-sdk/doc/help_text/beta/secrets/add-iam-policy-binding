NAME
    gcloud beta secrets add-iam-policy-binding - add IAM policy binding to a
        secret

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta secrets add-iam-policy-binding SECRET --member=MEMBER
        --role=ROLE
        [--condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          | --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Add an IAM policy binding to the IAM policy of a secret. One binding
    consists of a member and a role.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Secret resource - Name of the secret for which to add the IAM policy
     binding. This represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not
     given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the
     [project] attribute: provide the argument [secret] on the command line
     with a fully specified name; set the property [core/project]; provide the
     argument [--project] on the command line. This must be specified.

       SECRET
          ID of the secret or fully qualified identifier for the secret.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --member=MEMBER
        The member to add the binding for. Should be of the form
        user|group|serviceAccount:email or domain:domain.

        Examples: user:test-user@gmail.com, group:admins@example.com,
        serviceAccount:test123@example.domain.com, or
        domain:example.domain.com.

        Can also be one of the following special values:
        * allUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone who is on the
          internet, with or without a Google account.
        * allAuthenticatedUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone
          who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account.

     --role=ROLE
        Define the role of the member.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     At most one of these may be specified:

       --condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          The condition of the binding to be added. When the condition is
          explicitly specified as None (--condition=None), a binding without a
          condition is added. When the condition is specified and is not None,
          --role cannot be a primitive role. Primitive roles are roles/editor,
          roles/owner, and roles/viewer.

       expression
          (Required) Expression of the condition which evaluates to True or
          False. This uses a subset of Common Expression Language syntax.

       title
          (Required) A short string describing the purpose of the expression.

       description
          (Optional) Additional description for the expression.

          NOTE: An unsatisfied condition will not allow access via this
          binding.

       --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE
          Path to a local JSON or YAML file that defines the condition. To see
          available fields, see the help for --condition.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    'roles/secretmanager.secretReader' for the user 'test-user@gmail.com' on

    See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details of
    policy role and member types.
