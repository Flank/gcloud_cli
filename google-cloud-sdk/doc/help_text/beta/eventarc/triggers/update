DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Update an Eventarc trigger.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Trigger resource - The trigger to update. The arguments in this group can
     be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes
     are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set
     the [project] attribute: provide the argument [trigger] on the command
     line with a fully specified name; provide the argument [--project] on the
     command line; set the property [core/project]. This must be specified.

       TRIGGER
          ID of the trigger or fully qualified identifier for the trigger. This
          positional must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
          group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location for the Eventarc resource. Alternatively, set the
          [eventarc/location] property.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --destination-run-region=DESTINATION_RUN_REGION
        The region in which the destination Cloud Run service can be found. If
        not specified, it is assumed that the service is in the same region as
        the trigger.

     --destination-run-service=DESTINATION_RUN_SERVICE
        The name of the Cloud Run fully-managed service that receives the
        events for the trigger. The service must be in the same project as the
        trigger.

     --matching-criteria=[ATTRIBUTE=VALUE,...]
        The criteria by which events are filtered for the trigger, specified as
        a comma-separated list of CloudEvents attribute names and values. This
        flag can also be repeated to add more criteria to the list. Only events
        that match with this criteria will be sent to the destination. The
        criteria must include the type attribute, as well as any other
        attributes that are expected for the chosen type.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --clear-destination-run-path
          Clear the relative path on the destination Cloud Run service to which
          the events for the trigger should be sent.

       --destination-run-path=DESTINATION_RUN_PATH
          The relative path on the destination Cloud Run service to which the
          events for the trigger should be sent. Examples: /route, route,
          route/subroute.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       Service account resource - The IAM service account associated with the
       trigger, specified with an email address or a uniqueId. If not
       specified, the default compute service account will be used. Unless a
       full resource name is provided, the service account is assumed to be in
       the same project as the trigger. This represents a Cloud resource.
       (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be
       set in other ways. To set the [project] attribute: provide the argument
       [--service-account] on the command line with a fully specified name;
       provide the argument [--project] on the command line; set the property
       [core/project].

         --service-account=SERVICE_ACCOUNT
            ID of the service account or fully qualified identifier for the
            service account.

       --clear-service-account
          Clear the IAM service account associated with the trigger and use the
          default compute service account instead.
