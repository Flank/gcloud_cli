DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Create an Eventarc trigger.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Trigger resource - The trigger to create. The arguments in this group can
     be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes
     are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set
     the [project] attribute: provide the argument [trigger] on the command
     line with a fully specified name; provide the argument [--project] on the
     command line; set the property [core/project]. This must be specified.

       TRIGGER
          ID of the trigger or fully qualified identifier for the trigger. This
          positional must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
          group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location for the Eventarc trigger, which should be either global
          or one of the supported regions. Alternatively, set the
          [eventarc/location] property.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --destination-run-service=DESTINATION_RUN_SERVICE
        The name of the Cloud Run fully-managed service that receives the
        events for the trigger. The service must be in the same project as the
        trigger.

     --matching-criteria=[ATTRIBUTE=VALUE,...]
        The criteria by which events are filtered for the trigger, specified as
        a comma-separated list of CloudEvents attribute names and values. This
        flag can also be repeated to add more criteria to the list. Only events
        that match with this criteria will be sent to the destination. The
        criteria must include the type attribute, as well as any other
        attributes that are expected for the chosen type.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     Service account resource - The IAM service account associated with the
     trigger, specified with an email address or a uniqueId. If not specified,
     the default compute service account will be used. Unless a full resource
     name is provided, the service account is assumed to be in the same project
     as the trigger. This represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes
     are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set
     the [project] attribute: provide the argument [--service-account] on the
     command line with a fully specified name; provide the argument [--project]
     on the command line; set the property [core/project].

       --service-account=SERVICE_ACCOUNT
          ID of the service account or fully qualified identifier for the
          service account.

     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --destination-run-path=DESTINATION_RUN_PATH
        The relative path on the destination Cloud Run service to which the
        events for the trigger should be sent. Examples: /route, route,
        route/subroute.

     --destination-run-region=DESTINATION_RUN_REGION
        The region in which the destination Cloud Run service can be found. If
        not specified, it is assumed that the service is in the same region as
        the trigger.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To create a new trigger my-trigger for events of type
    google.cloud.pubsub.topic.v1.messagePublished with destination Cloud Run
    service my-service, run:

        $ gcloud beta eventarc triggers create my-trigger \
             --matching-criteria="type=google.cloud.pubsub.topic.v1.messagePu\
         blished" --destination-run-service=my-service
