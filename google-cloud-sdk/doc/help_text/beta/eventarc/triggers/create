SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta eventarc triggers create (TRIGGER : --location=LOCATION)
        --matching-criteria=[ATTRIBUTE=VALUE,...]
        (--destination-run-service=DESTINATION_RUN_SERVICE
          : --destination-run-location=DESTINATION_RUN_LOCATION)
        --service-account=SERVICE_ACCOUNT [--async]
        [--destination-run-path=DESTINATION_RUN_PATH] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Create an Eventarc trigger.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Trigger resource - The trigger to create. The arguments in this group can
     be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes
     are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set
     the [project] attribute: provide the argument [trigger] on the command
     line with a fully specified name; provide the argument [--project] on the
     command line; set the property [core/project]. This must be specified.

       TRIGGER
          ID of the trigger or fully qualified identifier for the trigger. This
          positional must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
          group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location for the Eventarc resource. Alternatively, set the
          [eventarc/location] property.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --matching-criteria=[ATTRIBUTE=VALUE,...]
        The criteria by which events are filtered for the trigger, specified as
        a comma-separated list of CloudEvents attribute names and values. This
        flag can also be repeated to add more criteria to the list. Only events
        that match with this criteria will be sent to the destination. The
        criteria must include the type attribute, as well as any other
        attributes that are expected for the chosen type.

     Destination Cloud Run service resource - The Cloud Run fully-managed
     service that receives the events for the trigger. The service must be in
     the same location as the trigger unless the trigger's location is global,
     in which case the service must be in a different location. The arguments
     in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource.
     (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be
     set in other ways. To set the [project] attribute: provide the argument
     [--destination-run-service] on the command line with a fully specified
     name; provide the argument [--project] on the command line; set the
     property [core/project]. This must be specified.

       --destination-run-service=DESTINATION_RUN_SERVICE
          ID of the destination Cloud Run service or fully qualified identifier
          for the destination Cloud Run service. This flag must be specified if
          any of the other arguments in this group are specified.

       --destination-run-location=DESTINATION_RUN_LOCATION
          The location of the destination Cloud Run service. If not specified,
          the trigger's location will be used.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     Service account resource - The IAM service account associated with the
     trigger, specified with an email address or a uniqueId. If not specified,
     the default compute service account will be used. Unless a full resource
     name is provided, the service account is assumed to be in the same project
     as the trigger. This represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes
     are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set
     the [project] attribute: provide the argument [--service-account] on the
     command line with a fully specified name; provide the argument [--project]
     on the command line; set the property [core/project].

       --service-account=SERVICE_ACCOUNT
          ID of the service account or fully qualified identifier for the
          service account.

     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --destination-run-path=DESTINATION_RUN_PATH
        The relative path on the destination Cloud Run service to which the
        events for the trigger should be sent. Examples: "/route", "route",
        "route/subroute".

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To create a new trigger 'my-trigger' for events of type
    'google.cloud.pubsub.topic.v1.messagePublished' with destination Cloud Run
    service 'my-service', run:

        $ gcloud beta eventarc triggers create my-trigger \
             --matching-criteria="type=google.cloud.pubsub.topic.v1.messagePu\
         blished" --destination-run-service=my-service
