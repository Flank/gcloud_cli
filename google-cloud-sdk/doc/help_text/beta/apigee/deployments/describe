    REVISION can either be a positive revision number, or the special value
    auto, which will choose whichever revision of API is currently deployed in
    ENVIRONMENT, or return an error if more than one revision is deployed.

    If REVISION is unspecified, the default is auto.

        The arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource.

         [REVISION]
            ID of the revision or fully qualified identifier for the revision.

         --api=API
            Deployed API proxy.

            Environment in which the proxy was deployed.

         --organization=ORGANIZATION
            Apigee Organization of the proxy and environment. If unspecified,
            the Cloud Platform project's associated organization will be used.

    To get the status of a deployment in an organization called my-org, which
    deploys version 3 of the proxy my-proxy into the test environment, run:
