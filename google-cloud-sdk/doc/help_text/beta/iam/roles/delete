NAME
    gcloud beta iam roles delete - delete a custom role from an organization or
        a project

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta iam roles delete ROLE_ID
        (--organization=ORGANIZATION | --project=PROJECT_ID)
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) This command deletes a role.

    This command can fail for the following reasons:
      o The role specified does not exist.
      o The active user does not have permission to access the given role.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     ROLE_ID
        The id of the custom role to delete. For example: CustomRole. You must
        also specify the --organization or --project flag.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --organization=ORGANIZATION
          The organization of the role you want to delete.

       --project=PROJECT_ID
          The project of the role you want to delete.

          The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
          omitted, then the current project is assumed; the current project can
          be listed using gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)' and
          can be set using gcloud config set project PROJECTID.

          --project and its fallback core/project property play two roles in
          the invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate
          on. It also specifies the project for API enablement check, quota,
          and billing. To specify a different project for quota and billing,
          use --billing-project or billing/quota_project property.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

        $ gcloud beta iam roles delete --organization 1234567 viewer

    To delete a role of a project, run:
