DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Remove an IAM policy binding of a service account.

    When managing IAM roles, you can treat a service account either as a
    resource or as an identity. This command is to remove a policy binding from
    a service account resource. There are other gcloud commands to manage IAM
    policies for other types of resources. For example, to manage IAM policies
    on a project, use the $ gcloud projects commands.

     policy binding from. This represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some
     attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other
     ways. To set the [project] attribute: provide the argument
     [service_account] on the command line with a fully specified name; set the
     property [core/project]; provide the argument [--project] on the command
     line. This must be specified.
