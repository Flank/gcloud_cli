DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Add an IAM policy binding to an IAM Service Account.

    When managing IAM roles, you can treat a service account either as a
    resource or as an identity. This command is to add iam policy bindings to a
    service account resource. There are other gcloud commands to manage IAM
    policies for other types of resources. For example, to manage IAM policies
    on a project, use the $ gcloud projects commands.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     ServiceAccount resource - The Service Account to which to add the IAM
     policy binding. This represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes
     are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set
     the [project] attribute: provide the argument [service_account] on the
     command line with a fully specified name; set the property [core/project];
     provide the argument [--project] on the command line. This must be
     specified.

          serviceAccount.

REQUIRED FLAGS

        serviceAccount:test123@example.domain.com, or
        domain:example.domain.com.

        * allUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone who is on the
          internet, with or without a Google account.
        * allAuthenticatedUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone
          who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account.
