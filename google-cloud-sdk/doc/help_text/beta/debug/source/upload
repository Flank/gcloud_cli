NAME
    gcloud beta debug source upload - upload a directory tree

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta debug source upload DIRECTORY [--branch=BRANCH]
        [--ignore-file=IGNORE_FILE]
        [--source-context-directory=SOURCE_CONTEXT_DIRECTORY]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta debug source upload is used to upload a directory tree
    to a branch in the repository 'google-source-captures' hosted on Cloud
    Source Repositories.

    The files and branches can be managed with git like any other repository.

    When the upload is finished, this command can also produce a source context
    json file named 'source-context.json' describing it.

    See https://cloud.google.com/debugger/docs/source-context for information
    on where to deploy the 'source-context.json' file so Cloud Debugger
    automatically displays the uploaded files.

    NOTE: This command assumes that the 'google-source-captures' repository
    hosted on Cloud Source Repositories already exists, if it does not, this
    command will fail and the appropriate command to create it will be provided
    in the error message.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     DIRECTORY
        The directory tree to upload. If there is a file called .gcloudignore
        in the directory to upload, the files that it specifies will be
        ignored. If a .gitignore file is present in the top-level directory to
        upload and there isn't a .gcloudignore file, gcloud will generate a
        Git-compatible .gcloudignore file that respects your .gitignore-ed
        files. The global .gitignore is not respected.

FLAGS
     --branch=BRANCH
        The branch name. If the branch already exists, the new upload will
        overwrite its history.

     --ignore-file=IGNORE_FILE
        Override the .gcloudignore file and use the specified file instead. See
        $ gcloud topic gcloudignore for more information.

     --source-context-directory=SOURCE_CONTEXT_DIRECTORY
        The directory in which to create the source context file.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To upload the directory tree rooted with the current local directory to
    branch 'my-branch-name' in the git repository 'google-source-captures'
    hosted on Cloud Source Repositories under the project name 'my-project',
    run:

        $ gcloud beta debug source upload --project=my-project \
            --branch=my-branch-name .

NOTES
    This command is currently in BETA and may change without notice.
