NAME
    gcloud beta debug source upload - upload a directory tree

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta debug source upload DIRECTORY [--branch=BRANCH]
        [--source-context-directory=SOURCE_CONTEXT_DIRECTORY]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) This command uploads a directory tree to a branch in the repository
    'google-source-captures' hosted on Cloud Source Repositories.

    The files and branches can be managed with git like any other repository.

    When uploading is done, this command can also produce a source context json
    file describing it.

    See https://cloud.google.com/debugger/docs/source-context for details on
    where to deploy the source context json file in order to enable Stackdriver
    tools to display the uploaded files.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     DIRECTORY
        The directory tree to upload. If there is a file called .gcloudignore
        in the directory to upload, the files that it specifies will be
        ignored. If a .gitignore file is present in the top-level directory to
        upload and there isn't a .gcloudignore file, gcloud will generate a
        Git-compatible .gcloudignore file that respects your .gitignore-ed
        files. The global .gitignore is not respected.

FLAGS
     --branch=BRANCH
        The branch name. If the branch already exists, the new upload will
        overwrite its history.

     --source-context-directory=SOURCE_CONTEXT_DIRECTORY
        The directory in which to create the source context file.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in BETA and may change without notice.
