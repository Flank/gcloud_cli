NAME
    gcloud beta debug snapshots delete - delete debug snapshots

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta debug snapshots delete [ID ...] [--all-users]
        [--include-inactive] [--location=LOCATION-REGEXP]
        [--target=(ID|DESCRIPTION_REGEXP)] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) This command deletes snapshots from a Cloud Debugger debug target.
    It will ask for confirmation before deleting any snapshots. To suppress
    confirmation, use the global --quiet option.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     [ID ...]
        Zero or more snapshot resource identifiers. The specified snapshots
        will be deleted.

FLAGS
     --all-users
        If set, matching snapshots from all users will be deleted, rather than
        only snapshots created by the current user.

     --include-inactive
        If set, also delete snapshots which have been completed. By default,
        only pending snapshots will be deleted.

     --location=LOCATION-REGEXP
        A regular expression to match against snapshot locations. All snapshots
        matching this value will be deleted. You may specify --location
        multiple times.

        EXAMPLE:

            gcloud beta debug snapshots delete \
                --location foo.py:[1-3] --location bar.py:4

     --target=(ID|DESCRIPTION_REGEXP)
        The debug target. It may be a target ID or name obtained from 'debug
        targets list', or it may be a regular expression uniquely specifying a
        debuggee based on its description or name. For App Engine projects, if
        not specified, the default target is the most recent deployment of the
        default module and version.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
