DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Searches all IAM policies under a given scope (i.e., an
    organization, a folder, or a project) with
    cloudasset.assets.searchAllIamPolicies permission.

FLAGS
     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        The page size for search result pagination. The number of matching
        results may be fewer than requested based on the query. The maximum
        page size is 2000. If page-size is not given the back end will pick an
        appropriate default page size.

     --page-token=PAGE_TOKEN
        If present, retrieve the next batch of results from the preceding call
        to this method. page_token must be the value of next_page_token from
        the previous response. The values of all other method parameters must
        be identical to those in the previous call.

     --query=QUERY
        The query statement.

        Examples:
        * To find all Cloud IAM policies in your organization that contain
          amy@mycompany.com: policy:"amy@mydomain.com"
        * To find all Cloud IAM policies in your organization that contain
          owner role: policy:"roles/owner"
        * To find all Cloud IAM policies in your organization which have
          myuser@mycompany.com in the owner role: policy:("roles/owner"
          "myuser@mycompany.com")
        * To find all Cloud IAM policies in your organization which have
          myuser@mycompany.com in the owner role or youruser@mycompany.com in
          the viewer role: policy:(("roles/owner" "myuser@mycompany.com") OR
          ("roles/viewer" "youruser@mycompany.com"))
        * To find all Cloud IAM policies that are set on a resource:
          resource: "projects/123"
        * To find all Cloud IAM policies of resources that match a query.
          resource: "proj"

     --scope=SCOPE
        The search result scope is limited within a project, folder, or
        organization. You must have the cloudasset.assets.searchAllIamPolicies
        permission granted to the caller for the desired scope. The allowed
        value must be one of the following:
        * Organization number (i.e. "organizations/123")
        * Folder number(i.e. "folders/1234")
        * Project number (i.e. "projects/12345")
    If not specified, it will use your configured project in $ gcloud config
    list project. You can change this setting by running $ gcloud config set
    project PROJECT_ID.
