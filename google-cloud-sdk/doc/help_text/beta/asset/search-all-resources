NAME
    gcloud beta asset search-all-resources - searches all Cloud resources
        within the specified accessible scope, such as a project, folder or
        organization

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta asset search-all-resources [--asset-types=[ASSET_TYPES,...]]
        [--order-by=ORDER_BY] [--query=QUERY] [--scope=SCOPE]
        [--filter=EXPRESSION] [--limit=LIMIT] [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE]
        [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Searches all Cloud resources within the specified scope, such as a
    project, folder or organization. The caller must be granted the
    cloudasset.assets.searchAllResources permission on the desired scope.

FLAGS
     --asset-types=[ASSET_TYPES,...]
        A list of asset types to search. If not specified or empty, it will
        search all the searchable asset types
        (https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/supported-asset-types#searchable_asset_types).
        Example:
        cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/Project,compute.googleapis.com/Instance
        to search project and VM instance resources.

     --order-by=ORDER_BY
        A comma-separated list of fields specifying the sorting order of the
        results. The default order is ascending. Add DESC after the field name
        to indicate descending order. Redundant space characters are ignored.
        Example: location DESC, name. Only string fields in the response are
        sortable, including name, displayName, description and location.

        Both --order-by and --sort-by flags can be used to sort the output,
        with the following differences:

        * The --order-by flag performs server-side sorting (better
          performance), while the --sort-by flag performs client-side sorting.
        * The --sort-by flag supports all the fields in the output, while the
          --order-by flag only supports limited fields as shown above.

     --query=QUERY
        The query statement. See how to construct a query
        (https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/searching-resources#how_to_construct_a_query)
        for more details. If not specified or empty, it will search all the
        resources within the specified scope.

        Examples:

        * name:Important to find Cloud resources whose name contains
          Important as a word.
        * displayName:Impor* to find Cloud resources whose display name
          contains Impor as a prefix.
        * description:*por* to find Cloud resources whose description
          contains por as a substring.
        * location:us-west* to find Cloud resources whose location is
          prefixed with us-west.
        * labels:prod to find Cloud resources whose labels contain prod as a
          key or value.
        * labels.env:prod to find Cloud resources that have a label env and
          its value is prod.
        * labels.env:* to find Cloud resources that have a label env.
        * Important to find Cloud resources that contain Important as a word
          in any of the searchable fields.
        * Impor* to find Cloud resources that contain Impor as a prefix in
          any of the searchable fields.
        * *por* to find Cloud resources that contain por as a substring in
          any of the searchable fields.
        * Important location:(us-west1 OR global) to find Cloud resources
          that contain Important as a word in any of the searchable fields and
          are also located in the us-west1 region or the global location.

     --scope=SCOPE
        A scope can be a project, a folder, or an organization. The search is
        limited to the Cloud resources within this scope. The caller must be
        granted the cloudasset.assets.searchAllResources permission on the
        desired scope. If not specified, the configured project property
        (https://cloud.google.com//sdk/docs/configurations#setting_configuration_properties)
        will be used. To find the configured project, run: gcloud config
        get-value project. To change the setting, run: gcloud config set
        project PROJECT_ID.

        The allowed values are:

        * projects/{PROJECT_ID} (e.g., projects/foo-bar)
        * projects/{PROJECT_NUMBER} (e.g., projects/12345678)
        * folders/{FOLDER_NUMBER} (e.g., folders/1234567)
        * organizations/{ORGANIZATION_NUMBER} (e.g. organizations/123456)

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To search all the Cloud resources whose full resource names contain the xyz
    substring, within organizations/123456, ensure the caller has been granted
    the cloudasset.assets.searchAllResources permission on the organization and
    run:

        $ gcloud beta asset search-all-resources \
            --scope='organizations/123456' --query='name:*xyz*'

NOTES
    This command is currently in BETA and may change without notice. This
    variant is also available:

        $ gcloud asset search-all-resources
