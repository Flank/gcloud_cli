NAME
    gcloud beta asset search-all-resources - searches all the resources under a
        given scope (i.e., an organization, a folder, or a project) with
        cloudasset.assets.searchAllResources permission

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta asset search-all-resources [--asset-types=[ASSET_TYPES,...]]
        [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE] [--page-token=PAGE_TOKEN] [--query=QUERY]
        [--scope=SCOPE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Searches all the resources under a given scope (i.e., an
    organization, a folder, or a project) with
    cloudasset.assets.searchAllResources permission.

FLAGS
     --asset-types=[ASSET_TYPES,...]
        A list of asset types (i.e., "compute.googleapis.com/Disk") to search
        of. If specified and non-empty, only resources matching the specified
        types will be returned. If empty, it will search all the supported
        asset types. See
        https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/cloud-asset-inventory/overview
        for supported asset types.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        The page size for search result pagination. The number of matching
        results may be fewer than requested based on the query. The maximum
        page size is 2000. If page-size is not given the backend will pick an
        appropriate default page size.

     --page-token=PAGE_TOKEN
        If present, retrieve the next batch of results from the preceding call
        to this method. page_token must be the value of next_page_token from
        the previous response. The values of all other method parameters must
        be identical to those in the previous call.

     --query=QUERY
        The query statement.

        Examples:
        * To find all Cloud resources with "foobar" in their searchable
          attributes: foobar
        * To find all Cloud resources with "foo" prefix in their searchable
          attributes: foo
        * To find all Cloud resources with "oo" substring within any
          searchable attribute: oo
        * To find all Cloud resources with token "//xyz/123" in the full
          resource name. See Full Resource Names
          (https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names#full_resource_name):
          name: "//xyz/123"
        * To find all Cloud resources with prefix "//xyz" in the full
          resource names. name: "//xyz"
        * To find all Cloud resources with substring "xyz" in the full
          resource names. name: "xyz"
        * To find all Cloud resources with "xyz" in their display name:
          displayName: "xyz"
        * To find all Cloud resources with "xyz" in their description:
          description: "xyz"

     --scope=SCOPE
        The search result scope is limited within a project, folder, or
        organization. You must have the cloudasset.assets.searchAllResources
        permission granted to the caller for the desired scope. The allowed
        value must be one of the following:
        * Organization number (i.e. "organizations/123")
        * Folder number(i.e. "folders/1234")
        * Project number (i.e. "projects/12345")
    If not specified, it will use your configured project in $ gcloud config
    list project. You can change this setting by running $ gcloud config set
    project PROJECT_ID.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
