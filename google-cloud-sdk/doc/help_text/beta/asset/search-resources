NAME
    gcloud beta asset search-resources - searches accessible resources that
        match a query

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta asset search-resources [--asset-types=[ASSET_TYPES,...]]
        [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE] [--page-token=PAGE_TOKEN] [--query=QUERY]
        [--scope=SCOPE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Searches accessible resources that match a query.

FLAGS
     --asset-types=[ASSET_TYPES,...]
        A list of asset types (i.e., "compute.googleapis.com/Disk") to search
        of. If specified and non-empty, only resources matching the specified
        types will be returned. If empty, it will search all the supported
        asset types. See
        https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/cloud-asset-inventory/overview
        for supported asset types.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        The page size for search result pagination. The number of matching
        results may be fewer than requested based on the query. The maximum
        page size is 2000. If page-size is not given the backend will pick an
        appropriate default page size.

     --page-token=PAGE_TOKEN
        If present, retrieve the next batch of results from the preceding call
        to this method. page_token must be the value of next_page_token from
        the previous response. The values of all other method parameters must
        be identical to those in the previous call.

     --query=QUERY
        The query statement. To learn how to construct a query, see
        https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/searching-resources#how_to_construct_a_query.

        Examples:
        * To find Google Cloud resources with "foobar" in their searchable
          attributes: foobar
        * To find Google Cloud resources with "foo" prefix in their
          searchable attributes: foo*
        * To find Google Cloud resources with "oo" substring within any
          searchable attribute: *oo*
        * To find Google Cloud resources with token "//xyz/123" in the full
          resource name: name : "//xyz/123"
        * To find Google Cloud resources with prefix "//xyz" in the full
          resource names: name : "//xyz*"
        * To find Google Cloud resources with substring "xyz" in the full
          resource names: name : "*xyz*"
        * To find Google Cloud resources with "xyz" in their display name:
          displayName : "xyz"
        * To find Google Cloud resources with "xyz" in their description:
          description : "xyz"

     --scope=SCOPE
        The search is limited to the resources within the scope. The allowed
        value must be one of the following:
        * Organization number (i.e. "organizations/123")
        * Folder number(i.e. "folders/1234")
        * Project number (i.e. "projects/12345")
    If not specified, it will use your configured project in $ gcloud config
    list project. You can change this setting by running $ gcloud config set
    project PROJECT_ID.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
