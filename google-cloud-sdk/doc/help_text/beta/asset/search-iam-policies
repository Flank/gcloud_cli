SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta asset search-iam-policies [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE]
        [--page-token=PAGE_TOKEN] [--query=QUERY] [--scope=SCOPE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Searches accessible IAM policies that match a query.

FLAGS
     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        The page size for search result pagination. The number of matching
        results may be fewer than requested based on the query. The maximum
        page size is 2000. If page-size is not given the back end will pick an
        appropriate default page size.

     --page-token=PAGE_TOKEN
        If present, retrieve the next batch of results from the preceding call
        to this method. page_token must be the value of next_page_token from
        the previous response. The values of all other method parameters must
        be identical to those in the previous call.

     --query=QUERY
        The query statement. To learn how to construct a query, see
        https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/searching-iam-policies#how_to_construct_a_query.

        Examples:
        * To find Cloud IAM policy bindings in your organization that contain
          amy@mycompany.com: policy : "amy@mydomain.com"
        * To find Cloud IAM policy bindings in your organization that contain
          the Owner role: policy : "roles/owner"
        * To find Cloud IAM policy bindings in your organization that have
          myuser@mycompany.com in the Owner role: policy : ("roles/owner"
          "myuser@mycompany.com")
        * To find Cloud IAM policy bindings in your organization that have
          myuser@mycompany.com in the Owner role or youruser@mycompany.com in
          the Viewer role: policy : (("roles/owner" "myuser@mycompany.com") OR
          ("roles/viewer" "youruser@mycompany.com"))
        * To find Cloud IAM policy bindings that are set on a resource:
          resource : "projects/123"
        * To find Cloud IAM policy bindings that are set on resources whose
          names contain substring "proj": resource : "*proj*"

     --scope=SCOPE
        The search is limited to the IAM policies within the scope. The allowed
        value must be one of the following:
        * Organization number (i.e. "organizations/123")
        * Folder number(i.e. "folders/1234")
        * Project number (i.e. "projects/12345")
    If not specified, it will use your configured project in $ gcloud config
    list project. You can change this setting by running $ gcloud config set
    project PROJECT_ID.
