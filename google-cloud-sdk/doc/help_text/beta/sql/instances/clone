NAME
    gcloud beta sql instances clone - clones a Cloud SQL instance

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta sql instances clone SOURCE DESTINATION [--async]
        [--bin-log-file-name=BIN_LOG_FILE_NAME]
        [--bin-log-position=BIN_LOG_POSITION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta sql instances clone creates a clone of the Cloud SQL
    instance. The source and the destination instances must be in the same
    project. The clone once created will be an independent Cloud SQL instance.

    The binary log coordinates, if specified, act as the point up to which the
    source instance is cloned. If not specified, the source instance is cloned
    up to the most recent binary log coordinates at the time the command is
    executed.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     SOURCE
        Cloud SQL instance ID of the source.

     DESTINATION
        Cloud SQL instance ID of the clone.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --bin-log-file-name=BIN_LOG_FILE_NAME
        Represents the name of the binary log file created by the source
        instance if it has binary logs enabled. If specified, is the point up
        to which the source instance is cloned. It must be specified along with
        --bin-log-position to form a valid binary log coordinates. e.g.,
        mysql-bin.000001

     --bin-log-position=BIN_LOG_POSITION
        Represents the position (offset) inside the binary log file created by
        the source instance if it has binary logs enabled. If specified, is the
        point up to which the source instance is cloned. It must be specified
        along with --bin-log-file to form a valid binary log coordinates. e.g.,
        123 (a numeric value)

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

EXAMPLES
    To clone a source instance to the most recent binary log coordinates:

        $ gcloud beta sql instances clone instance-foo instance-bar

    or to clone at specific binary log coordinates:

        $ gcloud beta sql instances clone instance-foo instance-bar \
            --bin-log-file-name mysql-bin.000020 --bin-log-position 170

NOTES
    This command is currently in BETA and may change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud sql instances clone
        $ gcloud alpha sql instances clone
