DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Updates the settings of a Cloud SQL instance.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE
        Cloud SQL instance ID.

FLAGS
     --activation-policy=ACTIVATION_POLICY
        The activation policy for this instance. This specifies when the
        instance should be activated and is applicable only when the instance
        state is RUNNABLE. The default is ON_DEMAND. More information on
        activation policies can be found here:
        https://cloud.google.com/sql/faq#activation_policy. ACTIVATION_POLICY
        must be one of: ALWAYS, NEVER, ON_DEMAND.

     --[no-]assign-ip
        The instance must be assigned an IP address. Use --assign-ip to enable
        and --no-assign-ip to disable.

     --async
        Do not wait for the operation to complete.

     --availability-type=AVAILABILITY_TYPE
        Specifies level of availability. Only applies to PSQL instances.
        AVAILABILITY_TYPE must be one of:

         REGIONAL
            Provides high availability and is recommended for production
            instances; instance automatically fails over to another zone within
            your selected region.
         ZONAL
            Provides no failover capability. This is the default.

     --cpu=CPU
        A whole number value indicating how many cores are desired in the
        machine. Both --cpu and --memory must be specified if a custom machine
        type is desired, and the --tier flag must be omitted.

     --diff
        Show what changed as a result of the update.

     --[no-]enable-bin-log
        Specified if binary log should be enabled. If backup configuration is
        disabled, binary log must be disabled as well. Use --enable-bin-log to
        enable and --no-enable-bin-log to disable.

     --[no-]enable-database-replication
        Enable database replication. Applicable only for read replica
        instance(s). WARNING: Instance will be restarted. Use
        --enable-database-replication to enable and
        --no-enable-database-replication to disable.

     --follow-gae-app=FOLLOW_GAE_APP
        First Generation instances only. The App Engine app this instance
        should follow. It must be in the same region as the instance. WARNING:
        Instance may be restarted.

     --gce-zone=GCE_ZONE
        The preferred Compute Engine zone (e.g. us-central1-a, us-central1-b,
        etc.). WARNING: Instance may be restarted.

     --maintenance-release-channel=MAINTENANCE_RELEASE_CHANNEL
        Which channel's updates to apply during the maintenance window. If not
        specified, Cloud SQL chooses the timing of updates to your instance.
        MAINTENANCE_RELEASE_CHANNEL must be one of:

         preview
            Preview updates release prior to production updates. You may wish
            to use the preview channel for dev/test applications so that you
            can preview their compatibility with your application prior to the
            production release.
         production
            Production updates are stable and recommended for applications in
            production.

     --maintenance-window-any
        Removes the user-specified maintenance window.

     --maintenance-window-day=MAINTENANCE_WINDOW_DAY
        Day of week for maintenance window, in UTC time zone.
        MAINTENANCE_WINDOW_DAY must be one of: SUN, MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI,
        SAT.

     --maintenance-window-hour=MAINTENANCE_WINDOW_HOUR
        Hour of day for maintenance window, in UTC time zone.

     --memory=MEMORY
        A whole number value indicating how much memory is desired in the
        machine. A size unit should be provided (eg. 3072MiB or 9GiB) - if no
        units are specified, GiB is assumed. Both --cpu and --memory must be
        specified if a custom machine type is desired, and the --tier flag must
        be omitted.

     --pricing-plan=PRICING_PLAN, -p PRICING_PLAN
        First Generation instances only. The pricing plan for this instance.
        PRICING_PLAN must be one of: PER_USE, PACKAGE.

     --replication=REPLICATION
        The type of replication this instance uses. The default is SYNCHRONOUS.
        REPLICATION must be one of: SYNCHRONOUS, ASYNCHRONOUS.

     --[no-]require-ssl
        mysqld should default to 'REQUIRE X509' for users connecting over IP.
        Use --require-ssl to enable and --no-require-ssl to disable.

     --storage-auto-increase
        Storage size can be increased, but it cannot be decreased; storage
        increases are permanent for the life of the instance. With this setting
        enabled, a spike in storage requirements can result in permanently
        increased storage costs for your instance. However, if an instance runs
        out of available space, it can result in the instance going offline,
        dropping existing connections. This setting is enabled by default.

     --storage-auto-increase-limit=STORAGE_AUTO_INCREASE_LIMIT
        Allows you to set a maximum storage capacity, in GB. Automatic
        increases to your capacity will stop once this limit has been reached.
        Default capacity is unlimited.

     --storage-size=STORAGE_SIZE
        Amount of storage allocated to the instance. Must be an integer number
        of GB between 10GB and 10230GB inclusive. The default is 10GB.

     --tier=TIER, -t TIER
        The tier for this instance. For Second Generation instances, TIER is
        the instance's machine type (e.g., db-n1-standard-1). For PostgreSQL
        instances, only shared-core machine types (e.g., db-f1-micro) apply. A
        complete list of tiers is available here:
        https://cloud.google.com/sql/pricing. WARNING: Instance will be
        restarted.

     --update-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        A list of label KEY=VALUE pairs to update. If a label exists its value
        is modified, otherwise a new label is created.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --authorized-gae-apps=APP,[APP,...]
          First Generation instances only. List of IDs for App Engine
          applications running in the Standard environment that can access this
          instance.

       --clear-gae-apps
          Specified to clear the list of App Engine apps that can access this
          instance.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --authorized-networks=NETWORK,[NETWORK,...]
          The list of external networks that are allowed to connect to the
          instance. Specified in CIDR notation, also known as 'slash' notation
          (e.g. 192.168.100.0/24).

       --clear-authorized-networks
          Clear the list of external networks that are allowed to connect to
          the instance.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --clear-database-flags
          Clear the database flags set on the instance. WARNING: Instance will
          be restarted.

       --database-flags=FLAG=VALUE,[FLAG=VALUE,...]
          A comma-separated list of database flags to set on the instance. Use
          an equals sign to separate flag name and value. Flags without values,
          like skip_grant_tables, can be written out without a value after,
          e.g., skip_grant_tables=. Use on/off for booleans. View the Instance
          Resource API for allowed flags. (e.g., --database-flags
          max_allowed_packet=55555,skip_grant_tables=,log_output=1)

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --clear-labels
          Removes all labels. If --update-labels is also specified then
          --clear-labels is applied first.

          For example, to remove all labels:

              $ gcloud beta sql instances patch --clear-labels

          To set the labels to exactly "foo" and "baz":

              $ gcloud beta sql instances patch --clear-labels \
                --update-labels foo=bar,baz=qux

       --remove-labels=[KEY,...]
          A list of label keys to remove. If a label does not exist it is
          silently ignored.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --no-backup
          Specified if daily backup should be disabled.

       --backup-start-time=BACKUP_START_TIME
          The start time of daily backups, specified in the 24 hour format -
          HH:MM, in the UTC timezone.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

    This command is currently in BETA and may change without notice. This
    variant is also available:
