DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Updates the settings of a Cloud SQL instance.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE
        Cloud SQL instance ID.

FLAGS
     --activation-policy=ACTIVATION_POLICY
        Activation policy for this instance. This specifies when the instance
        should be activated and is applicable only when the instance state is
        RUNNABLE. The default is on-demand. More information on activation
        policies can be found here:
        https://cloud.google.com/sql/faq#activation_policy. ACTIVATION_POLICY
        must be one of: always, never, on-demand.

     --[no-]assign-ip
        Assign a public IP address to the instance. This is a public,
        externally available IPv4 address that you can use to connect to your
        instance when properly authorized. Use --assign-ip to enable a public
        IP and --no-assign-ip to disable it. Use --assign-ip to enable and
        --no-assign-ip to disable.

     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --availability-type=AVAILABILITY_TYPE
        Specifies level of availability. AVAILABILITY_TYPE must be one of:

         regional
            Provides high availability and is recommended for production
            instances; instance automatically fails over to another zone within
            your selected region.
         zonal
            Provides no failover capability. This is the default.

     --cpu=CPU
        Whole number value indicating how many cores are desired in the
        machine. Both --cpu and --memory must be specified if a custom machine
        type is desired, and the --tier flag must be omitted.

     --diff
        Show what changed as a result of the update.

     --[no-]enable-bin-log
        Allows for data recovery from a specific point in time, down to a
        fraction of a second. Must have automatic backups enabled to use. Make
        sure storage can support at least 7 days of logs. Use --enable-bin-log
        to enable and --no-enable-bin-log to disable.

     --[no-]enable-database-replication
        Enable database replication. Applicable only for read replica
        instance(s). WARNING: Instance will be restarted. Use
        --enable-database-replication to enable and
        --no-enable-database-replication to disable.

     --enable-point-in-time-recovery
        Allows for data recovery from a specific point in time, down to a
        fraction of a second, via write-ahead logs. Must have automatic backups
        enabled to use. Make sure storage can support at least 7 days of logs.

     --follow-gae-app=FOLLOW_GAE_APP
        First Generation instances only. The App Engine app this instance
        should follow. It must be in the same region as the instance. WARNING:
        Instance may be restarted.

     --maintenance-release-channel=MAINTENANCE_RELEASE_CHANNEL
        Which channel's updates to apply during the maintenance window. If not
        specified, Cloud SQL chooses the timing of updates to your instance.
        MAINTENANCE_RELEASE_CHANNEL must be one of:

         preview
            Preview updates release prior to production updates. You may wish
            to use the preview channel for dev/test applications so that you
            can preview their compatibility with your application prior to the
            production release.
         production
            Production updates are stable and recommended for applications in
            production.

     --maintenance-window-any
        Removes the user-specified maintenance window.

     --maintenance-window-day=MAINTENANCE_WINDOW_DAY
        Day of week for maintenance window, in UTC time zone.
        MAINTENANCE_WINDOW_DAY must be one of: SUN, MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI,
        SAT.

     --maintenance-window-hour=MAINTENANCE_WINDOW_HOUR
        Hour of day for maintenance window, in UTC time zone.

     --memory=MEMORY
        Whole number value indicating how much memory is desired in the
        machine. A size unit should be provided (eg. 3072MiB or 9GiB) - if no
        units are specified, GiB is assumed. Both --cpu and --memory must be
        specified if a custom machine type is desired, and the --tier flag must
        be omitted.

     --network=NETWORK
        Network in the current project that the instance will be part of. To
        specify using a network with a shared VPC, use the full URL of the
        network. For an example host project, 'testproject', and shared
        network, 'testsharednetwork', this would be of the
        form:--network=projects/testproject/global/networks/testsharednetwork

     --pricing-plan=PRICING_PLAN, -p PRICING_PLAN
        First Generation instances only. The pricing plan for this instance.
        PRICING_PLAN must be one of: PER_USE, PACKAGE.

     --replication=REPLICATION
        Type of replication this instance uses. The default is synchronous.
        REPLICATION must be one of: synchronous, asynchronous.

     --[no-]require-ssl
        mysqld should default to 'REQUIRE X509' for users connecting over IP.
        Use --require-ssl to enable and --no-require-ssl to disable.

     --storage-auto-increase
        Storage size can be increased, but it cannot be decreased; storage
        increases are permanent for the life of the instance. With this setting
        enabled, a spike in storage requirements can result in permanently
        increased storage costs for your instance. However, if an instance runs
        out of available space, it can result in the instance going offline,
        dropping existing connections. This setting is enabled by default.

     --storage-auto-increase-limit=STORAGE_AUTO_INCREASE_LIMIT
        Allows you to set a maximum storage capacity, in GB. Automatic
        increases to your capacity will stop once this limit has been reached.
        Default capacity is unlimited.

     --storage-size=STORAGE_SIZE
        Amount of storage allocated to the instance. Must be an integer number
        of GB. The default is 10GB. Information on storage limits can be found
        here: https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/quotas#storage_limits

     --tier=TIER, -t TIER
        The tier for this instance. For Second Generation instances, TIER is
        the instance's machine type (e.g., db-n1-standard-1). For PostgreSQL
        instances, only shared-core machine types (e.g., db-f1-micro) apply. A
        complete list of tiers is available here:
        https://cloud.google.com/sql/pricing. WARNING: Instance will be
        restarted.

     --update-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to update. If a label exists its value is
        modified, otherwise a new label is created.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --authorized-gae-apps=APP,[APP,...]
          First Generation instances only. List of project IDs for App Engine
          applications running in the Standard environment that can access this
          instance.

          The value given for this argument replaces the existing list.

       --clear-gae-apps
          Specified to clear the list of App Engine apps that can access this
          instance.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --authorized-networks=NETWORK,[NETWORK,...]
          The list of external networks that are allowed to connect to the
          instance. Specified in CIDR notation, also known as 'slash' notation
          (e.g. 192.168.100.0/24).

          The value given for this argument replaces the existing list.

       --clear-authorized-networks
          Clear the list of external networks that are allowed to connect to
          the instance.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --clear-database-flags
          Clear the database flags set on the instance. WARNING: Instance will
          be restarted.

       --database-flags=FLAG=VALUE,[FLAG=VALUE,...]
          Comma-separated list of database flags to set on the instance. Use an
          equals sign to separate flag name and value. Flags without values,
          like skip_grant_tables, can be written out without a value after,
          e.g., skip_grant_tables=. Use on/off for booleans. View the Instance
          Resource API for allowed flags. (e.g., --database-flags
          max_allowed_packet=55555,skip_grant_tables=,log_output=1)

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --clear-labels
          Remove all labels. If --update-labels is also specified then
          --clear-labels is applied first.

          For example, to remove all labels:

              $ gcloud beta sql instances patch --clear-labels

          To set the labels to exactly "foo" and "baz":

              $ gcloud beta sql instances patch --clear-labels \
                --update-labels foo=bar,baz=qux

       --remove-labels=[KEY,...]
          List of label keys to remove. If a label does not exist it is
          silently ignored. If --update-labels is also specified then
          --remove-labels is applied first.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --gce-zone=GCE_ZONE
          (DEPRECATED) Preferred Compute Engine zone (e.g. us-central1-a,
          us-central1-b, etc.). WARNING: Instance may be restarted.

          Flag --gce-zone is deprecated and will be removed by release 255.0.0.
          Use --zone instead.

       --zone=ZONE
          Preferred Compute Engine zone (e.g. us-central1-a, us-central1-b,
          etc.). WARNING: Instance may be restarted.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --no-backup
          Specified if daily backup should be disabled.

       --backup-location=BACKUP_LOCATION
          Choose where to store your backups. Backups are stored in the closest
          multi-region location to you by default. Only customize if needed.
          Specify empty string to revert to default.

       --backup-start-time=BACKUP_START_TIME
          Start time of daily backups, specified in the 24 hour format - HH:MM,
          in the UTC timezone.
