DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Creates a new Cloud SQL instance.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE
        Cloud SQL instance ID.

FLAGS
     --activation-policy=ACTIVATION_POLICY
        The activation policy for this instance. This specifies when the
        instance should be activated and is applicable only when the instance
        state is RUNNABLE. The default is ON_DEMAND. More information on
        activation policies can be found here:
        https://cloud.google.com/sql/faq#activation_policy. ACTIVATION_POLICY
        must be one of: ALWAYS, NEVER, ON_DEMAND.

     --assign-ip
        The instance must be assigned an IP address.

     --async
        Display information about the operation in progress, without waiting
        for the operation to complete.

     --authorized-gae-apps=APP,[APP,...]
        First Generation instances only. List of IDs for App Engine
        applications running in the Standard environment that can access this
        instance.

     --authorized-networks=NETWORK,[NETWORK,...]
        The list of external networks that are allowed to connect to the
        instance. Specified in CIDR notation, also known as 'slash' notation
        (e.g. 192.168.100.0/24).

     --availability-type=AVAILABILITY_TYPE
        Specifies level of availability. Only applies to PSQL instances.
        AVAILABILITY_TYPE must be one of:

         REGIONAL
            Provides high availability and is recommended for production
            instances; instance automatically fails over to another zone within
            your selected region.
         ZONAL
            Provides no failover capability. This is the default.

     --backup
        Enables daily backup. Enabled by default, use --no-backup to disable.

     --backup-start-time=BACKUP_START_TIME
        The start time of daily backups, specified in the 24 hour format -
        HH:MM, in the UTC timezone.

     --cpu=CPU
        A whole number value indicating how many cores are desired in the
        machine. Both --cpu and --memory must be specified if a custom machine
        type is desired, and the --tier flag must be omitted.

     --database-flags=FLAG=VALUE,[FLAG=VALUE,...]
        A comma-separated list of database flags to set on the instance. Use an
        equals sign to separate flag name and value. Flags without values, like
        skip_grant_tables, can be written out without a value after, e.g.,
        skip_grant_tables=. Use on/off for booleans. View the Instance Resource
        API for allowed flags. (e.g., --database-flags
        max_allowed_packet=55555,skip_grant_tables=,log_output=1)

     --database-version=DATABASE_VERSION; default="MYSQL_5_6"
        The database engine type and version. DATABASE_VERSION must be one of:
        MYSQL_5_5, MYSQL_5_6, MYSQL_5_7, POSTGRES_9_6.

     --enable-bin-log
        Specified if binary log should be enabled. If backup configuration is
        disabled, binary log must be disabled as well.

     --failover-replica-name=FAILOVER_REPLICA_NAME
        Also create a failover replica with the specified name.

     --follow-gae-app=FOLLOW_GAE_APP
        First Generation instances only. The App Engine app this instance
        should follow. It must be in the same region as the instance.

     --gce-zone=GCE_ZONE
        The preferred Compute Engine zone (e.g. us-central1-a, us-central1-b,
        etc.).

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        A list of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

     --maintenance-release-channel=MAINTENANCE_RELEASE_CHANNEL
        Which channel's updates to apply during the maintenance window. If not
        specified, Cloud SQL chooses the timing of updates to your instance.
        MAINTENANCE_RELEASE_CHANNEL must be one of:

         preview
            Preview updates release prior to production updates. You may wish
            to use the preview channel for dev/test applications so that you
            can preview their compatibility with your application prior to the
            production release.
         production
            Production updates are stable and recommended for applications in
            production.

     --maintenance-window-day=MAINTENANCE_WINDOW_DAY
        Day of week for maintenance window, in UTC time zone.
        MAINTENANCE_WINDOW_DAY must be one of: SUN, MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI,
        SAT.

     --maintenance-window-hour=MAINTENANCE_WINDOW_HOUR
        Hour of day for maintenance window, in UTC time zone.

     --master-instance-name=MASTER_INSTANCE_NAME
        Name of the instance which will act as master in the replication setup.
        The newly created instance will be a read replica of the specified
        master instance.

     --memory=MEMORY
        A whole number value indicating how much memory is desired in the
        machine. A size unit should be provided (eg. 3072MiB or 9GiB) - if no
        units are specified, GiB is assumed. Both --cpu and --memory must be
        specified if a custom machine type is desired, and the --tier flag must
        be omitted.

     --pricing-plan=PRICING_PLAN, -p PRICING_PLAN; default="PER_USE"
        First Generation instances only. The pricing plan for this instance.
        PRICING_PLAN must be one of: PER_USE, PACKAGE.

     --region=REGION; default="us-central"
        The regional location (e.g. asia-east1, us-east1). See the full list of
        regions at https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/instance-locations.

     --replica-type=REPLICA_TYPE
        The type of replica to create. REPLICA_TYPE must be one of: READ,
        FAILOVER.

     --replication=REPLICATION
        The type of replication this instance uses. The default is SYNCHRONOUS.
        REPLICATION must be one of: SYNCHRONOUS, ASYNCHRONOUS.

     --require-ssl
        Specified if users connecting over IP must use SSL.

     --storage-auto-increase
        Storage size can be increased, but it cannot be decreased; storage
        increases are permanent for the life of the instance. With this setting
        enabled, a spike in storage requirements can result in permanently
        increased storage costs for your instance. However, if an instance runs
        out of available space, it can result in the instance going offline,
        dropping existing connections. This setting is enabled by default.

     --storage-auto-increase-limit=STORAGE_AUTO_INCREASE_LIMIT
        Allows you to set a maximum storage capacity, in GB. Automatic
        increases to your capacity will stop once this limit has been reached.
        Default capacity is unlimited.

     --storage-size=STORAGE_SIZE
        Amount of storage allocated to the instance. Must be an integer number
        of GB between 10GB and 10230GB inclusive. The default is 10GB.

     --storage-type=STORAGE_TYPE
        The storage type for the instance. The default is SSD. STORAGE_TYPE
        must be one of: SSD, HDD.

     --tier=TIER, -t TIER
        The tier for this instance. For Second Generation instances, TIER is
        the instance's machine type (e.g., db-n1-standard-1). For PostgreSQL
        instances, only shared-core machine types (e.g., db-f1-micro) apply.
        The default tier is db-n1-standard-1. A complete list of tiers is
        available here: https://cloud.google.com/sql/pricing

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.
