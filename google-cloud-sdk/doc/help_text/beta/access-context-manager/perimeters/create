NAME
    gcloud beta access-context-manager perimeters create - create a new service
        perimeter

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta access-context-manager perimeters create
        (PERIMETER : --policy=POLICY) --resources=[RESOURCES,...] --title=TITLE
        [--access-levels=[LEVEL,...]] [--async] [--description=DESCRIPTION]
        [--perimeter-type=PERIMETER_TYPE; default="regular"]
        [--restricted-services=[SERVICE,...]
          | --unrestricted-services=[SERVICE,...]] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Create a new service perimeter in a given access policy.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Perimeter resource - The service perimeter to create. The arguments in
     this group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. This
     must be specified.

       PERIMETER
          ID of the perimeter or fully qualified identifier for the perimeter.
          This positional must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --policy=POLICY
          The ID of the access policy.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --resources=[RESOURCES,...]
        Comma-separated list of resources (currently only projects, in the form
        projects/<projectnumber>) in this perimeter.

     --title=TITLE
        Short human-readable title for the service perimeter.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --access-levels=[LEVEL,...]
        Comma-separated list of IDs for access levels (in the same policy) that
        an intra-perimeter request must satisfy to be allowed.

     --async
        Display information about the operation in progress, without waiting
        for the operation to complete.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Long-form description of service perimeter.

     --perimeter-type=PERIMETER_TYPE; default="regular"
        Type of the perimeter. PERIMETER_TYPE must be one of:

         bridge
            Allows resources in different regular service perimeters to import
            and export data between each other.

            A project may belong to multiple bridge service perimeters (only if
            it also belongs to a regular service perimeter). Both restricted
            and unrestricted service lists, as well as access level lists, must
            be empty.

         regular
            Allows resources within this service perimeter to import and export
            data amongst themselves.

            A project may belong to at most one regular service perimeter.

     For a regular service perimeter, these parameters specify the services to
     which the perimeter boundary applies. Only one may be provided, and the
     other is implicitly provided as a wildcard (*) matching all other
     services. For instance, --restricted-services storage.googleapis.com
     applies the perimeter boundary to the Google Cloud Storage service, but
     not any other services. At most one of these may be specified:

       --restricted-services=[SERVICE,...]
          Comma-separated list of services to which the perimeter boundary does
          apply (for example, storage.googleapis.com).

       --unrestricted-services=[SERVICE,...]
          Comma-separated list of services to which the perimeter boundary does
          not apply (for example, storage.googleapis.com).

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.
