NAME
    gcloud beta kms encrypt - encrypt a plaintext file using a key

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta kms encrypt --ciphertext-file=CIPHERTEXT_FILE
        --plaintext-file=PLAINTEXT_FILE
        [--additional-authenticated-data-file=ADDITIONAL_AUTHENTICATED_DATA_FILE]
        [--key=KEY] [--keyring=KEYRING] [--location=LOCATION]
        [--version=VERSION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Encrypts the given plaintext file using the given CryptoKey and
    writes the result to the named ciphertext file. The plaintext file must not
    be larger than 64KiB.

    If an additional authenticated data file is provided, its contents must
    also be provided during decryption. The file must not be larger than 64KiB.

    The flag --version indicates the version of the key to use for encryption.
    By default, the primary version is used.

    If --plaintext-file or --additional-authenticated-data-file is set to '-',
    that file is read from stdin. Similarly, if --ciphertext-file is set to
    '-', the ciphertext is written to stdout.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --ciphertext-file=CIPHERTEXT_FILE
        Path to the ciphertext file to output.

     --plaintext-file=PLAINTEXT_FILE
        Path to the plaintext file to encrypt.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --additional-authenticated-data-file=ADDITIONAL_AUTHENTICATED_DATA_FILE
        Path to the optional file containing the additional authenticated data.

     --key=KEY
        The key to use for encryption.

     --keyring=KEYRING
        The containing keyring.

     --location=LOCATION
        The location of the requested resource.

     --version=VERSION
        The version to use for encryption.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    The following command will read the file 'path/to/plaintext', encrypt it
    using the CryptoKey frodo with the KeyRing fellowship and Location global,
    and write the ciphertext to 'path/to/ciphertext'.

        $ gcloud beta kms encrypt \
            --key frodo \
            --keyring fellowship \
            --location global \
            --plaintext-file path/to/input/plaintext \
            --ciphertext-file path/to/output/ciphertext

NOTES
    This command is currently in BETA and may change without notice. This
    variant is also available:

        $ gcloud kms encrypt
