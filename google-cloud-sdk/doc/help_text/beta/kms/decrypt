NAME
    gcloud beta kms decrypt - decrypt a ciphertext file using a Cloud KMS key

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta kms decrypt --ciphertext-file=CIPHERTEXT_FILE
        --plaintext-file=PLAINTEXT_FILE
        [--additional-authenticated-data-file=ADDITIONAL_AUTHENTICATED_DATA_FILE]
        [--key=KEY] [--keyring=KEYRING] [--location=LOCATION]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta kms decrypt decrypts the given ciphertext file using the
    given Cloud KMS key and writes the result to the named plaintext file. Note
    that to permit users to decrypt using a key, they must be have at least one
    of the following IAM roles for that key: roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyDecrypter,
    roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter.

    Additional authenticated data (AAD) is used as an additional check by Cloud
    KMS to authenticate a decryption request. If an additional authenticated
    data file is provided, its contents must match the additional authenticated
    data provided during encryption and must not be larger than 64KiB. If you
    don't provide a value for --additional-authenticated-data-file, an empty
    string is used. For a thorough explanation of AAD, refer to this guide:
    https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/additional-authenticated-data

    If --ciphertext-file or --additional-authenticated-data-file is set to '-',
    that file is read from stdin. Note that both files cannot be read from
    stdin. Similarly, if --plaintext-file is set to '-', the decrypted
    plaintext is written to stdout.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --ciphertext-file=CIPHERTEXT_FILE
        File path of the ciphertext file to decrypt.

     --plaintext-file=PLAINTEXT_FILE
        File path of the plaintext file to output.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --additional-authenticated-data-file=ADDITIONAL_AUTHENTICATED_DATA_FILE
        File path to the optional file containing the additional authenticated
        data.

     --key=KEY
        Cloud KMS key to use for decryption.

     --keyring=KEYRING
        Key ring of the key.

     --location=LOCATION
        Location of the keyring.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To decrypt the file 'path/to/ciphertext' using the key frodo with key ring
    fellowship and location global and write the plaintext to
    'path/to/plaintext.dec', run:

        $ gcloud beta kms decrypt \
            --key=frodo \
            --keyring=fellowship \
            --location=global \
            --ciphertext-file=path/to/input/ciphertext \
            --plaintext-file=path/to/output/plaintext.dec

    To decrypt the file 'path/to/ciphertext' using the key frodo and the
    additional authenticated data that was used to encrypt the ciphertext, and
    write the decrypted plaintext to stdout, run:

        $ gcloud beta kms decrypt \
            --key=frodo \
            --keyring=fellowship \
            --location=global \
            --additional-authenticated-data-file=path/to/aad \
            --ciphertext-file=path/to/input/ciphertext \
            --plaintext-file='-'

NOTES
    This command is currently in BETA and may change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud kms decrypt
        $ gcloud alpha kms decrypt
