NAME
    gcloud beta ml-engine predict - run Cloud ML Engine online prediction

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta ml-engine predict --model=MODEL
        (--json-instances=JSON_INSTANCES | --text-instances=TEXT_INSTANCES)
        [--version=VERSION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta ml-engine predict sends a prediction request to Cloud ML
    Engine for the given instances. This command will read up to 100 instances,
    though the service itself will accept instances up to the payload limit
    size (currently, 1.5MB). If you are predicting on more instances, you
    should use batch prediction via

        $ gcloud beta ml-engine jobs submit prediction.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --model=MODEL
        Name of the model.

     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --json-instances=JSON_INSTANCES
          Path to a local file from which instances are read. Instances are in
          JSON format; newline delimited.

          An example of the JSON instances file:

              {"images": [0.0, ..., 0.1], "key": 3}
              {"images": [0.0, ..., 0.1], "key": 2}
              ...

          This flag accepts "-" for stdin.

       --text-instances=TEXT_INSTANCES
          Path to a local file from which instances are read. Instances are in
          UTF-8 encoded text format; newline delimited.

          An example of the text instances file:

              107,4.9,2.5,4.5,1.7
              100,5.7,2.8,4.1,1.3
              ...

          This flag accepts "-" for stdin.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --version=VERSION
        Model version to be used.

        If unspecified, the default version of the model will be used. To list
        model versions run

            $ gcloud beta ml-engine versions list

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in BETA and may change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud ml-engine predict
        $ gcloud alpha ml-engine predict
