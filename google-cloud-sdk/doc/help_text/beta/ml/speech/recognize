DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Get a transcript of an audio file that is less than 60 seconds. You
    can use an audio file that is on your local drive or a Google Cloud Storage
    URL.

    If the audio is longer than 60 seconds, you will get an error. Please use
    gcloud beta ml speech recognize-long-running instead.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     AUDIO
        The location of the audio file to transcribe. Must be a local path or a
        Google Cloud Storage URL (in the format gs://bucket/object).

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --language-code=LANGUAGE_CODE
        The language of the supplied audio as a BCP-47
        (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt) language tag. Example:
        "en-US". See https://cloud.google.com/speech/docs/languages for a list
        of the currently supported language codes.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --additional-language-codes=[LANGUAGE_CODE,...]
        The BCP-47 language tags of other languages that the speech may be in.
        Up to 3 can be provided.

        If alternative languages are listed, recognition result will contain
        recognition in the most likely language detected including the main
        language-code.

     --encoding=ENCODING; default="encoding-unspecified"
        The type of encoding of the file. Required if the file format is not
        WAV or FLAC. ENCODING must be one of: amr, amr-wb,
        encoding-unspecified, flac, linear16, mp3, mulaw, ogg-opus,
        speex-with-header-byte.

     --filter-profanity
        If True, the server will attempt to filter out profanities, replacing
        all but the initial character in each filtered word with asterisks,
        e.g. \"f**\".

     --hints=[HINTS,...]
        A list of strings containing word and phrase "hints" so that the speech
        recognition is more likely to recognize them. This can be used to
        improve the accuracy for specific words and phrases, for example, if
        specific commands are typically spoken by the user. This can also be
        used to add additional words to the vocabulary of the recognizer. See
        https://cloud.google.com/speech/limits#content.

     --include-word-confidence
        Include a list of words and the confidence for those words in the top
        result.

     --include-word-time-offsets
        If True, the top result includes a list of words with the start and end
        time offsets (timestamps) for those words. If False, no word-level time
        offset information is returned.

     --max-alternatives=MAX_ALTERNATIVES; default=1
        Maximum number of recognition hypotheses to be returned. The server may
        return fewer than max_alternatives. Valid values are 0-30. A value of 0
        or 1 will return a maximum of one.

     --sample-rate=SAMPLE_RATE
        The sample rate in Hertz. For best results, set the sampling rate of
        the audio source to 16000 Hz. If that's not possible, use the native
        sample rate of the audio source (instead of re-sampling).

     --enable-speaker-diarization
        Enable speaker detection for each recognized word in the top
        alternative of the recognition result using an integer speaker_tag
        provided in the WordInfo.

     --diarization-speaker-count=DIARIZATION_SPEAKER_COUNT
        Estimated number of speakers in the conversation being recognized.
