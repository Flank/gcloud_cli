NAME
    gcloud beta app instances scp - SCP from or to the VM of an App Engine
        Flexible instance

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta app instances scp [INSTANCE:]SRC [[INSTANCE:]SRC ...]
        [INSTANCE:]DEST [--compress] [--recurse] [--service=SERVICE]
        [--version=VERSION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta app instances scp lets you remotely copy files to or
    from an App Engine Flexible instance.

    gcloud beta app instances scp resolves the instance's IP address and
    pre-populates the VM with a public key managed by gcloud. If the gcloud
    managed key pair does not exist, it is generated the first time an SSH
    command is run, which may prompt you for a passphrase for the private key
    encryption.

    All SSH commands require the OpenSSH client suite to be installed on Linux
    and Mac OS X. On Windows, the Cloud SDK comes with a bundled PuTTY suite
    instead, so it has no external dependencies.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     [INSTANCE:]SRC [[INSTANCE:]SRC ...]
        Specifies the files to copy.

     [INSTANCE:]DEST
        Specifies a destination for the source files.

FLAGS
     --compress
        Enable compression.

     --recurse
        Upload directories recursively.

     --service=SERVICE
        The service ID.

     --version=VERSION
        The version ID.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,

    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,

        $ gcloud beta app instances scp --service s1 --version v1 \
          i1:remote_file local_file

    To copy several local files to a remote instance, run:

        $ gcloud beta app instances scp --service s1 --version v1 local_1 \
          local_1 i1:remote_dir

    To use recursive copy, run:

        $ gcloud beta app instances scp --service s1 --version v1 \
          --recurse local_dir i1:remote_dir
