DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Beta versions of gcloud commands.

GLOBAL FLAGS
     --account=ACCOUNT
        Google Cloud Platform user account to use for invocation. Overrides the
        default core/account property value for this command invocation.

     --configuration=CONFIGURATION
        The configuration to use for this command invocation. For more
        information on how to use configurations, run: gcloud topic
        configurations. You can also use the [CLOUDSDK_ACTIVE_CONFIG_NAME]
        environment variable to set the equivalent of this flag for a terminal
        session.

     --flatten=[KEY,...]
        Flatten name[] output resource slices in KEY into separate records for
        each item in each slice. Multiple keys and slices may be specified.
        This also flattens keys for --format and --filter. For example,
        --flatten=abc.def flattens abc.def[].ghi references to abc.def.ghi. A
        resource record containing abc.def[] with N elements will expand to N
        records in the flattened output. This flag interacts with other flags
        that are applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter,
        --limit.

     --format=FORMAT
        Sets the format for printing command output resources. The default is a
        command-specific human-friendly output format. The supported formats
        are: config, csv, default, diff, disable, flattened, get, json, list,
        multi, none, object, table, text, value, yaml. For more details run $
        gcloud topic formats.

     --help
        Display detailed help.

     --project=PROJECT_ID
        The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
        omitted, then the current project is assumed; the current project can
        be listed using gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)' and
        can be set using gcloud config set project PROJECTID. Overrides the
        default core/project property value for this command invocation.

     --quiet, -q
        Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
        is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.
        Overrides the default core/disable_prompts property value for this
        command invocation. Must be used at the beginning of commands. This is
        equivalent to setting the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_CORE_DISABLE_PROMPTS to 1.

     --verbosity=VERBOSITY; default="warning"
        Override the default verbosity for this command with any of the
        supported standard verbosity levels: debug, info, warning, error, and
        none. Overrides the default core/verbosity property value for this
        command invocation.

     --version, -v
        Print version information and exit. This flag is only available at the
        global level.

     -h
        Print a summary help and exit.

OTHER FLAGS
     --log-http
        Log all HTTP server requests and responses to stderr. Overrides the
        default core/log_http property value for this command invocation.

     --trace-token=TRACE_TOKEN
        Token used to route traces of service requests for investigation of
        issues. Overrides the default core/trace_token property value for this
        command invocation.

     --user-output-enabled
        Print user intended output to the console. Overrides the default
        core/user_output_enabled property value for this command invocation.
        Use --no-user-output-enabled to disable.
