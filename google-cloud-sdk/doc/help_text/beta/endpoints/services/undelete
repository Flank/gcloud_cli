NAME
    gcloud beta endpoints services undelete - undeletes a service configuration
        that was previously deleted

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta endpoints services undelete SERVICE [--async]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Services that are deleted will be retained in the system for 30
    days. If a deleted service is still within this retention window, it can be
    undeleted with this command.

    Note that this means that this command will not be effective for service
    configurations marked for deletion more than 30 days ago.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     SERVICE
        The name of the service to undelete.

FLAGS
     --async
        Display information about the operation in progress, without waiting
        for the operation to complete.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To undelete a service named my-service, run:

        $ gcloud beta endpoints services undelete my-service

    To run the same command asynchronously (non-blocking), run:

        $ gcloud beta endpoints services undelete my-service --async

NOTES
    This command is currently in BETA and may change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud endpoints services undelete
        $ gcloud alpha endpoints services undelete
