DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Update a worker pool used by Google Cloud Build.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       Command-line flags to configure the WorkerPool:

         WORKER_POOL
            The unique identifier for the custom worker pool to update. This
            value should be 1-63 characters, and valid characters are
            [a-z][0-9]- This positional must be specified if any of the other
            arguments in this group are specified.

         --peered-network=PEERED_NETWORK
            VPC network to which workers are peered.

            If not specified, the workers are not peered to any network.

         Configuration to be used for creating workers in the WorkerPool:

           --worker-disk-size=WORKER_DISK_SIZE
              Size of the disk attached to the worker.

              If not given, Cloud Build will use a standard disk size.

           --worker-machine-type=WORKER_MACHINE_TYPE
              Compute Engine machine type for a worker pool.

              For information on supported machine types, see
              https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/custom-workers/worker-pool-config-file.

              If unspecified, Cloud Build uses a standard machine type.

       --config-from-file=CONFIG_FROM_FILE
          A file that contains updates to the configuration for the WorkerPool.
