NAME
    gcloud beta dataproc jobs set-iam-policy - set IAM policy for a job

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta dataproc jobs set-iam-policy JOB POLICY_FILE [--region=REGION]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Sets the IAM policy for a job, given a job ID and the policy.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     JOB
        The ID of the job to set the policy on.

     POLICY_FILE
        Path to a local JSON or YAML formatted file containing a valid policy.

        The output of the get-iam-policy command is a valid file, as is any
        JSON or YAML file conforming to the structure of a Policy
        (https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/Policy).

FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        Cloud Dataproc region to use. Each Cloud Dataproc region constitutes an
        independent resource namespace constrained to deploying instances into
        Compute Engine zones inside the region. The default value of global is
        a special multi-region namespace which is capable of deploying
        instances into all Compute Engine zones globally, and is disjoint from
        other Cloud Dataproc regions. Overrides the default dataproc/region
        property value for this command invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

EXAMPLES
    The following command will read an IAM policy defined in a JSON file
    'policy.json' and set it for a job with identifier 'example-job'

        $ gcloud beta dataproc jobs set-iam-policy example-job policy.json

    See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details of the
    policy file format and contents.

NOTES
    This command is currently in BETA and may change without notice. This
    variant is also available:

        $ gcloud dataproc jobs set-iam-policy
