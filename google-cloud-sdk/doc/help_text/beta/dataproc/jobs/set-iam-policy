NAME
    gcloud beta dataproc jobs set-iam-policy - set IAM policy for a job

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta dataproc jobs set-iam-policy (JOB : --region=REGION)
        POLICY_FILE [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Sets the IAM policy for a job, given a job ID and the policy.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Job resource - The ID of the job to set the policy on. The arguments in
     this group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE)
     Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in
     other ways. To set the [project] attribute: provide the argument [job] on
     the command line with a fully specified name; provide the argument
     [--project] on the command line; set the property [core/project]. This
     must be specified.

       JOB
          ID of the job or fully qualified identifier for the job. This
          positional must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
          group are specified.

       --region=REGION
          Cloud Dataproc region for the job. Each Cloud Dataproc region
          constitutes an independent resource namespace constrained to
          deploying instances into Google Compute Engine zones inside the
          region. The default value of global is a special multi-region
          namespace which is capable of deploying instances into all Google
          Compute Engine zones globally, and is disjoint from other Cloud
          Dataproc regions. Overrides the default dataproc/region property
          value for this command invocation.

     POLICY_FILE
        Path to a local JSON or YAML formatted file containing a valid policy.

        The output of the get-iam-policy command is a valid file, as is any
        JSON or YAML file conforming to the structure of a Policy
        (https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/Policy).
