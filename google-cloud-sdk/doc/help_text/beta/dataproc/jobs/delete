NAME
    gcloud beta dataproc jobs delete - delete the record of an inactive job

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta dataproc jobs delete JOB [--region=REGION]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Delete the record of an inactive job.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     JOB
        The ID of the job to delete.

FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        Cloud Dataproc region to use. Each Cloud Dataproc region constitutes an
        independent resource namespace constrained to deploying instances into
        Compute Engine zones inside the region. The default value of global is
        a special multi-region namespace which is capable of deploying
        instances into all Compute Engine zones globally, and is disjoint from
        other Cloud Dataproc regions. Overrides the default dataproc/region
        property value for this command invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

EXAMPLES
    To delete the record of a job, run:

        $ gcloud beta dataproc jobs delete job_id

NOTES
    This command is currently in BETA and may change without notice. This
    variant is also available:

        $ gcloud dataproc jobs delete
