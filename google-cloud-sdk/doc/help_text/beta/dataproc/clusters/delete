NAME
    gcloud beta dataproc clusters delete - delete a cluster

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta dataproc clusters delete (CLUSTER : --region=REGION) [--async]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Delete a cluster.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Cluster resource - The name of the cluster to delete. The arguments in
     this group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE)
     Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in
     other ways. To set the [project] attribute: provide the argument [cluster]
     on the command line with a fully specified name; provide the argument
     [--project] on the command line; set the property [core/project]. This
     must be specified.

       CLUSTER
          ID of the cluster or fully qualified identifier for the cluster. This
          positional must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
          group are specified.

       --region=REGION
          Cloud Dataproc region for the cluster. Each Cloud Dataproc region
          constitutes an independent resource namespace constrained to
          deploying instances into Google Compute Engine zones inside the
          region. The default value of global is a special multi-region
          namespace which is capable of deploying instances into all Google
          Compute Engine zones globally, and is disjoint from other Cloud
          Dataproc regions. Overrides the default dataproc/region property
          value for this command invocation.

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
