NAME
    gcloud beta dataproc - create and manage Google Cloud Dataproc clusters and
        jobs

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta dataproc GROUP [--region=REGION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) The gcloud dataproc command group lets you create and manage Google
    Cloud Dataproc clusters and jobs.

    Cloud Dataproc is an Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, Apache Pig, and Apache
    Hive service. It easily processes big datasets at low cost, creating
    managed clusters of any size that scale down once processing is complete.

    More information on Cloud Dataproc can be found here:
    https://cloud.google.com/dataproc and detailed documentation can be found
    here: https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/

EXAMPLES
    To see how to create and manage clusters, run:

        $ gcloud beta dataproc clusters

    To see how to submit and manage jobs, run:

        $ gcloud beta dataproc jobs

FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        Specifies the Cloud Dataproc region to use. Each Cloud Dataproc region
        constitutes an independent resource namespace constrained to deploying
        instances into Google Compute Engine zones inside the region. The
        default value of "global" is a special multi-region namespace which is
        capable of deploying instances into all Google Compute Engine zones
        globally, and is disjoint from other Cloud Dataproc regions. Overrides
        the default dataproc/region property value for this command invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.
