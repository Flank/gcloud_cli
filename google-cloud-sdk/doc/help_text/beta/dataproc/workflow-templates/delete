    gcloud beta dataproc workflow-templates delete - delete a workflow template

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta dataproc workflow-templates delete TEMPLATE [--region=REGION]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Delete a workflow template.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     TEMPLATE
        The ID of the workflow template to delete.

FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        Specifies the Cloud Dataproc region to use. Each Cloud Dataproc region
        constitutes an independent resource namespace constrained to deploying
        instances into Google Compute Engine zones inside the region. The
        default value of "global" is a special multi-region namespace which is
        capable of deploying instances into all Google Compute Engine zones
        globally, and is disjoint from other Cloud Dataproc regions. Overrides
        the default dataproc/region property value for this command invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in BETA and may change without notice.
