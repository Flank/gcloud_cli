NAME
    gcloud beta dataproc operations set-iam-policy - set IAM policy for an
        operation

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta dataproc operations set-iam-policy OPERATION POLICY_FILE
        [--region=REGION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Sets the IAM policy for an operation, given an operation ID and the
    policy.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     OPERATION
        The ID of the operation to set the policy on.

     POLICY_FILE
        Path to a local JSON or YAML formatted file containing a valid policy.

FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        Specifies the Cloud Dataproc region to use. Each Cloud Dataproc region
        constitutes an independent resource namespace constrained to deploying
        instances into Google Compute Engine zones inside the region. The
        default value of "global" is a special multi-region namespace which is
        capable of deploying instances into all Google Compute Engine zones
        globally, and is disjoint from other Cloud Dataproc regions. Overrides
        the default dataproc/region property value for this command invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    The following command will read an IAM policy defined in a JSON file
    'policy.json' and set it for an operation with identifier
    'example-operation'

        $ gcloud beta dataproc operations set-iam-policy example-operation \
            policy.json

    See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details of the
    policy file format and contents.

NOTES
    This command is currently in BETA and may change without notice.
