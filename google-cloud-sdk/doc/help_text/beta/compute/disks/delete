NAME
    gcloud beta compute disks delete - delete Google Compute Engine persistent
        disks

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute disks delete DISK_NAME [DISK_NAME ...]
        [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute disks delete deletes one or more Google Compute
    Engine persistent disks. Disks can be deleted only if they are not being
    used by any virtual machine instances.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     DISK_NAME [DISK_NAME ...]
        Names of the disks to delete.

FLAGS
     At most one of these may be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the disks to delete. If not specified, you may be prompted
          to select a region.

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/region property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/region

          Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the disks to delete. If not specified and the compute/zone
          property isn't set, you may be prompted to select a zone.

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/zone property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

          Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in BETA and may change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute disks delete
        $ gcloud alpha compute disks delete
