NAME
    gcloud beta compute disks snapshot - create snapshots of Google Compute
        Engine persistent disks

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute disks snapshot DISK_NAME [DISK_NAME ...] [--async]
        [--csek-key-file=FILE] [--description=DESCRIPTION] [--guest-flush]
        [--snapshot-names=SNAPSHOT_NAME,[...]] [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Create snapshots of Google Compute Engine persistent disks.

    gcloud beta compute disks snapshot creates snapshots of persistent disks.
    Snapshots are useful for backing up data or copying a persistent disk. Once
    created, snapshots may be managed (listed, deleted, etc.) via gcloud
    compute snapshots.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     DISK_NAME [DISK_NAME ...]
        The names of the disks to operate on.

FLAGS
     --async
        Display information about the operation in progress, without waiting
        for the operation to complete.

     --csek-key-file=FILE
        Path to a Customer-Supplied Encryption Key (CSEK) key file, mapping
        Google Compute Engine resources to user managed keys to be used when
        creating, mounting, or snapshotting disks.

        If you pass - as value of the flag the CSEK will be read from stdin.
        See
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-supplied-encryption
        for more details.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional, textual description for the snapshots being created.

     --guest-flush
        Create an application consistent snapshot by informing the OS to
        prepare for the snapshot process. Currently only supported on Windows
        instances using the Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS).

     --snapshot-names=SNAPSHOT_NAME,[...]
        Names to assign to the snapshots. Without this option, the name of each
        snapshot will be a random, 16-character hexadecimal number that starts
        with a letter. The values of this option run parallel to the disks
        specified. For example,

            $ gcloud beta compute disks snapshot my-disk-1 my-disk-2 my-disk-3 \
                --snapshot-names snapshot-1,snapshot-2,snapshot-3

        will result in my-disk-1 being snapshotted as snapshot-1, my-disk-2 as
        snapshot-2, and so on.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --region=REGION
          The region of the disks to operate on. If not specified, you may be
          prompted to select a region.

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/region property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/region

          Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

       --zone=ZONE
          The zone of the disks to operate on. If not specified and the
          compute/zone property isn't set, you may be prompted to select a
          zone.

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/zone property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

          Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in BETA and may change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute disks snapshot
        $ gcloud alpha compute disks snapshot
