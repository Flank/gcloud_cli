NAME
    gcloud beta compute os-config guest-policies lookup - display the guest
        policies that are applied to an instance

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute os-config guest-policies lookup INSTANCE_NAME
        [--zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAME
        Name of the instance to look up guest policies for. For details on
        valid instance names, refer to the criteria documented under the field
        'name' at:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances

FLAGS
     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the instance to look up guest policies for. If not specified,
        the user may be prompted to select a zone. gcloud will attempt to
        identify the zone by searching for resources in the user's project. If
        the zone cannot be determined, the user will then be prompted with all
        Google Cloud Platform zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, the user can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To view all guest policies that are applied to an instance named
    my-instance, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute os-config guest-policies lookup my-instance

NOTES
    This command is currently in BETA and may change without notice. This
    variant is also available:

        $ gcloud alpha compute os-config guest-policies lookup
