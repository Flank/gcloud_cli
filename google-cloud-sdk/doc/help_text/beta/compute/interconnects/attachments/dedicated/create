NAME
    gcloud beta compute interconnects attachments dedicated create - create a
        Google Compute Engine dedicated interconnect attachment

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute interconnects attachments dedicated create NAME
        --interconnect=INTERCONNECT --router=ROUTER
        [--candidate-subnets=[SUBNET,...]] [--description=DESCRIPTION]
        [--enable-admin] [--region=REGION] [--vlan=VLAN] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute interconnects attachments dedicated create is
    used to create a dedicated interconnect attachments. An interconnect
    attachment is what binds the underlying connectivity of an interconnect to
    a path into and out of the customer's cloud network.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the interconnect attachment to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --interconnect=INTERCONNECT
        The interconnect for the interconnect attachment

     --router=ROUTER
        The Google Cloud Router to use for dynamic routing.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --candidate-subnets=[SUBNET,...]
        Up to 16 candidate prefixes that can be used to restrict the allocation
        of cloudRouterIpAddress and customerRouterIpAddress for this
        attachment. All prefixes must be within link-local address space.
        Google will attempt to select an unused /29 from the supplied candidate
        subnet(s), or all of link-local space if no subnets supplied. Google
        will not re-use a /29 already in-use by your project, even if it's
        contained in one of the candidate subnets. The request will fail if all
        /29s within the candidate subnets are in use at Google's edge.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Human-readable plain-text description of attachment.

     --enable-admin
        Administrative status of the interconnect attachment. If not provided
        on creation, defaults to enabled. When this is enabled, the attachment
        is operational and will carry traffic. Use --no-enable-admin to disable
        it.

     --region=REGION
        Region of the interconnect attachment to create. If not specified, you
        may be prompted to select a region.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     --vlan=VLAN
        Desired VLAN for this attachment, in the range 2-4094. If not supplied,
        Google will automatically select a VLAN.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in BETA and may change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute interconnects attachments dedicated create
        $ gcloud alpha compute interconnects attachments dedicated create
