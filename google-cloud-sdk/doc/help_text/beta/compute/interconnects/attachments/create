NAME
    gcloud beta compute interconnects attachments create - create a Google
        Compute Engine interconnect attachment

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute interconnects attachments create NAME
        --interconnect=INTERCONNECT --router=ROUTER [--description=DESCRIPTION]
        [--region=REGION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute interconnects attachments create is used to
    create interconnect attachments. An interconnect attachment is what binds
    the underlying connectivity of an Interconnect to a path into and out of
    the customer's cloud network.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the interconnect attachment to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --interconnect=INTERCONNECT
        The interconnect for the interconnect attachment

     --router=ROUTER
        The Google Cloud Router to use for dynamic routing.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional, textual description for the interconnect attachment.

     --region=REGION
        The region of the interconnect attachment to create. If not specified,
        you may be prompted to select a region.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in BETA and may change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute interconnects attachments create
        $ gcloud alpha compute interconnects attachments create
