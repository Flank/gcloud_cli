        check to monitor load balanced instances

        [--check-interval=CHECK_INTERVAL; default="5s"]
        [--description=DESCRIPTION]
        [--healthy-threshold=HEALTHY_THRESHOLD; default=2] [--host=HOST]
        [--port=PORT; default=443] [--request-path=REQUEST_PATH; default="/"]

        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute https-health-checks create is used to create an
    HTTPS health check. HTTPS health checks monitor instances in a load
    balancer controlled by a target pool. All arguments to the command are
    optional except for the name of the health check. For more information on
    load balancing, see
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing-and-autoscaling/

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the HTTPS health check to create.

FLAGS
     --check-interval=CHECK_INTERVAL; default="5s"
        How often to perform a health check for an instance. For example,
        specifying 10s will run the check every 10 seconds. The default value
        is 5s. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on duration
        formats.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional, textual description for the HTTPS health check.

     --healthy-threshold=HEALTHY_THRESHOLD; default=2
        The number of consecutive successful health checks before an unhealthy
        instance is marked as healthy. The default is 2.

     --host=HOST
        The value of the host header used in this HTTPS health check request.
        By default, this is empty and Google Compute Engine automatically sets
        the host header in health requests to the same external IP address as
        the forwarding rule associated with the target pool.

     --port=PORT; default=443
        The TCP port number that this health check monitors. The default value
        is 443.

     --request-path=REQUEST_PATH; default="/"
        The request path that this health check monitors. For example,
        /healthcheck. The default value is ``/''.

     --timeout=TIMEOUT; default="5s"
        If Google Compute Engine doesn't receive an HTTPS 200 response from the
        instance by the time specified by the value of this flag, the health
        check request is considered a failure. For example, specifying 10s will
        cause the check to wait for 10 seconds before considering the request a
        failure. The default value is 5s. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for
        information on duration formats.

     --unhealthy-threshold=UNHEALTHY_THRESHOLD; default=2
        The number of consecutive health check failures before a healthy
        instance is marked as unhealthy. The default is 2.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES

    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute https-health-checks create
