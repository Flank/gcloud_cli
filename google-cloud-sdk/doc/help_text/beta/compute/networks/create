NAME
    gcloud beta compute networks create - create a Google Compute Engine
        network

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute networks create NAME
        [--bgp-routing-mode=MODE; default="regional"]
        [--description=DESCRIPTION] [--range=RANGE]
        [--mode=NETWORK_TYPE | --subnet-mode=MODE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute networks create is used to create virtual
    networks. A network performs the same function that a router does in a home
    network: it describes the network range and gateway IP address, handles
    communication between instances, and serves as a gateway between instances
    and callers outside the network.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the network to create.

FLAGS
     --bgp-routing-mode=MODE; default="regional"
        The BGP routing mode for this network. If not specified, defaults to
        regional.

        MODE must be one of:

         global
            Cloud Routers in this network advertise subnetworks from all
            regions to their BGP peers, and program instances in all regions
            with the router's best learned BGP routes.
         regional
            Cloud Routers in this network advertise subnetworks from their
            local region only to their BGP peers, and program instances in
            their local region only with the router's best learned BGP routes.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional, textual description for the network.

     --range=RANGE
        Specifies the IPv4 address range of legacy mode networks. The range
        must be specified in CIDR format:
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing

        This flag only works if mode is legacy
        (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/vpc/legacy).

        Using legacy networks is **not recommended**, given that many newer
        Google Cloud Platform features are not supported on legacy networks.
        Please be advised that legacy networks may not be supported in the
        future.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --mode=NETWORK_TYPE
          (REMOVED) The network type.

          mode has been removed. Please use subnet-mode instead. NETWORK_TYPE
          must be one of:

       auto
          Subnets are created automatically. This is the recommended selection.
       custom
          Create subnets manually.
       legacy
          Create an old style network that has a range and cannot have subnets.
          This is not recommended for new networks.

       --subnet-mode=MODE
          The subnet mode of the network. If not specified, defaults to AUTO.

          MODE must be one of:

       auto
          Subnets are created automatically. This is the recommended selection.
       custom
          Create subnets manually.
       legacy
          Create an old style network that has a range and cannot have subnets.
          This is not recommended for new networks.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in BETA and may change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute networks create
        $ gcloud alpha compute networks create
