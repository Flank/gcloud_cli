DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Updates properties of an existing Google Compute Engine subnetwork.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the subnetwork to update.

FLAGS
     --drain-timeout=DRAIN_TIMEOUT; default="0s"
        The time period for draining traffic from Internal HTTP(S) Load
        Balancer proxies that are assigned addresses in the current ACTIVE
        subnetwork. For example, 1h, 60m and 3600s each specify a duration of 1
        hour for draining the traffic. Longer times reduce the number of
        proxies that are draining traffic at any one time, and so improve the
        availability of proxies for load balancing. The drain timeout is only
        applicable when the [--role=ACTIVE] flag is being used.

     --logging-aggregation-interval=LOGGING_AGGREGATION_INTERVAL
        Can only be specified if VPC flow logging for this subnetwork is
        enabled. Toggles the aggregation interval for collecting flow logs.
        Increasing the interval time will reduce the amount of generated flow
        logs for long lasting connections. Default is an interval of 5 seconds
        per connection. LOGGING_AGGREGATION_INTERVAL must be one of:
        interval-10-min, interval-15-min, interval-1-min, interval-30-sec,
        interval-5-min, interval-5-sec.

     --logging-flow-sampling=LOGGING_FLOW_SAMPLING
        Can only be specified if VPC flow logging for this subnetwork is
        enabled. The value of the field must be in [0, 1]. Set the sampling
        rate of VPC flow logs within the subnetwork where 1.0 means all
        collected logs are reported and 0.0 means no logs are reported. Default
        is 0.5 which means half of all collected logs are reported.

     --logging-metadata=LOGGING_METADATA
        Can only be specified if VPC flow logging for this subnetwork is
        enabled. Configures whether metadata fields should be added to the
        reported VPC flow logs. Default is to include all metadata.
        LOGGING_METADATA must be one of: exclude-all, include-all.

     --region=REGION
        Region of the subnetwork to update. If not specified, you may be
        prompted to select a region.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --add-secondary-ranges=PROPERTY=VALUE,[...]
          Adds secondary IP ranges to the subnetwork for use in IP aliasing.

          For example, --add-secondary-ranges range1=192.168.64.0/24 adds a
          secondary range 192.168.64.0/24 with name range1.

          + RANGE_NAME - Name of the secondary range.
          + RANGE - IP range in CIDR format.

         --[no-]enable-flow-logs
            Enable/disable VPC flow logging for this subnet. More information
            for VPC flow logs can be found at
            https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/using-flow-logs. Use
            --enable-flow-logs to enable and --no-enable-flow-logs to disable.

         --[no-]enable-private-ip-google-access
            Enable/disable access to Google Cloud APIs from this subnet for
            instances without a public ip address. Use
            --enable-private-ip-google-access to enable and
            --no-enable-private-ip-google-access to disable.

         --private-ipv6-google-access-type=PRIVATE_IPV6_GOOGLE_ACCESS_TYPE
            The private IPv6 google access type for the VMs in this subnet.
            PRIVATE_IPV6_GOOGLE_ACCESS_TYPE must be one of: disable,
            enable-bidirectional-access, enable-outbound-vm-access.

         --remove-secondary-ranges=PROPERTY=VALUE,[...]
            Removes secondary ranges from the subnetwork.

            For example, --remove-secondary-ranges range2,range3 removes the
            secondary ranges with names range2 and range3.

         --role=ROLE
            The role is set to ACTIVE to update a BACKUP reserved address range
            to be the new ACTIVE address range. Note that the only supported
            value for this flag is ACTIVE since setting an address range to
            BACKUP is not supported.

            This field is only valid when updating a reserved IP address range
            used for the purpose of Internal HTTP(S) Load Balancer.

            ROLE must be (currently only one value is supported):

             ACTIVE
                The ACTIVE subnet that is currently used.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
