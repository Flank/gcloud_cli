        in custom subnet mode

        [--secondary-range=PROPERTY=VALUE,[...]] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Define a subnet for a network in custom subnet mode. Subnets must be
    uniquely named per region.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the subnetwork to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --network=NETWORK
        The network to which the subnetwork belongs.

     --range=RANGE
        The IP space allocated to this subnetwork in CIDR format.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional description of this subnetwork.

     --enable-flow-logs
        Enable/disable VPC flow logging for this subnet. More information for
        VPC flow logs can be found at
        https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/using-flow-logs.

     --enable-private-ip-google-access
        Enable/disable access to Google Cloud APIs from this subnet for
        instances without a public ip address.

     --logging-aggregation-interval=LOGGING_AGGREGATION_INTERVAL
        Can only be specified if VPC flow logging for this subnetwork is
        enabled. Toggles the aggregation interval for collecting flow logs.
        Increasing the interval time will reduce the amount of generated flow
        logs for long lasting connections. Default is an interval of 5 seconds
        per connection. LOGGING_AGGREGATION_INTERVAL must be one of:
        interval-10-min, interval-15-min, interval-1-min, interval-30-sec,
        interval-5-min, interval-5-sec.

     --logging-flow-sampling=LOGGING_FLOW_SAMPLING
        Can only be specified if VPC flow logging for this subnetwork is
        enabled. The value of the field must be in [0, 1]. Set the sampling
        rate of VPC flow logs within the subnetwork where 1.0 means all
        collected logs are reported and 0.0 means no logs are reported. Default
        is 0.5 which means half of all collected logs are reported.

     --logging-metadata=LOGGING_METADATA
        Can only be specified if VPC flow logging for this subnetwork is
        enabled. Configures whether metadata fields should be added to the
        reported VPC flow logs. Default is to include all metadata.
        LOGGING_METADATA must be one of: exclude-all, include-all.

     --region=REGION
        Region of the subnetwork to create. If not specified, you may be
        prompted to select a region.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     --secondary-range=PROPERTY=VALUE,[...]
        Adds a secondary IP range to the subnetwork for use in IP aliasing.

        For example, --secondary-range range1=192.168.64.0/24 adds a secondary
        range 192.168.64.0/24 with name range1.

        * RANGE_NAME - Name of the secondary range.
        * RANGE - IP range in CIDR format.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in BETA and may change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute networks subnets create
        $ gcloud alpha compute networks subnets create
