           global
              Cloud Routers in this network advertise subnetworks from all
              regions to their BGP peers, and program instances in all regions
              with the router's best learned BGP routes.
           regional
              Cloud Routers in this network advertise subnetworks from their
              local region only to their BGP peers, and program instances in
              their local region only with the router's best learned BGP
