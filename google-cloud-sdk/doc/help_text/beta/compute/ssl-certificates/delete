NAME
    gcloud beta compute ssl-certificates delete - delete Google Compute Engine
        SSL certificates

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute ssl-certificates delete NAME [NAME ...]
        [--global | --region=REGION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute ssl-certificates delete deletes one or more
    Google Compute Engine SSL certificates. SSL certificates can only be
    deleted when no other resources (for example, target HTTPS proxies) refer
    to them.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME [NAME ...]
        Names of the SSL certificates to delete.

FLAGS
     At most one of these may be specified:

       --global
          If set, the SSL certificates are global.

       --region=REGION
          Region of the SSL certificates to delete. If not specified, you may
          be prompted to select a region.

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/region property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/region

          Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To delete a certificate 'my-cert', run:

        $ gcloud beta compute ssl-certificates delete my-cert

    To delete certificates 'my-cert1', 'my-cert2' and 'my-cert3', run:

        $ gcloud beta compute ssl-certificates delete my-cert1 my-cert2 \
          my-cert3

NOTES
    This command is currently in BETA and may change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute ssl-certificates delete
        $ gcloud alpha compute ssl-certificates delete
