NAME
    gcloud beta compute start-iap-tunnel - starts an IAP TCP forwarding tunnel
        over WebSocket connection

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute start-iap-tunnel INSTANCE_NAME INSTANCE_PORT
        [--local-host-port=LOCAL_HOST_PORT; default="localhost:0"]
        [--network-interface=NETWORK_INTERFACE; default="nic0"] [--zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Starts a tunnel to the Cloud Identity-Aware Proxy through which
    another process can create a connection (eg. SSH, RDP) to a Google Compute
    Engine instance.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAME
        Name of the instance to operate on.

     INSTANCE_PORT
        The name or number of the instance's port to connect to.

FLAGS
     --local-host-port=LOCAL_HOST_PORT; default="localhost:0"
        Host:port to which the proxy should be bound.

     --network-interface=NETWORK_INTERFACE; default="nic0"
        Specifies the name of the instance network interface to connect to. If
        this is not provided, then "nic0" is used as the default.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the instance to operate on. If not specified, you may be
        prompted to select a zone. gcloud will attempt to identify the zone by
        searching for resources in your project. If the zone cannot be
        determined, you will then be prompted with all Google Cloud Platform
        zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in BETA and may change without notice. This
    variant is also available:

        $ gcloud alpha compute start-iap-tunnel
