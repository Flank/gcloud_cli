DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute forwarding-rules set-target is used to set a new
    target for a forwarding rule. A forwarding rule directs traffic that
    matches a bound IP address to a forwarding target (load balancer, VPN
    gateway or VM instance).

    Forwarding rules can be either global or regional, specified with the
    --global or --region=REGION flag. Global forwarding rules work with global
    load balancers, which include target HTTP proxies, target HTTPS proxies,
    target SSL proxies and target TCP proxies; regional forwarding rules work
    with regional or zonal targets, which include target pools, target
    instances and target VPN gateways and backend services.

    Forwarding rules can be either external or internal, specified with the
    --load-balancing-scheme=[EXTERNAL|INTERNAL] flag. External forwarding rules
    are accessible from the internet, while internal forwarding rules are only
    accessible from within their VPC networks. You can specify a reserved
    static external or internal IP address with the --address=ADDRESS flag for
    the forwarding rule. Otherwise if the flag is unspecified, an external
    forwaring rule will be automatically assigned an ephemeral external IP
    address (global IP addresses for global forwarding rules and regional IP
    addresses for regional forwarding rules); an internal forwarding rule will
    be automatically assigned an ephemeral internal IP address from the subnet
    specified with the --subnet flag.

    There are different types of load balancer working at different layers of
    the OSI networking model (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_layer).
    Layer 3 load balancer targets include target pools, target SSL proxies,
    target TCP proxies and backend services. Layer 7 load balancer targets
    include target HTTP proxies and target HTTPS proxies. For more information
    on load balancing, see
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing-and-autoscaling/.

    When creating a forwarding rule, exactly one of --target-instance,
    --target-pool, --target-http-proxy, --target-https-proxy,
    --target-ssl-proxy, --target-tcp-proxy or --target-vpn-gateway must be
    specified.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the forwarding rule to operate on.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --backend-service=BACKEND_SERVICE
          The target backend service that will receive the traffic.

       --target-http-proxy=TARGET_HTTP_PROXY
          The target HTTP proxy that will receive the traffic. Acceptable
          values for --ports flag are: 80, 8080.

       --target-https-proxy=TARGET_HTTPS_PROXY
          The target HTTPS proxy that will receive the traffic. Acceptable
          values for --ports flag are: 443.

       --target-instance=TARGET_INSTANCE
          The name of the target instance that will receive the traffic. The
          target instance must be in a zone that's in the forwarding rule's
          region. Global forwarding rules may not direct traffic to target
          instances. If not specified and the compute/zone property isn't set,
          you may be prompted to select a zone.

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/zone property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

          Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

       --target-pool=TARGET_POOL
          The target pool that will receive the traffic. The target pool must
          be in the same region as the forwarding rule. Global forwarding rules
          may not direct traffic to target pools.

       --target-ssl-proxy=TARGET_SSL_PROXY
          The target SSL proxy that will receive the traffic. Acceptable values
          for --ports flag are: 25, 43, 110, 143, 195, 443, 465, 587, 700, 993,
          995, 1883, 5222.

       --target-tcp-proxy=TARGET_TCP_PROXY
          The target TCP proxy that will receive the traffic. Acceptable values
          for --ports flag are: 25, 43, 110, 143, 195, 443, 465, 587, 700, 993,
          995, 1883, 5222.

       --target-vpn-gateway=TARGET_VPN_GATEWAY
          The target VPN gateway that will receive forwarded traffic.
          Acceptable values for --ports flag are: 500, 4500.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --load-balancing-scheme=LOAD_BALANCING_SCHEME; default="EXTERNAL"
        This signifies what the forwarding rule will be used for.
        LOAD_BALANCING_SCHEME must be one of:

         EXTERNAL
            External load balancing or forwarding, used with one of
            --target-http-proxy, --target-https-proxy, --target-tcp-proxy,
            --target-ssl-proxy, --target-pool, --target-vpn-gateway,
            --target-instance.
         INTERNAL
            Internal load balancing or forwarding, used with --backend-service.

     --network=NETWORK
        (Only for --load-balancing-scheme=INTERNAL) The network that this
        forwarding rule applies to. If this field is not specified, the default
        network will be used. In the absence of the default network, this field
        must be specified.

     --subnet=SUBNET
        (Only for --load-balancing-scheme=INTERNAL) The subnetwork that this
        forwarding rule applies to. If the network configured for this
        forwarding rule is in auto subnet mode, this flag is optional and the
        subnet in the same region of the forwarding rule will be used. However,
        if the network is in custom subnet mode, a subnetwork must be
        specified.

     --subnet-region=SUBNET_REGION
        Region of the subnetwork to operate on. If not specified it will be set
        the region of the forwarding rule. Overrides the default compute/region
        property value for this command invocation.

     --target-instance-zone=TARGET_INSTANCE_ZONE
        Zone of the target instance to operate on. Overrides the default
        compute/zone property value for this command invocation.

     --target-pool-region=TARGET_POOL_REGION
        Region of the target pool to operate on. If not specified it will be
        set the region of the forwarding rule. Overrides the default
        compute/region property value for this command invocation.

     --target-vpn-gateway-region=TARGET_VPN_GATEWAY_REGION
        Region of the VPN gateway to operate on. If not specified it will be
        set the region of the forwarding rule. Overrides the default
        compute/region property value for this command invocation.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --backend-service-region=BACKEND_SERVICE_REGION
          Region of the backend service to operate on. If not specified it will
          be set the region of the forwarding rule. Overrides the default
          compute/region property value for this command invocation.

       --global-backend-service
          If set, the backend service is global.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --global
          If set, the forwarding rule is global.

       --region=REGION
          Region of the forwarding rule to operate on. If not specified, you
          may be prompted to select a region.

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/region property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/region

          Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.
