NAME
    gcloud beta compute instances set-machine-type - set machine type for
        Google Compute Engine virtual machines

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute instances set-machine-type INSTANCE_NAME
        [--machine-type=MACHINE_TYPE] [--zone=ZONE]
        [--custom-cpu=CUSTOM_CPU --custom-memory=CUSTOM_MEMORY
          : --custom-extensions --custom-vm-type=CUSTOM_VM_TYPE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute instances set-machine-type allows you to change
    the machine type of a virtual machine in the TERMINATED state (that is, a
    virtual machine instance that has been stopped).

    For example, if example-instance is a g1-small virtual machine currently in
    the TERMINATED state, running:

        $ gcloud beta compute instances set-machine-type example-instance \
            --zone us-central1-b --machine-type n1-standard-4

    will change the machine type to n1-standard-4, so that when you next start
    example-instance, it will be provisioned as an n1-standard-4 instead of a
    g1-small.

    See https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types for more
    information on machine types.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAME
        Name of the instance to operate on.

FLAGS
     --machine-type=MACHINE_TYPE
        Specifies the machine type used for the instances. To get a list of
        available machine types, run 'gcloud compute machine-types list'.
        Either this flag, --custom-cpu, or --custom-memory must be specified.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the instance to operate on. If not specified, the user may be
        prompted to select a zone. gcloud will attempt to identify the zone by
        searching for resources in the user's project. If the zone cannot be
        determined, the user will then be prompted with all Google Cloud
        Platform zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, the user can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

     Custom machine type extensions.

       --custom-cpu=CUSTOM_CPU
          A whole number value indicating how many cores are desired in the
          custom machine type. This flag must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --custom-memory=CUSTOM_MEMORY
          A whole number value indicating how much memory is desired in the
          custom machine type. A size unit should be provided (eg. 3072MB or
          9GB) - if no units are specified, GB is assumed. This flag must be
          specified if any of the other arguments in this group are specified.

       --custom-extensions
          Use the extended custom machine type.

       --custom-vm-type=CUSTOM_VM_TYPE
          Specifies VM type. n1 - VMs with CPU platforms Skylake and older, n2
          - VMs with CPU platform Cascade Lake. n2 offers flexible sizing from
          2 to 80 vCPUs, and 1 to 640GBs of memory. It also features a number
          of performance enhancements including exposing a more accurate NUMA
          topology to the guest OS. The default is n1.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in BETA and may change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute instances set-machine-type
        $ gcloud alpha compute instances set-machine-type
