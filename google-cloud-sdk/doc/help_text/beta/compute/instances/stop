NAME
    gcloud beta compute instances stop - stop a virtual machine instance

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute instances stop INSTANCE_NAMES [INSTANCE_NAMES ...]
        [--async] [--zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute instances stop is used to stop a Compute Engine
    virtual machine. Stopping a VM performs a clean shutdown, much like
    invoking the shutdown functionality of a workstation or laptop. Stopping a
    VM with a local SSD is not supported and will result in an API error.
    Stopping a VM which is already stopped will return without errors.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAMES [INSTANCE_NAMES ...]
        Names of the instances to operate on. For details on valid instance
        names, refer to the criteria documented under the field 'name' at:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances

FLAGS
     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the instances to operate on. If not specified, the user may be
        prompted to select a zone. gcloud will attempt to identify the zone by
        searching for resources in the user's project. If the zone cannot be
        determined, the user will then be prompted with all Google Cloud
        Platform zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, the user can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To stop an instance named test-instance, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute instances stop test-instance

NOTES
    This command is currently in BETA and may change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute instances stop
        $ gcloud alpha compute instances stop
