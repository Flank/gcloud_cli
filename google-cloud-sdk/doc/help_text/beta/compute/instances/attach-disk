NAME
    gcloud beta compute instances attach-disk - attach a disk to an instance

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute instances attach-disk INSTANCE_NAME --disk=DISK
        [--boot] [--csek-key-file=FILE] [--device-name=DEVICE_NAME]
        [--disk-scope=DISK_SCOPE; default="zonal"] [--force-attach]
        [--mode=MODE; default="rw"] [--zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute instances attach-disk is used to attach a disk
    to an instance. For example,

        $ gcloud compute instances attach-disk example-instance \
            --disk DISK --zone us-central1-a

    attaches the disk named 'DISK' to the instance named 'example-instance' in
    zone us-central1-a.

    After you create and attach a new disk to an instance, you must format and
    mount
    (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/add-persistent-disk#formatting)
    the disk so that the operating system can use the available storage space.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAME
        Name of the instance to operate on.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --disk=DISK
        The name of the disk to attach to the instance.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --boot
        Attach the disk to the instance as a boot disk.

     --csek-key-file=FILE
        Path to a Customer-Supplied Encryption Key (CSEK) key file, mapping
        Google Compute Engine resources to user managed keys to be used when
        creating, mounting, or snapshotting disks.

        If you pass - as value of the flag the CSEK will be read from stdin.
        See
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-supplied-encryption
        for more details.

     --device-name=DEVICE_NAME
        An optional name that indicates the disk name the guest operating
        system will see. (Note: Device name does not correspond to mounted
        volume name). Must match the disk name if the disk is going to be
        mounted to a container with --container-mount-disk (alpha feature).

     --disk-scope=DISK_SCOPE; default="zonal"
        The scope of the disk. DISK_SCOPE must be one of:

         regional
            The disk specified in --disk is interpreted as a regional disk in
            the same region as the instance. Ignored if a full URI is provided
            to the --disk flag.
         zonal
            The disk specified in --disk is interpreted as a zonal disk in the
            same zone as the instance. Ignored if a full URI is provided to the
            --disk flag.

     --force-attach
        Attach the disk to the instance even if it is currently attached to
        another instance. The attachment will succeed even if detaching from
        the previous instance fails at first. The server will continue trying
        to detach the disk from the previous instance in the background.

     --mode=MODE; default="rw"
        Specifies the mode of the disk. MODE must be one of:

         ro
            Read-only.
         rw
            Read-write. It is an error to attach a disk in read-write mode to
            more than one instance.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the instance to operate on. If not specified, the user may be
        prompted to select a zone. gcloud will attempt to identify the zone by
        searching for resources in the user's project. If the zone cannot be
        determined, the user will then be prompted with all Google Cloud
        Platform zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, the user can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in BETA and may change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute instances attach-disk
        $ gcloud alpha compute instances attach-disk
