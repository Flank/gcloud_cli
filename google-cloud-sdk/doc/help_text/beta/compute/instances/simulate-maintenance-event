NAME
    gcloud beta compute instances simulate-maintenance-event - simulate
        maintenance of virtual machine instances

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute instances simulate-maintenance-event INSTANCE_NAMES
        [INSTANCE_NAMES ...] [--async] [--zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute instances simulate-maintenance-event simulates a
    maintenance event on Google Compute Engine virtual machines.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAMES [INSTANCE_NAMES ...]
        Names of the instances to operate on.

FLAGS
     --async
        Display information about the operation in progress, without waiting
        for the operation to complete.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the instances to operate on. If not specified, you may be
        prompted to select a zone. gcloud will attempt to identify the zone by
        searching for resources in your project. If the zone cannot be
        determined, you will then be prompted with all Google Cloud Platform
        zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in BETA and may change without notice. This
    variant is also available:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instances simulate-maintenance-event
