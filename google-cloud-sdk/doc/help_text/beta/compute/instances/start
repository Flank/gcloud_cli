NAME
    gcloud beta compute instances start - start a stopped virtual machine
        instance

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute instances start INSTANCE_NAMES [INSTANCE_NAMES ...]
        [--async] [--csek-key-file=FILE] [--zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute instances start is used to start a stopped
    Google Compute Engine virtual machine. Only a stopped virtual machine can
    be started.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAMES [INSTANCE_NAMES ...]
        Names of the instances to operate on.

FLAGS
     --async
        Display information about the operation in progress, without waiting
        for the operation to complete.

     --csek-key-file=FILE
        Path to a Customer-Supplied Encryption Key (CSEK) key file, mapping
        Google Compute Engine resources to user managed keys to be used when
        creating, mounting, or snapshotting disks.

        If you pass - as value of the flag the CSEK will be read from stdin.
        See
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-supplied-encryption
        for more details.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the instances to operate on. If not specified, you may be
        prompted to select a zone. gcloud will attempt to identify the zone by
        searching for resources in your project. If the zone cannot be
        determined, you will then be prompted with all Google Cloud Platform
        zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in BETA and may change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute instances start
        $ gcloud alpha compute instances start
