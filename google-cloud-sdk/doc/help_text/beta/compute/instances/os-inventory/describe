NAME
    gcloud beta compute instances os-inventory describe - describe a Compute
        Engine virtual instance's OS inventory data

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute instances os-inventory describe INSTANCE_NAME
        [--zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute instances os-inventory describe displays all OS
    inventory data associated with a Compute Engine virtual machine instance.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAME
        Name of the instance to describe. For details on valid instance names,
        refer to the criteria documented under the field 'name' at:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances

FLAGS
     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the instance to describe. If not specified, the user may be
        prompted to select a zone. gcloud will attempt to identify the zone by
        searching for resources in the user's project. If the zone cannot be
        determined, the user will then be prompted with all Google Cloud
        Platform zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, the user can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To see OS inventory of an instance named my-instance, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute instances os-inventory describe my-instance

NOTES
    This command is currently in BETA and may change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute instances os-inventory describe
        $ gcloud alpha compute instances os-inventory describe
