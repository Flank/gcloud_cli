NAME
    gcloud beta compute instances update-access-config - update a Google
        Compute Engine virtual machine access configuration

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute instances update-access-config INSTANCE_NAME
        [--network-interface=NETWORK_INTERFACE; default="nic0"] [--zone=ZONE]
        [--public-ptr | --no-public-ptr]
        [--public-ptr-domain=PUBLIC_PTR_DOMAIN | --no-public-ptr-domain]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute instances update-access-config is used to update
    access configurations for network interfaces of Google Compute Engine
    virtual machines.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     INSTANCE_NAME
        Name of the instance to operate on.

FLAGS
     --network-interface=NETWORK_INTERFACE; default="nic0"
        Specifies the name of the network interface which contains the access
        configuration. If this is not provided, then "nic0" is used as the
        default.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the instance to operate on. If not specified, you may be
        prompted to select a zone. gcloud will attempt to identify the zone by
        searching for resources in your project. If the zone cannot be
        determined, you will then be prompted with all Google Cloud Platform
        zones.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --public-ptr
          Creates a DNS PTR record for the external IP in the access
          configuration. This option can only be specified for the default
          network-interface, "nic0".

       --no-public-ptr
          If provided, no DNS PTR record is created for the external IP in the
          access configuration. Mutually exclusive with public-ptr-domain.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --public-ptr-domain=PUBLIC_PTR_DOMAIN
          Assigns a custom PTR domain for the external IP in the access
          configuration. Mutually exclusive with no-public-ptr. This option can
          only be specified for the default network-interface, "nic0".

       --no-public-ptr-domain
          If both this flag and --public-ptr are specified, creates a DNS PTR
          record for the external IP in the access configuration with the PTR
          domain name being the DNS name of the instance.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in BETA and may change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute instances update-access-config
        $ gcloud alpha compute instances update-access-config
