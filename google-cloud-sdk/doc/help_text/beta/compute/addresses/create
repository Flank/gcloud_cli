NAME
    gcloud beta compute addresses create - reserve IP addresses

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute addresses create [NAME ...] [--description=DESCRIPTION]
        [--subnet=SUBNET]
        [--addresses=ADDRESS,[ADDRESS,...] | --ip-version=IP_VERSION]
        [--global | --region=REGION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute addresses create is used to reserve one or more
    IP addresses. Once an IP address is reserved, it will be associated with
    the project until it is released using 'gcloud compute addresses delete'.
    Ephemeral IP addresses that are in use by resources in the project, can be
    reserved using the --addresses flag.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     [NAME ...]
        The names of the addresses to create.

FLAGS
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional textual description for the addresses.

     --subnet=SUBNET
        If specified, the subnet name in which the address(es) should be
        reserved. The subnet must be in the same region as the address.

        The address will represent an internal IP reservation from within the
        subnet. If --address is specified, it must be within the subnet's IP
        range.

        May not be specified with --global.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --addresses=ADDRESS,[ADDRESS,...]
          Ephemeral IP addresses to promote to reserved status. Only addresses
          that are being used by resources in the project can be promoted. When
          providing this flag, a parallel list of names for the addresses can
          be provided. For example,

              $ gcloud beta compute addresses create ADDRESS-1 ADDRESS-2         \
                    --addresses 162.222.181.197,162.222.181.198             \
                --region us-central1

          will result in 162.222.181.197 being reserved as 'ADDRESS-1' and
          162.222.181.198 as 'ADDRESS-2'. If no names are given,
          server-generated names will be assigned to the IP addresses.

       --ip-version=IP_VERSION
          The version of the IP address to be allocated and reserved if
          --addresses is not used. The default is IPv4. IP_VERSION must be one
          of: IPV4, IPV6.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --global
          If provided, it is assumed the addresses are global.

       --region=REGION
          The region of the addresses to create. Overrides the default
          compute/region property value for this command invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To reserve three IP addresses in the us-central1 region, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute addresses create ADDRESS-1 ADDRESS-2 \
            ADDRESS-3 --region us-central1

    To reserve ephemeral IP addresses 162.222.181.198 and 23.251.146.189 which
    are being used by virtual machine instances in the us-central1 region, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute addresses create \
            --addresses 162.222.181.198,23.251.146.189 --region us-central1

    In the above invocation, the two addresses will be assigned random names.

    To reserve an IP address from the subnet default in the us-central1 region,
    run:

        $ gcloud beta compute addresses create SUBNET-ADDRESS-1 \
            --region us-central1 --subnet default

NOTES
    This command is currently in BETA and may change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute addresses create
        $ gcloud alpha compute addresses create
