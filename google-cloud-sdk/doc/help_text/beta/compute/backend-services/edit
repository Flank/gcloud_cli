NAME
    gcloud beta compute backend-services edit - modify backend services

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute backend-services edit BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME
        [--global | --region=REGION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute backend-services edit can be used to modify a
    backend service. The backend service resource is fetched from the server
    and presented in a text editor. After the file is saved and closed, this
    command will update the resource. Only fields that can be modified are
    displayed in the editor.

    Backends are named by their associated instances groups, and one of the
    --group or --instance-group flags is required to identify the backend that
    you are modifying. You cannot "change" the instance group associated with a
    backend, but you can accomplish something similar with backend-services
    remove-backend and backend-services add-backend.

    The editor used to modify the resource is chosen by inspecting the EDITOR
    environment variable.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME
        Name of the backend service to operate on.

FLAGS
     At most one of these may be specified:

       --global
          If set, the backend service is global.

       --region=REGION
          Region of the backend service to operate on. Overrides the default
          compute/region property value for this command invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

    This command is currently in BETA and may change without notice. These
    variants are also available:
