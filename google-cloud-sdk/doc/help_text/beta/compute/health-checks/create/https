DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute health-checks create https is used to create an
    HTTPS non-legacy health check. HTTPS health checks monitor instances in a
    load balancer controlled by a target pool. All arguments to the command are
    optional except for the name of the health check. Note, by default, this
    health check monitors TCP port 80. For more information on load balancing,
    see https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing-and-autoscaling/

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the HTTPS health check to create.

FLAGS
     --check-interval=CHECK_INTERVAL; default="5s"
        How often to perform a health check for an instance. For example,
        specifying 10s will run the check every 10 seconds. The default value
        is 5s. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on duration
        formats.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional string description for the HTTPS health check.

     --healthy-threshold=HEALTHY_THRESHOLD; default=2
        The number of consecutive successful health checks before an unhealthy
        instance is marked as healthy. The default is 2.

     --host=HOST
        The value of the host header used in this HTTP health check request. By
        default, this is empty and Google Compute Engine automatically sets the
        host header in health requests to the same external IP address as the
        forwarding rule associated with the target pool.

     --proxy-header=PROXY_HEADER; default="NONE"
        The type of proxy protocol header to be sent to the backend.
        PROXY_HEADER must be one of:

         NONE
            No proxy header is added.
         PROXY_V1
            Adds the header "PROXY UNKNOWN\r\n".

     --request-path=REQUEST_PATH; default="/"
        The request path that this health check monitors. For example,
        /healthcheck. The default value is ``/''.

     --response=RESPONSE
        When empty, status code of the response determines health. When not
        empty, presence of specified string in first 1024 characters of
        response body determines health. Only ASCII characters allowed.

     --timeout=TIMEOUT; default="5s"
        If Google Compute Engine doesn't receive a healthy response from the
        instance by the time specified by the value of this flag, the health
        check request is considered a failure. For example, specifying 10s will
        cause the check to wait for 10 seconds before considering the request a
        failure. The default value is 5s. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for
        information on duration formats.

     --unhealthy-threshold=UNHEALTHY_THRESHOLD; default=2
        The number of consecutive health check failures before a healthy
        instance is marked as unhealthy. The default is 2.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --global
          If set, the HTTPS health check is global.

       --region=REGION
          Region of the HTTPS health check to create. If not specified, you may
          be prompted to select a region.

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/region property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/region

          Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     These flags configure the port that the health check monitors. If none is
     specified, the default port of 80 is used; if both --port and --port-name
     are specified, --port takes precedence.

       --port=PORT; default=80
          The TCP port number that this health check monitors.

       --port-name=PORT_NAME
          The port name that this health check monitors. By default, this is
          empty.

       --use-serving-port
          If given, use the "serving port" for health checks:

          + When health checking network endpoints in a Network Endpoint
            Group, use the port specified with each endpoint.
          + When health checking other backends, use the port or named port
            of the backend service.
