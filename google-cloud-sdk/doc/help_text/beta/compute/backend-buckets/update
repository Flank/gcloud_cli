    gcloud beta compute backend-buckets update - update a backend bucket

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute backend-buckets update BACKEND_BUCKET_NAME
        [--description=DESCRIPTION] [--enable-cdn]
        [--gcs-bucket-name=GCS_BUCKET_NAME]
        [--signed-url-cache-max-age=SIGNED_URL_CACHE_MAX_AGE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute backend-buckets update is used to update backend
    buckets.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     BACKEND_BUCKET_NAME
        Name of the backend bucket to update.

FLAGS
     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional, textual description for the backend bucket.

     --enable-cdn
        Enable Cloud CDN for the backend bucket. Cloud CDN can cache HTTP
        responses from a backend bucket at the edge of the network, close to
        users.

     --gcs-bucket-name=GCS_BUCKET_NAME
        The name of the Google Cloud Storage bucket to serve from. The storage
        bucket must be in the same project.

     --signed-url-cache-max-age=SIGNED_URL_CACHE_MAX_AGE
        The amount of time up to which the response to a signed URL request
        will be cached in the CDN. After this time period, the Signed URL will
        be revalidated before being served. Cloud CDN will internally act as
        though all responses from this backend had a Cache-Control: public,
        max-age=[TTL] header, regardless of any existing Cache-Control header.
        The actual headers served in responses will not be altered.

        For example, specifying 12h will cause the responses to signed URL
        requests to be cached in the CDN up to 12 hours. See $ gcloud topic
        datetimes for information on duration formats.

        This flag only affects signed URL requests.
