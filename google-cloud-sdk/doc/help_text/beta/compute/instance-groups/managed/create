NAME
    gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed create - create a Compute
        Engine managed instance group

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed create NAME --size=SIZE
        --template=TEMPLATE [--base-instance-name=BASE_INSTANCE_NAME]
        [--description=DESCRIPTION] [--initial-delay=INITIAL_DELAY]
        [--target-pool=[TARGET_POOL,...]] [--zones=ZONE,[ZONE,...]]
        [--health-check=HEALTH_CHECK | --http-health-check=HTTP_HEALTH_CHECK
          | --https-health-check=HTTPS_HEALTH_CHECK]
        [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed create creates a Google
    Compute Engine managed instance group.

    For example, running:

        $ gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed create \
        example-managed-instance-group --zone us-central1-a \
        --template example-instance-template --size 1

    will create one managed instance group called
    'example-managed-instance-group' in the us-central1-a zone.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the managed instance group to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --size=SIZE
        The initial number of instances you want in this group.

     --template=TEMPLATE
        Specifies the instance template to use when creating new instances.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --base-instance-name=BASE_INSTANCE_NAME
        The base name to use for the Compute Engine instances that will be
        created with the managed instance group. If not provided base instance
        name will be the prefix of instance group name.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional description for this group.

     --initial-delay=INITIAL_DELAY
        Specifies the length of the period during which the instance is known
        to be initializing and should not be autohealed even if unhealthy. This
        value cannot be greater than 1 hour. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for
        information on duration formats.

     --target-pool=[TARGET_POOL,...]
        Specifies any target pools you want the instances of this managed
        instance group to be part of.

     --zones=ZONE,[ZONE,...]
        If this flag is specified a regional managed instance group will be
        created. The managed instance group will be in the same region as
        specified zones and will spread instances in it between specified
        zones.

        All zones must belong to the same region. You may specify --region flag
        but it must be the region to which zones belong. This flag is mutually
        exclusive with --zone flag.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --health-check=HEALTH_CHECK
          Name of the health check to operate on.

       --http-health-check=HTTP_HEALTH_CHECK
          (DEPRECATED) Specifies the HTTP health check object used for
          autohealing instances in this group.

          HttpHealthCheck is deprecated. Use --health-check instead.

       --https-health-check=HTTPS_HEALTH_CHECK
          (DEPRECATED) Specifies the HTTPS health check object used for
          autohealing instances in this group.

          HttpsHealthCheck is deprecated. Use --health-check instead.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the managed instance group to create. If not specified, you
          may be prompted to select a region.

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

    If you specify --zones flag this flag must be unspecified or specify the
    region to which the zones you listed belong.

    Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
    invocation.

         --zone=ZONE
            Zone of the managed instance group to create. If not specified, you
            may be prompted to select a zone.

            A list of zones can be fetched by running:

                $ gcloud compute zones list

            Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
            invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in BETA and may change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute instance-groups managed create
        $ gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed create
