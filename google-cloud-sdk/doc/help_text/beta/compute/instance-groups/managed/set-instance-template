SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed set-instance-template NAME
        --template=TEMPLATE [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed set-instance-template
    updates the instance template for an existing managed instance group.

    The new template won't apply to existing instances in the group unless they
    are recreated using the recreate-instances command. But the new template
    does apply to all new instances added to the managed instance group.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        The name of the managed instance group to operate on.

        Compute Engine instance template resource to be used.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     At most one of these may be specified:

       --region=REGION
          The region of the managed instance group to operate on. If not
          specified, you may be prompted to select a region.

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          The zone of the managed instance group to operate on. If not
          specified, you may be prompted to select a zone.

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          invocation.
