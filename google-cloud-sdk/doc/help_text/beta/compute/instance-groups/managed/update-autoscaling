NAME
    gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed update-autoscaling - update
        autoscaling parameters of a managed instance group

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed update-autoscaling NAME
        [--mode=MODE] [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed update-autoscaling
    updates autoscaling parameters of specified managed instance group.

    Autoscalers can use one or more policies listed below. Information on using
    multiple policies can be found here:
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/autoscaler/multiple-policies

    In contrast to gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed set-autoscaling,
    this command only updates specified fields. For instance:

        $ gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed update-autoscaling \
          --mode only-up

    would change the mode field of the autoscaler policy, but leave the rest of
    the settings intact.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the managed instance group to operate on.

FLAGS
     --mode=MODE
        Set the mode of an autoscaler for a managed instance group.

        You can turn off or restrict MIG autoscaler activities (scaling up,
        scaling down) without changing autoscaler configuration and then having
        to restore it later. Autoscaler configuration persists while the
        activities are turned off or restricted, and the activities pick it up
        when they are turned on again or when the restrictions are lifted.

        MODE must be one of:

         off
            to turn off autoscaling, while keeping the new configuration.
         on
            to permit autoscaling to scale up and down (default for new
            autoscalers).
         only-up
            to permit autoscaling to scale only up and not down.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified,
          you may be prompted to select a region.

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified,
          you may be prompted to select a zone.

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
          invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

EXAMPLES
    To update an existing instance group:

        $ gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed update-autoscaling \
          --mode=only-up

NOTES
    This command is currently in BETA and may change without notice. This
    variant is also available:

        $ gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed update-autoscaling
