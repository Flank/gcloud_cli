NAME
    gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed update-autoscaling - update
        autoscaling parameters of a managed instance group

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed update-autoscaling NAME
        [--mode=MODE]
        [--clear-scale-in-control
          | --scale-in-control=[max-scaled-in-replicas=MAX-SCALED-IN-REPLICAS],
          [max-scaled-in-replicas-percent=MAX-SCALED-IN-REPLICAS-PERCENT],
          [time-window=TIME-WINDOW]] [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed update-autoscaling
    updates autoscaling parameters of specified managed instance group.

    Autoscalers can use one or more policies listed below. Information on using
    multiple policies can be found here:
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/autoscaler/multiple-policies

    In contrast to gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed set-autoscaling,
    this command only updates specified fields. For instance:

        $ gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed update-autoscaling \
          --mode only-scale-out

    would change the mode field of the autoscaler policy, but leave the rest of
    the settings intact.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the managed instance group to operate on.

FLAGS
     --mode=MODE
        Set the mode of an autoscaler for a managed instance group.

        You can turn off or restrict MIG autoscaler activities without
        affecting your autoscaler configuration. The autoscaler configuration
        persists while the activities are turned off or restricted, and the
        activities resume when the autoscaler is turned on again or when the
        restrictions are lifted.

        MODE must be one of:

         off
            Turns off autoscaling, while keeping the new configuration.
         on
            Permits autoscaling to scale out and in (default for new
            autoscalers).
         only-scale-out
            Permits autoscaling to scale only out and not in.
         only-up
            (DEPRECATED) Permits autoscaling to scale only out and not in.

                Value `only-up` is deprecated. Use `--mode only-scale-out`
                instead.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --clear-scale-in-control
          If specified, the scale-in-control field will be cleared. Using this
          flag will remove any configuration set by --scale-in-control flag.

       --scale-in-control=[max-scaled-in-replicas=MAX-SCALED-IN-REPLICAS],[max-scaled-in-replicas-percent=MAX-SCALED-IN-REPLICAS-PERCENT],[time-window=TIME-WINDOW]
          Configuration that allows slower scale in so that even if Autoscaler
          recommends an abrupt scale in of a managed instance group, it will be
          throttled as specified by the parameters.

       max-scaled-in-replicas
          Maximum allowed number of VMs that can be deducted from the peak
          recommendation during the window. Possibly all these VMs can be
          deleted at once so the application needs to be prepared to lose that
          many VMs in one step. Mutually exclusive with
          'max-scaled-in-replicas-percent'.

       max-scaled-in-replicas-percent
          Maximum allowed percent of VMs that can be deducted from the peak
          recommendation during the window. Possibly all these VMs can be
          deleted at once so the application needs to be prepared to lose that
          many VMs in one step. Mutually exclusive with
          'max-scaled-in-replicas'.

       time-window
          How long back autoscaling should look when computing recommendations.
          The autoscaler will not resize below the maximum allowed deduction
          subtracted from the peak size observed in this period. Measured in
          seconds.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified,
          you may be prompted to select a region.

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified,
          you may be prompted to select a zone.

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
          invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To update an existing instance group:

        $ gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed update-autoscaling \
          --mode=only-scale-out

NOTES
    This command is currently in BETA and may change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute instance-groups managed update-autoscaling
        $ gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed update-autoscaling
