SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed rolling-action restart NAME

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed rolling-action restart
    restarts instances in a managed instance group.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the managed instance group to operate on.

FLAGS
     --max-unavailable=MAX_UNAVAILABLE
        Maximum number of instances that can be unavailable during the update
        process. This can be a fixed number (e.g. 5) or a percentage of size to
        the managed instance group (e.g. 10%)

     --min-ready=MIN_READY
        Minimum time for which a newly created instance should be ready to be
        considered available. For example 10s for 10 seconds. See $ gcloud
        topic datetimes for information on duration formats.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --region=REGION
          The region of the managed instance group to operate on. If not
          specified, you may be prompted to select a region.

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          The zone of the managed instance group to operate on. If not
          specified, you may be prompted to select a zone.

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
          invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.
