    the given versions and the given update policy.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the managed instance group to operate on.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --version=[template=TEMPLATE,[name=NAME],...]
        Original instance template resource to be used. Each version has the
        following format: template=TEMPLATE,[name=NAME]

COMMONLY USED FLAGS
     --canary-version=[template=TEMPLATE,target-size=FIXED_OR_PERCENT,[name=NAME],...]
        New instance template resource to be used. Each version has the
        following format:
        template=TEMPLATE,target-size=FIXED_OR_PERCENT,[name=NAME]

     --type=TYPE; default="proactive"
        Desired update type. TYPE must be one of:

         opportunistic
            Do not proactively replace instances. Create new instances and
            delete old on resizes of the group.
         proactive
            Replace instances proactively.

OTHER FLAGS
     --force
        If set, accepts any original or new version configurations without
        validation.

     --max-surge=MAX_SURGE
        Maximum additional number of instances that can be created during the
        update process. This can be a fixed number (e.g. 5) or a percentage of
        size to the managed instance group (e.g. 10%)

     --max-unavailable=MAX_UNAVAILABLE
        Maximum number of instances that can be unavailable during the update
        process. This can be a fixed number (e.g. 5) or a percentage of size to
        the managed instance group (e.g. 10%)

     --min-ready=MIN_READY
        Minimum time for which a newly created instance should be ready to be
        considered available. For example 10s for 10 seconds. See $ gcloud
        topic datetimes for information on duration formats.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --region=REGION
          The region of the managed instance group to operate on. If not
          specified, you may be prompted to select a region.

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          The zone of the managed instance group to operate on. If not
          specified, you may be prompted to select a zone.

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
          invocation.

    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
