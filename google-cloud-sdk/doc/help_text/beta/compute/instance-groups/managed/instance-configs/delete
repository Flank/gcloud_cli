NAME
    gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed instance-configs delete -
        delete per-instance configs from a managed instance group

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed instance-configs delete NAME
        --instances=INSTANCE,[INSTANCE,...]
        [--instance-update-minimal-action=INSTANCE_UPDATE_MINIMAL_ACTION;
          default="none"] [--no-update-instance]
        [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed instance-configs delete
    deletes one or more per-instance configs from a Google Compute Engine
    managed instance group.

    Changes are applied immediately to the corresponding instances, by
    performing the necessary action (for example, REFRESH), unless overridden
    by providing the --no-update-instance flag.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the managed instance group to delete.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --instances=INSTANCE,[INSTANCE,...]
        Names of instances to delete instance-configs from.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --instance-update-minimal-action=INSTANCE_UPDATE_MINIMAL_ACTION; default="none"
        Perform at least this action on the instance while updating, if
        --update-instance is set to true. INSTANCE_UPDATE_MINIMAL_ACTION must
        be one of:

         none
            No action
         refresh
            Apply properties that are possible to apply without stopping the
            instance
         replace
            Delete the instance and create it again
         restart
            Stop the instance and start it again

     --update-instance
        Apply the configuration changes immediately to the instance. If you
        disable this flag, the managed instance group will apply the config
        update when you next recreate or update the instance.

        Example: say you have an instance with a disk attached to it and you
        created a stateful config for the disk. If you decide to delete the
        stateful config for the disk and you provide this flag, the MIG
        immediately refreshes the instance and removes the stateful config for
        the disk. Similarly if you have attached a new disk or changed its
        definition, with this flag the MIG immediately refreshes the instance
        with the new config.

        Enabled by default, use --no-update-instance to disable.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the managed instance group to delete. If not specified, you
          may be prompted to select a region.

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the managed instance group to delete. If not specified, you
          may be prompted to select a zone.

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
          invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To delete the per-instance config from my-instance, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed instance-configs \
            delete my-group --region=europe-west4 --instances=my-instance

    This removes all metadata and detaches all disks that were defined in the
    per-instance config (except for disks that are also defined in the instance
    template, which remain attached).

NOTES
    This command is currently in BETA and may change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute instance-groups managed instance-configs delete
        $ gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed instance-configs \
            delete
