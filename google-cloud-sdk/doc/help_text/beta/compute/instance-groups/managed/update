DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Update Compute Engine managed instance groups.

    gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed update allows you to specify or
    modify the StatefulPolicy and AutoHealingPolicy for an existing managed
    instance group.

    Stateful Policy defines what stateful resources should be preserved for the
    group. When instances in the group are removed or recreated, those stateful
    properties are always applied to them. This command allows you to change
    the preserved resources by adding more disks or removing existing disks and
    allows you to turn on and off preserving instance names.

    When updating the AutoHealingPolicy, you may specify the health check,
    initial delay, or both. If the field is unspecified, its value won't be
    modified. If --health-check is specified, the health check will be used to
    monitor the health of your application. Whenever the health check signal
    for the instance becomes UNHEALTHY, the autohealing action (RECREATE) on an
    instance will be performed.

    If no health check is specified, the instance autohealing will be triggered
    by the instance status only (i.e. the autohealing action (RECREATE) on an
    instance will be performed if instance.status is not RUNNING).

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the managed instance group to update.

FLAGS
     --instance-redistribution-type=TYPE
        Specifies the type of the instance redistribution policy. An instance
        redistribution type lets you enable or disable automatic instance
        redistribution across zones to meet the target distribution. The target
        distribution is a state of a regional managed instance group where all
        instances are spread out evenly across all target zones.

        An instance redistribution type can be specified only for a
        non-autoscaled regional managed instance group. By default it is set to
        PROACTIVE.

        The following types are available:

        * NONE - The managed instance group does not redistribute instances
          across zones.

        * PROACTIVE - The managed instance group proactively redistributes
          instances to meet its target distribution.

    TYPE must be one of: NONE, PROACTIVE.

     --remove-stateful-disks=DEVICE_NAME,[DEVICE_NAME,...]
        Stop considering the disks stateful by the instance group.

     --stateful-disk=[auto-delete=AUTO-DELETE],[device-name=DEVICE-NAME]
        Disks considered stateful by the instance group. Managed instance
        groups preserve and reattach stateful disks on VM autohealing, update,
        and recreate events.

        Use this argument multiple times to update more disks.

        If stateful disk with given device-name exists in current instance
        config, its properties will be replaced by the newly provided ones. In
        other case new stateful disk definition will be added to the instance
        config.

         device-name
            (Requied) Device name of the disk to mark stateful.

         auto-delete
            (Optional) Specifies the auto deletion policy of the stateful disk.
            Supported values are never (never delete this disk) and
            on-permanent-instance-deletion (delete the stateful disk when the
            given instance is permanently deleted from the instance group; for
            example when the group is resized down). If omitted, never is used
            as the default.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --clear-autohealing
          Clears all autohealing policy fields for the managed instance group.

       --initial-delay=INITIAL_DELAY
          Specifies the length of time during which the instance is known to be
          initializing and should not be autohealed even if unhealthy. This
          value cannot be greater than 1 hour. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for
          information on duration formats.

       At most one of these may be specified:

         --health-check=HEALTH_CHECK
            Name of the health check to operate on.

         --http-health-check=HTTP_HEALTH_CHECK
            (DEPRECATED) HTTP health check object used for autohealing
            instances in this group.

            HttpHealthCheck is deprecated. Use --health-check instead.

         --https-health-check=HTTPS_HEALTH_CHECK
            (DEPRECATED) HTTPS health check object used for autohealing
            instances in this group.

            HttpsHealthCheck is deprecated. Use --health-check instead.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the managed instance group to update. If not specified, you
          may be prompted to select a region.

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the managed instance group to update. If not specified, you
          may be prompted to select a zone.

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
          invocation.
