NAME
    gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed delete-instances - delete
        instances managed by managed instance group

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed delete-instances NAME
        --instances=INSTANCE,[INSTANCE,...] [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed delete-instances is used
    to delete one or more instances from a managed instance group. Once the
    instances are deleted, the size of the group is automatically reduced to
    reflect the changes.

    If you would like to keep the underlying virtual machines but still remove
    them from the managed instance group, use the abandon-instances command
    instead.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the managed instance group to operate on.

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified,
          you may be prompted to select a zone.
