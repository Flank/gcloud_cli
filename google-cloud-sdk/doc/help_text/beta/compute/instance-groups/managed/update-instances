NAME
    gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed update-instances - immediately
        update selected instances in a Google Compute Engine managed instance
        group

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed update-instances NAME
        --instances=INSTANCE,[INSTANCE,...]
        [--minimal-action=MINIMAL_ACTION; default="none"]
        [--most-disruptive-allowed-action=MOST_DISRUPTIVE_ALLOWED_ACTION;
          default="replace"] [--region=REGION | --zone=ZONE]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) When using a managed instance group, it's possible that your
    intended specification for a VM is different from the current state of that
    VM. For example, this can happen due to changes to the group's target
    instance template. This command enables you to initiate the update process
    on the given set of instances instantly, thus when your Managed Instance
    Group is stable you can be sure that all the changes were applied.

    gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed update-instances allows you to
    specify the least and the most disruptive actions that can be performed
    while updating the instances. This way you can reduce the risk of rolling
    out too many changes at once. Possible actions are: none, refresh, restart
    and replace. The level of disruption to the instance is ordered as: none <
    refresh < restart < replace.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the managed instance group to operate on.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --instances=INSTANCE,[INSTANCE,...]
        Names of instances to update.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --minimal-action=MINIMAL_ACTION; default="none"
        Perform at least this action on each instance while updating.
        MINIMAL_ACTION must be one of:

         none
            No action
         refresh
            Apply properties that are possible to apply without stopping the
            instance
         replace
            Delete the instance and create it again
         restart
            Stop the instance and start it again

     --most-disruptive-allowed-action=MOST_DISRUPTIVE_ALLOWED_ACTION; default="replace"
        Perform at most this action on each instance while updating. If the
        update requires a more disruptive action than the one specified here,
        then the update will fail and no changes will be made.
        MOST_DISRUPTIVE_ALLOWED_ACTION must be one of:

         none
            No action
         refresh
            Apply properties that are possible to apply without stopping the
            instance
         replace
            Delete the instance and create it again
         restart
            Stop the instance and start it again

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Region of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified,
          you may be prompted to select a region.

          A list of regions can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute regions list

          Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command
          invocation.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified,
          you may be prompted to select a zone.

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command
          invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To update instances instance-1, instance-2 in my-group, with
    minimal-action=none and most-disruptive-allowed-action=restart, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute instance-groups managed update-instances \
              my-group --instances=instance-1,instance2 \
              --minimal-action=none
              --most-disruptive-allowed-action=restart

NOTES
    This command is currently in BETA and may change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute instance-groups managed update-instances
        $ gcloud alpha compute instance-groups managed update-instances
