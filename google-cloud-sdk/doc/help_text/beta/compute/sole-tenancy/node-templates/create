DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Create a Compute Engine node template.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the node templates to operate on.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --node-requirements=[localSSD=LOCALSSD],[memory=MEMORY],[vCPU=VCPU]
          The requirements for nodes. Google Compute Engine will automatically
          choose a node type that fits the requirements on Node Group creation.
          If multiple node types match your defined criteria, the NodeType with
          the least amount of each resource will be selected. You can specify
          'any' to indicate any non-zero value for a certain resource.

          The following keys are allowed:

           vCPU
              The number of committed cores available to the node.

           memory
              The amount of memory available to the node. This value should
              include unit (eg. 3072MB or 9GB). If no units are specified, MB
              is assumed.

           localSSD
              Optional. The amount of SSD space available on the node. This
              value should include unit (eg. 3072MB or 9GB). If no units are
              specified, GB is assumed. If this key is not specified, local SSD
              is unconstrained.

       --node-type=NODE_TYPE
          The node type to use for nodes in node groups using this template.
          The type of a node determines what resources are available to
          instances running on the node.

          See the following for more information:

              $ gcloud beta compute sole-tenancy node-types list

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --cpu-overcommit-type=CPU_OVERCOMMIT_TYPE
        CPU overcommit type for nodes created based on this template. To
        overcommit CPUs on a VM, set --cpu-overcommit-type equal to either
        standard or none, and then when creating a VM, specify a value for the
        --min-node-cpu flag. Lower values for --min-node-cpu specify a higher
        overcommit ratio, that is, proportionally more vCPUs in relation to
        physical CPUs. You can only overcommit CPUs on VMs that are scheduled
        on nodes that support it. CPU_OVERCOMMIT_TYPE must be one of: enabled,
        none.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional description of this resource.

     --node-affinity-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        Labels to use for node affinity, which will be used in instance
        scheduling. This corresponds to the --node-affinity flag on compute
        instances create and compute instance-templates create.

     --region=REGION
        Region of the node templates to operate on. If not specified, you may
        be prompted to select a region.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     --server-binding=SERVER_BINDING; default="restart-node-on-any-server"
        The server binding policy for nodes using this template, which
        determines where the nodes should restart following a maintenance
        event. SERVER_BINDING must be one of:

         restart-node-on-any-server
            Nodes using this template will restart on any physical server
            following a maintenance event.
         restart-node-on-minimal-servers
            Nodes using this template will restart on the same physical server
            following a maintenance event, instead of being live migrated to or
            restarted on a new physical server. This means that VMs on such
            nodes will experience outages while maintenance is applied. This
            option may be useful if you are using software licenses tied to the
            underlying server characteristics such as physical sockets or
            cores, to avoid the need for additional licenses when maintenance
            occurs.

            Note that in some cases, Google Compute Engine may need to move
            your VMs to a new underlying server. During these situations your
            VMs will be restarted on a new physical server and assigned a new
            sole tenant physical server ID.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To create a node template of type n1-node-96-624, run:

        $ gcloud beta compute sole-tenancy node-templates create \
            my-node-template --node-type=n1-node-96-624

NOTES
    This command is currently in BETA and may change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute sole-tenancy node-templates create
        $ gcloud alpha compute sole-tenancy node-templates create
