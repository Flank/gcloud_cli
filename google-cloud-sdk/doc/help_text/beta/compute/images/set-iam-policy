NAME
    gcloud beta compute images set-iam-policy - set IAM policy for a disk image

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute images set-iam-policy IMAGE_NAME POLICY_FILE
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute images set-iam-policy replaces the existing IAM
    policy for a disk image, given an image and a file encoded in JSON or YAML
    that contains the IAM policy. If the given policy file specifies an "etag"
    value, then the replacement will succeed only if the policy already in
    place matches that etag. (An etag obtained via get-iam-policy will prevent
    the replacement if the policy for the image has been subsequently updated.)
    A policy file that does not contain an etag value will replace any existing
    policy for the image.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     IMAGE_NAME
        Name of the disk image to set the IAM policy of.

     POLICY_FILE
        JSON or YAML file containing the IAM policy.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    The following command will read an IAM policy defined in a JSON file
    'policy.json' and set it for a disk image with identifier 'my-image'

        $ gcloud beta compute images set-iam-policy my-image policy.json

    See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details of the
    policy file format and contents.

NOTES
    This command is currently in BETA and may change without notice. This
    variant is also available:

        $ gcloud alpha compute images set-iam-policy
