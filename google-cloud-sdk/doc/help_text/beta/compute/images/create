DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute images create is used to create custom disk
    images. The resulting image can be provided during instance or disk
    creation so that the instance attached to the resulting disks has access to
    a known set of software or files from the image.

    Images can be created from gzipped compressed tarball containing raw disk
    data, existing disks in any zone, existing images, and existing snapshots
    inside the same project.

    Images are global resources, so they can be used across zones and projects.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     IMAGE_NAME
        The name of the disk image to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --source-disk=SOURCE_DISK
          A source disk to create the image from. The value for this option can
          be the name of a disk with the zone specified via --source-disk-zone
          flag.

       --source-image=SOURCE_IMAGE
          The name of an image to clone. May be used with
          --source-image-project to clone an image in a different project.

       --source-image-family=SOURCE_IMAGE_FAMILY
          The family of the source image. This will cause the latest non-
          deprecated image in the family to be used as the source image. May be
          used with --source-image-project to refer to an image family in a
          different project.

       --source-snapshot=SOURCE_SNAPSHOT
          A source snapshot to create the image from. The value for this option
          can be the name of a snapshot within the same project as the
          destination image.

       --source-uri=SOURCE_URI
          The full Google Cloud Storage URI where the disk image is stored.
          This file must be a gzip-compressed tarball whose name ends in
          .tar.gz.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --csek-key-file=FILE
        Path to a Customer-Supplied Encryption Key (CSEK) key file, mapping
        Google Compute Engine images to user managed keys to be used when
        creating, mounting, or snapshotting disks.

        If you pass - as value of the flag the CSEK will be read from stdin.
        See
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-supplied-encryption
        for more details.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        An optional, textual description for the image being created.

     --family=FAMILY
        The family of the image. When creating an instance or disk, specifying
        a family will cause the latest non-deprecated image in the family to be
        used.

     --force
        By default, image creation fails when it is created from a disk that is
        attached to a running instance. When this flag is used, image creation
        from disk will proceed even if the disk is in use.

     --force-create
        (DEPRECATED) DEPRECATED, use --force instead. By default, image
        creation fails when it is created from a disk that is attached to a
        running instance. When this flag is used, image creation from disk will
        proceed even if the disk is in use.

        Flag force-create is deprecated. Use --force instead.

     --guest-os-features=[GUEST_OS_FEATURE,...]
        This parameter enables one or more features for VM instances that use
        the image for their boot disks. The following features are available:

        * MULTI_IP_SUBNET - For configuring interfaces with a netmask other
          than /32.

        * SECURE_BOOT - Enables UEFI secure boot, which restrics unsigned
          software from booting or unsigned drivers from loading on the VM
          instance.

        * UEFI_COMPATIBLE - Enables UEFI booting, which is an alternative
          system boot method. Most public images use the GRUB bootloader as
          their primary boot method.

        * VIRTIO_SCSI_MULTIQUEUE - Enables multiqueue SCSI capabilities for
          Local SSD devices. This option is an alternative to NVMe.
          + For Linux images, you can enable VIRTIO_SCSI_MULTIQUEUE on images
            with kernel versions 3.17 and higher.
          + For Windows images, you can enable VIRTIO_SCSI_MULTIQUEUE on
            images with driver version 1.2.0.1621 or higher.

        * WINDOWS - Required for Windows Server images. Newer public images
          for Windows server include the WINDOWS parameter to indicate that it
          is a Windows image.

    GUEST_OS_FEATURE must be one of: MULTI_IP_SUBNET, SECURE_BOOT,
    UEFI_COMPATIBLE, VIRTIO_SCSI_MULTIQUEUE, WINDOWS.

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        A list of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

     --licenses=[LICENSES,...]
        Comma-separated list of URIs to license resources.

     --require-csek-key-create
        Refuse to create images not protected by a user managed key in the key
        file when --csek-key-file is given. This behavior is enabled by default
        to prevent incorrect gcloud invocations from accidentally creating
        images with no user managed key. Disabling the check allows creation of
        some images without a matching Customer-Supplied Encryption Key in the
        supplied --csek-key-file. See
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-supplied-encryption
        for more details. Enabled by default, use --no-require-csek-key-create
        to disable.

     --source-disk-zone=SOURCE_DISK_ZONE
        The zone of the source disk to operate on. If not specified and the
        compute/zone property isn't set, you will be prompted to select a zone.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

     --source-image-project=SOURCE_IMAGE_PROJECT
        The project name of the source image. Must also specify either
        --source-image or --source-image-family when using this flag.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in BETA and may change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute images create
        $ gcloud alpha compute images create
