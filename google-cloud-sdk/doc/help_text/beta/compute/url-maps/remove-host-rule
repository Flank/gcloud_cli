NAME
    gcloud beta compute url-maps remove-host-rule - remove a host rule from a
        URL map

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute url-maps remove-host-rule URL_MAP_NAME --host=HOST
        [--delete-orphaned-path-matcher] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute url-maps remove-host-rule is used to remove a
    host rule from a URL map. When a host rule is removed, its path matcher is
    only removed if it is not referenced by any other host rules and
    --delete-orphaned-path-matcher is provided.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     URL_MAP_NAME
        Name of the URL map to operate on.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --host=HOST
        One of the hosts in the host rule to remove.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --delete-orphaned-path-matcher
        If provided and a path matcher is orphaned as a result of this command,
        the command removes the orphaned path matcher instead of failing.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,

    details.

    named MY-URL-MAP, you can use this command:

        $ gcloud beta compute url-maps remove-host-rule MY-URL-MAP \
