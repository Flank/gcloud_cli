NAME
    gcloud beta compute vpn-gateways describe - describe a Google Compute
        Engine Highly Available VPN Gateway

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute vpn-gateways describe NAME [--region=REGION]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute vpn-gateways describe is used to display all
    data associated with a Google Compute Engine Highly Available VPN Gateway
    in a project.

    High Available VPN Gateway provides a means to create a VPN solution with a
    higher availability SLA compared to Classic Target VPN Gateway. High
    Available VPN gateways are referred to as simply VPN gateways in the API
    documentation and gcloud commands. A VPN Gateway can reference one or more
    VPN tunnels that connect it to external VPN gateways or Cloud VPN Gateways.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the VPN Gateway to describe.

FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        Region of the VPN Gateway to describe. If not specified, you may be
        prompted to select a region.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in BETA and may change without notice. This
    variant is also available:

        $ gcloud alpha compute vpn-gateways describe
