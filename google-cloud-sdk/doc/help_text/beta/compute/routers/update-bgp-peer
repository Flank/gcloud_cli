DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute routers update-bgp-peer is used to update a BGP
    peer on a Compute Engine router.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the router to operate on.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --peer-name=PEER_NAME
        The name of the new BGP peer being updated.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --advertised-route-priority=ADVERTISED_ROUTE_PRIORITY
        The priority of routes advertised to this BGP peer. In the case where
        there is more than one matching route of maximum length, the routes
        with lowest priority value win. 0 <= priority <= 65535. If not
        specified, will use Google-managed priorities.

     --advertisement-mode=MODE
        The new advertisement mode for this peer. MODE must be one of:

         CUSTOM
            Custom (user-configured) BGP advertisements.
         DEFAULT
            Default (Google-managed) BGP advertisements.

     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --interface=INTERFACE
        The name of the interface for this BGP peer.

     --ip-address=IP_ADDRESS
        The link-local address of the Cloud Router interface for this BGP peer.
        Must be a link-local IPv4 address belonging to the range 169.254.0.0/16
        and must belong to same subnet as the interface address of the peer
        router.

     --peer-asn=PEER_ASN
        The BGP autonomous system number (ASN) for this BGP peer. Must be a
        16-bit or 32-bit private ASN as defined in
        https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6996, for example --asn=64512.

     --peer-ip-address=PEER_IP_ADDRESS
        The link-local address of the peer router. Must be a link-local IPv4
        address belonging to the range 169.254.0.0/16.

     --region=REGION
        Region of the router to operate on. If not specified, you may be
        prompted to select a region.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

     --set-advertisement-groups=[GROUP,...]
        The list of pre-defined groups of IP ranges to dynamically advertise on
        this peer. This list can only be specified in custom advertisement
        mode.

        GROUP must be (currently only one value is supported):

         ALL_SUBNETS
            Automatically advertise all available subnets.

     --set-advertisement-ranges=[CIDR_RANGE=DESC,...]
        The list of individual IP ranges, in CIDR format, to dynamically
        advertise on this peer. Each IP range can (optionally) be given a text
        description DESC. For example, to advertise a specific range, use
        --set-advertisement-ranges=192.168.10.0/24. To store a description with
        the range, use --set-advertisement-ranges=192.168.10.0/24=my-networks.
        This list can only be specified in custom advertisement mode.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --add-advertisement-groups=[GROUP,...]
          A list of pre-defined groups of IP ranges to dynamically advertise on
          this peer. This list is appended to any existing advertisements. This
          field can only be specified in custom advertisement mode.

          GROUP must be (currently only one value is supported):

           ALL_SUBNETS
              Automatically advertise all available subnets.

       --add-advertisement-ranges=[CIDR_RANGE=DESC,...]
          A list of individual IP ranges, in CIDR format, to dynamically
          advertise on this peer. This list is appended to any existing
          advertisements. Each IP range can (optionally) be given a text
          description DESC. For example, to advertise a specific range, use
          --advertisement-ranges=192.168.10.0/24. To store a description with
          the range, use --advertisement-ranges=192.168.10.0/24=my-networks.
          This list can only be specified in custom advertisement mode.

       --remove-advertisement-groups=[GROUP,...]
          A list of pre-defined groups of IP ranges to remove from dynamic
          advertisement on this peer. Each group in the list must exist in the
          current set of custom advertisements. This field can only be
          specified in custom advertisement mode.

          GROUP must be (currently only one value is supported):

           ALL_SUBNETS
              Automatically advertise all available subnets.

       --remove-advertisement-ranges=[CIDR_RANGE,...]
          A list of individual IP ranges, in CIDR format, to remove from
          dynamic advertisement on this peer. Each IP range in the list must
          exist in the current set of custom advertisements. This field can
          only be specified in custom advertisement mode.
