NAME
    gcloud beta compute routers nats delete - remove a NAT from a Compute
        Engine router

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute routers nats delete NAME [NAME ...] --router=ROUTER
        [--region=REGION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute routers nats delete is used to delete a NAT on a
    Compute Engine router.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME [NAME ...]
        Name of the NATs to delete

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --router=ROUTER
        The Router to use for NAT.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        Region of the NATs to delete. If not specified, you may be prompted to
        select a region.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To delete NAT 'n1' in router 'r1', run:

        $ gcloud beta compute routers nats delete n1 --router=r1 \
            --region=us-central1

NOTES
    This command is currently in BETA and may change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute routers nats delete
        $ gcloud alpha compute routers nats delete
