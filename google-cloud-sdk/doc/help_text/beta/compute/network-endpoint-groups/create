NAME
    gcloud beta compute network-endpoint-groups create - creates a Google
        Compute Engine network endpoint group

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute network-endpoint-groups create NAME
        [--default-port=DEFAULT_PORT] [--network=NETWORK] [--subnet=SUBNET]
        [--zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Creates a Google Compute Engine network endpoint group.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the network endpoint group to operate on.

FLAGS
     --default-port=DEFAULT_PORT
        The default port to use if the port number is not specified in the
        network endpoint.

        If this flag isn't specified, then every network endpoint in the
        network endpoint group must have a port specified.

     --network=NETWORK
        Name of the network in which the NEG is created. default project
        network is used if unspecified.

     --subnet=SUBNET
        Name of the subnet to which all network endpoints belong.

        If not specified, network endpoints may belong to any subnetwork in the
        region where the network endpoint group is created.

     --zone=ZONE
        Zone of the network endpoint group to operate on. If not specified and
        the compute/zone property isn't set, you may be prompted to select a
        zone.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/zone property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

        A list of zones can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute zones list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in BETA and may change without notice. This
    variant is also available:

        $ gcloud alpha compute network-endpoint-groups create
