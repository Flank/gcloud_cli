NAME
    gcloud beta compute network-endpoint-groups delete - delete a Google
        Compute Engine network endpoint group

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute network-endpoint-groups delete NAME
        [--global | --zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Delete a Google Compute Engine network endpoint group.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the network endpoint group to operate on.

FLAGS
     At most one of these may be specified:

       --global
          If set, the network endpoint group is global.

       --zone=ZONE
          Zone of the network endpoint group to operate on. If not specified
          and the compute/zone property isn't set, you may be prompted to
          select a zone.

          To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
          compute/zone property:

              $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

          A list of zones can be fetched by running:

              $ gcloud compute zones list

          To unset the property, run:

              $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

          Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
          CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
