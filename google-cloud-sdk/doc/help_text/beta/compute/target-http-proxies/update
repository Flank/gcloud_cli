NAME
    gcloud beta compute target-http-proxies update - update a target HTTP proxy

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta compute target-http-proxies update NAME --url-map=URL_MAP
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta compute target-http-proxies update is used to change the
    URL map of existing target HTTP proxies. A target HTTP proxy is referenced
    by one or more forwarding rules which define which packets the proxy is
    responsible for routing. The target HTTP proxy in turn points to a URL map
    that defines the rules for routing the requests. The URL map's job is to
    map URLs to backend services which handle the actual requests.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        Name of the target HTTP proxy to update.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --url-map=URL_MAP
        A reference to a URL map resource that defines the mapping of URLs to
        backend services. The URL map must exist and cannot be deleted while
        referenced by a target HTTP proxy.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.
