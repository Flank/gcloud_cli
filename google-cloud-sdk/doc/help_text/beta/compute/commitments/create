DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Create Google Compute Engine commitments.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     COMMITMENT
        The name of the commitment to create.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --plan=PLAN
        Duration of the commitment. PLAN must be one of: 12-month, 36-month.

     --resources=[RESOURCE=COMMITMENT,...]
        Resources to be included in the commitment commitment:
        * MEMORY should include unit (eg. 3072MB or 9GB). If no units are
          specified, GB is assumed.
        * VCPU is number of commited cores.
    Ratio between number of VCPU cores and memory must conform to limits
    described on:
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/creating-instance-with-custom-machine-type

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --region=REGION
        The region of the commitment to create. If not specified, you may be
        prompted to select a region.

        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
        compute/region property:

            $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

        A list of regions can be fetched by running:

            $ gcloud compute regions list

        To unset the property, run:

            $ gcloud config unset compute/region

        Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    This command is currently in BETA and may change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud compute commitments create
        $ gcloud alpha compute commitments create
