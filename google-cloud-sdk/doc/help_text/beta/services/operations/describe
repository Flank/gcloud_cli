NAME
    gcloud beta services operations describe - describes an operation resource
        for a given operation name

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta services operations describe OPERATION [--full=FULL]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) This command will return information about an operation given the
    name of that operation.

    The amount of information inside an operation can be very large, so by
    default, only a summary is returned. If you want the entire operation
    resource, you can include the --full flag.

    Note that the operations/ prefix of the operation name is optional and may
    be omitted.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     OPERATION
        The name of the operation to describe.

FLAGS
     --full=FULL
        (DEPRECATED) Print the entire operation resource, which could be large.
        By default, a summary will be printed instead.

        This flag is deprecated.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To describe an operation resource named
    operations/serviceConfigs.my-service.1, run:

        $ gcloud beta services operations describe \
            serviceConfigs.my-service.1

    To get the full operation resource, run:

        $ gcloud beta services operations describe \
            serviceConfigs.my-service.1 --full
