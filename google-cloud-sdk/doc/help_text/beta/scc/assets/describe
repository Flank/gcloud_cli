       --asset=ASSET
          Cloud SCC specific asset. It's derived from the the asset's relative

          For Example, for the given asset name:
          "organizations/123/assets/456", 456 represents asset id.

       --resource-name=RESOURCE_NAME
          Asset's resource name. Full resource name of the Google Cloud
          Platform resource this asset represents. This field is immutable

          For Example:
          "//cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/1234567890123" could
