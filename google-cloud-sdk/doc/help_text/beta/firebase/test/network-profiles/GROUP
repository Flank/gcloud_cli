NAME
    gcloud beta firebase test network-profiles - explore network profiles
        available for testing

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta firebase test network-profiles COMMAND [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) A network traffic profile consists of a set of parameters to emulate
    network conditions when running a test. This feature only works on physical
    devices. The network shaping parameters are:

      o RULE: Where to apply traffic shaping. The UP rule shapes the
        connection from the device to the internet. The DOWN rule shapes the
        connection from the internet to the device.
      o DELAY: The delay in packet transmission, in ms.
      o LOSS_RATIO: The ratio of packets dropped during transmission.
      o DUPLICATION_RATIO: The ratio of packets duplicated during
        transmission.
      o BANDWIDTH: The average packet transmission rate in kbits/s, as
        defined by the token bucket algorithm.
      o BURST: The total size, in kbits, by which packets can exceed the
        bandwidth, as defined by the token bucket algorithm.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.
