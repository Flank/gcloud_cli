DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Create or update a Google Cloud Function.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Function resource - The Cloud function name to deploy. The arguments in
     this group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE)
     Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in
     other ways. To set the [project] attribute: provide the argument [NAME] on
     the command line with a fully specified name; provide the argument
     [--project] on the command line; set the property [core/project]. This
     must be specified.

       NAME
          ID of the function or fully qualified identifier for the function.
          This positional must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --region=REGION
          The Cloud region for the function. Overrides the default
          functions/region property value for this command invocation.

FLAGS
     --allow-unauthenticated
        If set, makes this a public function. This will allow all callers,
        without checking authentication.

     --entry-point=ENTRY_POINT
        Name of a Google Cloud Function (as defined in source code) that will
        be executed. Defaults to the resource name suffix, if not specified.
        For backward compatibility, if function with given name is not found,
        then the system will try to use function named "function". For Node.js
        this is name of a function exported by the module specified in
        source_location.

     --ignore-file=IGNORE_FILE
        Override the .gcloudignore file and use the specified file instead.

     --memory=MEMORY
        Limit on the amount of memory the function can use.

        Allowed values are: 128MB, 256MB, 512MB, 1024MB, and 2048MB. By
        default, a new function is limited to 256MB of memory. When deploying
        an update to an existing function, the function will keep its old
        memory limit unless you specify this flag.

     --retry
        If specified, then the function will be retried in case of a failure.

     --runtime=RUNTIME
        Runtime in which to run the function.

        Required when deploying a new function; optional when updating an
        existing function.

        Choices:

        * nodejs8: Node.js 8
        * nodejs10: Node.js 10
        * python37: Python 3.7
        * go111: Go 1.11
        * nodejs6: Node.js 6 (deprecated)

     --service-account=SERVICE_ACCOUNT
        The email address of the IAM service account associated with the
        function at runtime. The service account represents the identity of the
        running function, and determines what permissions the function has.

        If not provided, the function will use the project's default service
        account.

     --source=SOURCE
        Location of source code to deploy.

        Location of the source can be one of the following three options:

        * Source code in Google Cloud Storage (must be a .zip archive),
        * Reference to source repository or,
        * Local filesystem path (root directory of function source).

    Note that if you do not specify the --source flag:

      o Current directory will be used for new function deployments.
      o If the function is previously deployed using a local filesystem path,
    then function's source code will be updated using the current directory.
      o If the function is previously deployed using a Google Cloud Storage
    location or a source repository, then the function's source code will not
    be updated.

    The value of the flag will be interpreted as a Cloud Storage location, if
    it starts with gs://.

    The value will be interpreted as a reference to a source repository, if it
    starts with https://.

    Otherwise, it will be interpreted as the local filesystem path. When
    deploying source from the local filesystem, this command skips files
    specified in the .gcloudignore file (see gcloud topic gcloudignore for more
    information). If the .gcloudignore file doesn't exist, the command will try
    to create it.

    The minimal source repository URL is:
    https://source.developers.google.com/projects/${PROJECT}/repos/${REPO}

    By using the URL above, sources from the root directory of the repository
    on the revision tagged master will be used.

    If you want to deploy from a revision different from master, append one of
    the following three sources to the URL:

      o /revisions/${REVISION},
      o /moveable-aliases/${MOVEABLE_ALIAS},
      o /fixed-aliases/${FIXED_ALIAS}.

    If you'd like to deploy sources from a directory different from the root,
    you must specify a revision, a moveable alias, or a fixed alias, as above,
    and append /paths/${PATH_TO_SOURCES_DIRECTORY} to the URL.

    Overall, the URL should match the following regular expression:

        ^https://source\.developers\.google\.com/projects/
        (?<accountId>[^/]+)/repos/(?<repoName>[^/]+)
        (((/revisions/(?<commit>[^/]+))|(/moveable-aliases/(?<branch>[^/]+))|
        (/fixed-aliases/(?<tag>[^/]+)))(/paths/(?<path>.*))?)?$

    An example of a validly formatted source repository URL is:

        https://source.developers.google.com/projects/123456789/repos/testrepo/
        moveable-aliases/alternate-branch/paths/path-to=source

     --stage-bucket=STAGE_BUCKET
        When deploying a function from a local directory, this flag's value is
        the name of the Google Cloud Storage bucket in which source code will
        be stored. Note that if you set the --stage-bucket flag when deploying
        a function, you will need to specify --source or --stage-bucket in
        subsequent deployments to update your source code. To use this flag
        successfully, the account in use must have permissions to write to this
        bucket. For help granting access, refer to this guide:
        https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/

     --timeout=TIMEOUT
        The function execution timeout, e.g. 30s for 30 seconds. Defaults to
        original value for existing function or 60 seconds for new functions.
        Cannot be more than 540s. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information
        on duration formats.

     --update-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to update. If a label exists its value is
        modified, otherwise a new label is created.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

        Label keys starting with deployment are reserved for use by deployment
        tools and cannot be specified manually.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --clear-env-vars
          Remove all environment variables.

       --env-vars-file=FILE_PATH
          Path to a local YAML file with definitions for all environment
          variables. All existing environment variables will be removed before
          the new environment variables are added.

       --set-env-vars=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          List of key-value pairs to set as environment variables. All existing
          environment variables will be removed first.

       Only --update-env-vars and --remove-env-vars can be used together. If
       both are specified, --remove-env-vars will be applied first.

         --remove-env-vars=[KEY,...]
            List of environment variables to be removed.

         --update-env-vars=[KEY=VALUE,...]
            List of key-value pairs to set as environment variables.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --clear-labels
          Remove all labels. If --update-labels is also specified then
          --clear-labels is applied first.

          For example, to remove all labels:

              $ gcloud beta functions deploy --clear-labels

          To set the labels to exactly "foo" and "baz":

              $ gcloud beta functions deploy --clear-labels \
                --update-labels foo=bar,baz=qux

       --remove-labels=[KEY,...]
          List of label keys to remove. If a label does not exist it is
          silently ignored.Label keys starting with deployment are reserved for
          use by deployment tools and cannot be specified manually.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --clear-max-instances
          Clears the maximum instances setting for the function.

       --max-instances=MAX_INSTANCES
          Sets the maximum number of instances for the function. A function
          execution that would exceed max-instances times out.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --clear-vpc-connector
          Clears the VPC connector field.

       --vpc-connector=VPC_CONNECTOR
          The VPC Access connector that the function can connect to. It can be
          either the fully-qualified URI, or the short name of the VPC Access
          connector resource. If the short name is used, the connector must
          belong to the same project. The format of this field is either
          projects/${PROJECT}/locations/${LOCATION}/connectors/${CONNECTOR} or
          ${CONNECTOR}, where ${CONNECTOR} is the short name of the VPC Access
          connector.

     If you don't specify a trigger when deploying an update to an existing
     function it will keep its current trigger. You must specify
     --trigger-topic, --trigger-bucket, --trigger-http or (--trigger-event AND
     --trigger-resource) when deploying a new function. At most one of these
     may be specified:

       --trigger-bucket=TRIGGER_BUCKET
          Google Cloud Storage bucket name. Every change in files in this
          bucket will trigger function execution.

       --trigger-http
          Function will be assigned an endpoint, which you can view by using
          the describe command. Any HTTP request (of a supported type) to the
          endpoint will trigger function execution. Supported HTTP request
          types are: POST, PUT, GET, DELETE, and OPTIONS.

       --trigger-topic=TRIGGER_TOPIC
          Name of Pub/Sub topic. Every message published in this topic will
          trigger function execution with message contents passed as input
          data.

       --trigger-event=EVENT_TYPE
          Specifies which action should trigger the function. For a list of
          acceptable values, call gcloud functions event-types list.

       --trigger-resource=RESOURCE
          Specifies which resource from --trigger-event is being observed. E.g.
          if --trigger-event is
          providers/cloud.storage/eventTypes/object.change, --trigger-resource
          must be a bucket name. For a list of expected resources, call gcloud
          functions event-types list.
