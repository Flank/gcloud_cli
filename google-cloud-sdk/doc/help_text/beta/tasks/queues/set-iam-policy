NAME
    gcloud beta tasks queues set-iam-policy - set IAM policy for a queue

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta tasks queues set-iam-policy QUEUE POLICY_FILE
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) This command replaces the existing IAM policy for a queue, given a
    queue and a file encoded in JSON or YAML that contains the IAM policy. If
    the given policy file specifies an "etag" value, then the replacement will
    succeed only if the policy already in place matches that etag. (An etag
    obtained via get-iam-policy will prevent the replacement if the policy for
    the queue has been subsequently updated.) A policy file that does not
    contain an etag value will replace any existing policy for the queue.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     QUEUE
        The queue to set the IAM policy for.

     POLICY_FILE
        JSON or YAML file containing the IAM policy.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    The following command will read an IAM policy defined in a JSON file
    'policy.json' and set it for a queue with identifier 'my-queue'

        $ gcloud beta tasks queues set-iam-policy my-queue policy.json

    See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details of the
    policy file format and contents.

NOTES
    This command is currently in BETA and may change without notice. This
    variant is also available:

        $ gcloud alpha tasks queues set-iam-policy
