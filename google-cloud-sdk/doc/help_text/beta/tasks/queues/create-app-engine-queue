DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) An App Engine queue is a push queue sent to an App Engine endpoint.
    The flags available to this command represent the fields of an App Engine
    queue that are mutable.

    If you have early access to Cloud Tasks, refer to the following guide for
    more information about the different queue target types:

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     QUEUE
        The queue to create.

FLAGS
     --max-attempts=MAX_ATTEMPTS
        The maximum number of attempts per task in the queue.

     --max-backoff=MAX_BACKOFF
        The maximum amount of time to wait before retrying a task after it
        fails. Must be a string that ends in 's', such as "5s".

     --max-concurrent-tasks=MAX_CONCURRENT_TASKS
        The maximum number of concurrent tasks that Cloud Tasks allows to be
        dispatched for this queue. After this threshold has been reached, Cloud
        Tasks stops dispatching tasks until the number of outstanding requests
        decreases.

     --max-doublings=MAX_DOUBLINGS
        The time between retries will double maxDoublings times.

        A tasks retry interval starts at minBackoff, then doubles maxDoublings
        times, then increases linearly, and finally retries retries at
        intervals of maxBackoff up to maxAttempts times.

        For example, if minBackoff is 10s, maxBackoff is 300s, and maxDoublings
        is 3, then the a task will first be retried in 10s. The retry interval
        will double three times, and then increase linearly by 2^3 * 10s.
        Finally, the task will retry at intervals of maxBackoff until the task
        has been attempted maxAttempts times. Thus, the requests will retry at
        10s, 20s, 40s, 80s, 160s, 240s, 300s, 300s.

     --max-retry-duration=MAX_RETRY_DURATION
        The time limit for retrying a failed task, measured from when the task
        was first run. Once the --max-retry-duration time has passed and the
        task has been attempted --max-attempts times, no further attempts will
        be made and the task will be deleted.

        Must be a string that ends in 's', such as "5s".

     --max-tasks-dispatched-per-second=MAX_TASKS_DISPATCHED_PER_SECOND
        The maximum rate at which tasks are dispatched from this queue.

     --min-backoff=MIN_BACKOFF
        The minimum amount of time to wait before retrying a task after it
        fails. Must be a string that ends in 's', such as "5s".

     --routing-override=KEY:VALUE,[...]
        If provided, the specified route is used for all tasks in the queue, no
        matter what is set is at the task-level.

        KEY must be at least one of: [service, version, instance]. Any missing
        keys will use the default.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.
