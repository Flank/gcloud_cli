NAME
    gcloud beta service-management operations list - list operations for a
        project

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta service-management operations list [--filter=EXPRESSION]
        [--service=SERVICE] [--limit=LIMIT] [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE]
        [--sort-by=[FIELD,...]] [--uri] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) (REMOVED) List operations for a project.

    The service-management operations list command has been replaced by
    endpoints operations list and services operations list.

    This command will list operations for a service, optionally matching a
    particular filter.

FLAGS
     --filter=EXPRESSION
        Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates as True then that item is listed.

        The available filter fields are startTime and done. Unrecognized fields
        will cause an error.

        startTime is an ISO 8601 datetime and supports >=, >, <=, and <
        operators. The datetime value must be wrapped in quotation marks. For
        example:

            --filter 'startTime < "2017-03-20T16:02:32"'

        done is a boolean value and supports = and != operators.

     --service=SERVICE
        The name of the service for which to list operations.

LIST COMMAND FLAGS
     --limit=LIMIT
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --page-size=PAGE_SIZE
        Some services group resource list output into pages. This flag
        specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
        determined by the service if it supports paging, otherwise it is
        unlimited (no paging). Paging may be applied before or after --filter
        and --limit depending on the service.

     --sort-by=[FIELD,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: --flatten, --sort-by, --filter, --limit.

     --uri
        Print a list of resource URIs instead of the default output.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To list all operations for a service named api.endpoints.proj.appspot.com,
    run:

        $ gcloud beta service-management operations list \
            --service api.endpoints.proj.appspot.com

    To list only operations which are complete, add the --filter argument with
    a status filter:

        $ gcloud beta service-management operations list \
            --service api.endpoints.proj.appspot.com --filter 'done = true'

    To list only operations begun after a certain point in time, add the
    --filter argument with an ISO 8601 datetime startTime filter:

        $ gcloud beta service-management operations list \
            --service api.endpoints.proj.appspot.com \
            --filter 'startTime >= "2017-02-01"'
