        binding to a Cloud Bigtable Backup

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta bigtable backups add-iam-policy-binding
        (BACKUP : --cluster=CLUSTER --instance=INSTANCE) --member=MEMBER
        --role=ROLE
        [--condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          | --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Add an IAM policy binding to a Cloud Bigtable Backup. One binding
    consists of a member, a role, and an optional condition.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Backup resource - Cloud Bigtable Backup to add the IAM policy binding to.
     The arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways. To set the [project] attribute: provide the
     argument [backup] on the command line with a fully specified name; provide
     the argument [--project] on the command line; set the property
     [core/project]. This must be specified.

       BACKUP
          ID of the backup or fully qualified identifier for the backup. This
          positional must be specified if any of the other arguments in this
          group are specified.

       --cluster=CLUSTER
          The name of the Cloud Bigtable cluster.

       --instance=INSTANCE
          The name of the Cloud Bigtable instance.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --member=MEMBER
        The member to add the binding for. Should be of the form
        user|group|serviceAccount:email or domain:domain.

        Examples: user:test-user@gmail.com, group:admins@example.com,
        serviceAccount:test123@example.domain.com, or
        domain:example.domain.com.

        Can also be one of the following special values:
        * allUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone who is on the
          internet, with or without a Google account.
        * allAuthenticatedUsers - Special identifier that represents anyone
          who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account.

     --role=ROLE
        Define the role of the member.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     At most one of these may be specified:

       --condition=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          The condition of the binding to be added. When the condition is
          explicitly specified as None (--condition=None), a binding without a
          condition is added. When the condition is specified and is not None,
          --role cannot be a primitive role. Primitive roles are roles/editor,
          roles/owner, and roles/viewer.

       expression
          (Required) Expression of the condition which evaluates to True or
          False. This uses a subset of Common Expression Language syntax.

       title
          (Required) A short string describing the purpose of the expression.

       description
          (Optional) Additional description for the expression.

          NOTE: An unsatisfied condition will not allow access via this
          binding.

       --condition-from-file=CONDITION_FROM_FILE
          Path to a local JSON or YAML file that defines the condition. To see
          available fields, see the help for --condition.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To add an IAM policy binding for the role of 'roles/editor' for the user
    'test-user@gmail.com' with backup 'my-backup' in instance 'my-instance' and
    cluster 'my-cluster', run:

        $ gcloud beta bigtable backups add-iam-policy-binding my-backup \
            --instance='my-instance' --cluster='my-cluster' \
            --member='user:test-user@gmail.com' --role='roles/editor'

    To add an IAM policy binding which expires at the end of the year 2020 for
    the role of 'roles/bigtable.admin' and the user 'test-user@gmail.com' with
    backup 'my-backup' in instance 'my-instance' and cluster 'my-cluster', run:

        $ gcloud beta bigtable backups add-iam-policy-binding my-backup \
            --instance='my-instance' --cluster='my-cluster' \
            --member='user:test-user@gmail.com' \
            --role='roles/bigtable.admin' \
