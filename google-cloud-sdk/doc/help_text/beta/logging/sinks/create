NAME
    gcloud beta logging sinks create - creates a sink

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta logging sinks create SINK_NAME DESTINATION [--include-children]
        [--log-filter=LOG_FILTER]
        [--billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID | --folder=FOLDER_ID
          | --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID | --project=PROJECT_ID]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Creates a sink used to export entries from one or more logs to a
    destination. A sink exports all logs that matches --log-filter flag. An
    empty filter matches all logs. The sink's destination can be a Cloud
    Storage bucket, a BigQuery dataset, or a Cloud Pub/Sub topic. The
    destination must already exist and Stackdriver Logging must have permission
    to write to it. Log entries are exported as soon as the sink is created.
    See
    https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/export/configure_export_v2#dest-auth.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     SINK_NAME
        The name for the sink.

     DESTINATION
        The destination for the sink.

FLAGS
     --include-children
        Whether to export logs from all child projects and folders. Only
        applies to sinks for organizations and folders.

     --log-filter=LOG_FILTER
        A filter expression for the sink. If present, the filter specifies
        which log entries to export.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID
          Create a sink associated with this billing account.

       --folder=FOLDER_ID
          Create a sink associated with this folder.

       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID
          Create a sink associated with this organization.

       --project=PROJECT_ID
          Create a sink associated with this project.

          The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
          omitted, then the current project is assumed; the current project can
          be listed using gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)' and
          can be set using gcloud config set project PROJECTID.

          --project and its fallback core/project property play two roles in
          the invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate
          on. It also specifies the project for API enablement check, quota,
          and billing. To specify a different project for quota and billing,
          use --billing-project or billing/quota_project property.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.

EXAMPLES
    To export all Google Compute Engine logs to BigQuery, run:

        $ gcloud beta logging sinks create my-bq-sink \
            bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/my-project/datasets/\
        my_dataset --log-filter='resource.type="gce_instance"'

    To export "syslog" from App Engine Flexible to Cloud Storage, run:

        $ gcloud beta logging sinks create my-gcs-sink \
            storage.googleapis.com/my-bucket \
            --log-filter='logName="projects/my-project/appengine.googleapis.\
        com%2Fsyslog"'

    To export Google App Engine logs with ERROR severity, run:

        $ gcloud beta logging sinks create my-error-logs \
            bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/my-project/datasets/\
        my_dataset --log-filter='resource.type="gae_app" AND severity=ERROR'
