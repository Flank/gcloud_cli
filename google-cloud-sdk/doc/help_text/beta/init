NAME
    gcloud beta init - initialize or reinitialize gcloud

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta init [--console-only] [--skip-diagnostics]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta init launches an interactive Getting Started workflow
    for gcloud. It performs the following setup steps:

      o Authorizes gcloud and other SDK tools to access Google Cloud Platform
        using your user account credentials, or lets you select from accounts
        whose credentials are already available.
      o Sets properties in a gcloud configuration, including the current
        project and the default Google Compute Engine region and zone.

    gcloud beta init can be used for initial setup of gcloud and to create new
    or reinitialize gcloud configurations. More information can be found by
    running gcloud topic configurations.

    Properties set by gcloud beta init are local and persistent, and are not
    affected by remote changes to the project. For example, the default Compute
    Engine zone in your configuration remains stable, even if you or another
    user changes the project-level default zone in the Cloud Platform Console.

    To sync the configuration, re-run gcloud beta init

FLAGS
     --console-only
