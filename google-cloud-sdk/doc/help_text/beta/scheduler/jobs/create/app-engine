DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Create a Cloud Scheduler job with an App Engine target.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Job resource - Job to create. This represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE)
     Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in
     other ways. To set the [project] attribute: provide the argument [job] on
     the command line with a fully specified name; provide the argument
     [--project] on the command line; set the property [core/project]. To set
     the [location] attribute: provide the argument [job] on the command line
     with a fully specified name; as the location of the current project's App
     Engine App. This must be specified.

       JOB
          ID of the job or fully qualified identifier for the job.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     --schedule=SCHEDULE
        Schedule on which the job will be executed.

        As a general rule, execution n + 1 of a job will not begin until
        execution n has finished. Cloud Scheduler will never allow two
        simultaneously outstanding executions. For example, this implies that
        if the n+1 execution is scheduled to run at 16:00 but the n execution
        takes until 16:15, the n+1 execution will not start until 16:15. A
        scheduled start time will be delayed if the previous execution has not
        ended when its scheduled time occurs.

        If --retry-count > 0 and a job attempt fails, the job will be tried a
        total of --retry-count times, with exponential backoff, until the next
        scheduled start time.

        The schedule can be either of the following types:
        * Crontab: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#Overview
        * English-like schedule:
          https://cloud.google.com/scheduler/docs/quickstart#defining_the_job_schedule

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --attempt-deadline=ATTEMPT_DEADLINE
        The deadline for job attempts. If the request handler doesn't respond
        by this dealine, the request is cancelled and the attempt is marked as
        failed. For example, 20s.

     --description=DESCRIPTION
        Human-readable description of the job.

     --headers=HEADERS
        KEY=VALUE pairs of HTTP headers to include in the request. Cannot be
        repeated. For example: --headers
        Accept-Language=en-us,Accept=text/plain

     --http-method=HTTP_METHOD; default="post"
        HTTP method to use for the request. HTTP_METHOD must be one of: delete,
        get, head, post, put.

     --max-backoff=MAX_BACKOFF; default="1h"
        Maximum amount of time to wait before retrying a task after it fails.
        For example, 10m. Default is 1h.

     --max-doublings=MAX_DOUBLINGS; default=16
        Maximum number of times that the interval between failed job retries
        will be doubled before the increase becomes constant.

     --max-retry-attempts=MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS
        Number of times to retry the request if it fails or times out. Must be
        in range 0-5 inclusive. Default is 0.

     --max-retry-duration=MAX_RETRY_DURATION
        Time limit for retrying a failed task, measured from when the task was
        first run. If specified with --max-retry-attempts greater than 0, the
        task will be retried until both limits are reached. Default is 0 (which
        means unlimited).

     --min-backoff=MIN_BACKOFF; default="5s"
        Minimum amount of time to wait before retrying a task after it fails.
        For example, 10s. Default is 5s.

     --relative-url=RELATIVE_URL; default="/"
        Relative URL to use for the request (beginning with "/").

     --service=SERVICE
        ID of the App Engine service to send the request to.

     --time-zone=TIME_ZONE; default="Etc/UTC"
        Specifies the time zone to be used in interpreting --schedule. The
        value of this field must be a time zone name from the tz database
        (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database).

        Note that some time zones include a provision for daylight savings
        time. The rules for daylight saving time are determined by the chosen
        time zone.

        For UTC use the string "utc". Default is "utc".

     --version=VERSION
        Version of the App Engine service to send the request to.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --message-body=MESSAGE_BODY
          Data payload to be included as the body of the HTTP request. May only
          be given with compatible HTTP methods (PUT or POST).

       --message-body-from-file=MESSAGE_BODY_FROM_FILE
          Path to file containing the data payload to be included as the body
          of the HTTP request. May only be given with compatible HTTP methods
          (PUT or POST).

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

API REFERENCE
    This command uses the cloudscheduler/v1 API. The full documentation for
    this API can be found at: https://cloud.google.com/scheduler/

EXAMPLES
    The following command creates a job that sends a request to the
    '/cron-handler' path in you App Engine app every 3 hours:

        $ gcloud beta scheduler jobs create app-engine my-job \
            --schedule="0 */3 * * *"
          --relative-url="/cron-handler"

NOTES
    This command is currently in BETA and may change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud scheduler jobs create app-engine
        $ gcloud alpha scheduler jobs create app-engine
