        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Update an existing device.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     DEVICE - The device to update. The arguments in this group can be used to
     specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not
     given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the
     [project] attribute: Set the property [core/project] or provide the flag
     [--project] on the command line. This must be specified.

       DEVICE
          The ID of the device or a fully qualified identifier for the device.
          This positional must be specified if any of the other arguments in
          this group are specified.

       --region=REGION
          The Cloud region for the device.

       --registry=REGISTRY
          The device registry for the device.

FLAGS
     --blocked
        If blocked, connections from this device will fail.

        Can be used to temporarily prevent the device from connecting if, for
        example, the sensor is generating bad data and needs maintenance.

        Use --no-blocked to enable connections and --blocked to disable.

     --metadata=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        The metadata key/value pairs assigned to devices. This metadata is not
        interpreted or indexed by Cloud IoT Core. It can be used to add
        contextual information for the device.

        Keys should only contain the following characters [a-zA-Z0-9-_] and be
        fewer than 128 bytes in length. Values are free-form strings. Each
        value must be fewer than or equal to 32 KB in size.

        The total size of all keys and values must be less than 256 KB, and the
        maximum number of key-value pairs is 500.

     --metadata-from-file=[KEY=PATH,...]
        Same as --metadata, but the metadata values will be read from the file
        specified by path.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
