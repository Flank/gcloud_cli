NAME
    gcloud beta emulators spanner start - start a local Cloud Spanner emulator

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta emulators spanner start [--host-port=HOST_PORT]
        [--rest-port=REST_PORT] [--use-docker=USE_DOCKER]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) This command starts a local Cloud Spanner emulator.

FLAGS
     --host-port=HOST_PORT
        The host:port to which the emulator should be bound. The default value
        is localhost:9010. Note that this port serves gRPC requests. To
        override the default port serving REST requests, use --rest-port. If
        using Docker to run the emulator, the host must be specified as an
        ipaddress.

     --rest-port=REST_PORT
        The port at which REST requests are served. gcloud uses REST to
        communicate with the emulator. The default value is 9020.

     --use-docker=USE_DOCKER
        Use the cloud spanner emulator docker image even if the platform has a
        native binary available in the sdk. Currently we only provide a native
        binary for Linux. For other systems, you must install docker for your
        platform before starting the emulator.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
