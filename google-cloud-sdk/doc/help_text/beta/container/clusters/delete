DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) When you delete a cluster, the following resources are deleted:

      o The master resources
      o All of the node instances in the cluster
      o Any Pods that are running on those instances
      o Any firewalls and routes created by Kubernetes Engine at the time of
        cluster creation
      o Data stored in host hostPath and emptyDir volumes

    The following resources are not deleted:

      o External load balancers created by the cluster
      o Persistent disk volumes

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME [NAME ...]
        The names of the clusters to delete.

FLAGS
     --async

          Compute region (e.g. us-central1) for the cluster.

       --zone=ZONE, -z ZONE
          Compute zone (e.g. us-central1-a) for the cluster. Overrides the
          default compute/zone property value for this command invocation.
