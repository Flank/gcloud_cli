      o All of the node instances in the cluster
      o Any Pods that are running on those instances
      o Any firewalls and routes created by Kubernetes Engine at the time of
        cluster creation
      o Data stored in host hostPath and emptyDir volumes

    The following resources are not deleted:

      o External load balancers created by the cluster
