DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) gcloud beta container node-pools update updates a node pool in a
    Google Kubernetes Engine cluster.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     NAME
        The name of the node pool.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --node-locations=ZONE,[ZONE,...]
          Set of zones in which the node pool's nodes should be located.
          Changing the locations for a node pool will result in nodes being
          either created or removed from the node pool, depending on whether
          locations are being added or removed.

          Multiple locations can be specified, separated by commas. For
          example:

              $ gcloud beta container node-pools update node-pool-1 \
                  --node-locations=us-central1-a,us-central1-b

       --workload-metadata-from-node=WORKLOAD_METADATA_FROM_NODE
          Type of metadata server available to pods running in the node pool.
          WORKLOAD_METADATA_FROM_NODE must be one of:

           EXPOSED
              Pods running in this node pool have access to the node's
              underlying Compute Engine Metadata Server.
           GKE_METADATA_SERVER
              Run the Kubernetes Engine Metadata Server on this node. The
              Kubernetes Engine Metadata Server exposes a metadata API to
              workloads that is compatible with the V1 Compute Metadata APIs
              exposed by the Compute Engine and App Engine Metadata Servers.
              This feature can only be enabled if Workload Identity is enabled
              at the cluster level.
           SECURE
              Prevents pods not in hostNetwork from accessing certain VM
              metadata, specifically kube-env, which contains Kubelet
              credentials, and the instance identity token. This is a temporary
              security solution available while the bootstrapping process for
              cluster nodes is being redesigned with significant security
              improvements. This feature is scheduled to be deprecated in the
              future and later removed.
           UNSPECIFIED
              Chooses the default.

       Cluster autoscaling

         --enable-autoprovisioning
            Enables Cluster Autoscaler to treat the node pool as if it was
            autoprovisioned.

            Cluster Autoscaler will be able to delete the node pool if it's
            unneeded.

         --enable-autoscaling
            Enables autoscaling for a node pool.

            Enables autoscaling in the node pool specified by --node-pool or
            the default node pool if --node-pool is not provided.

         --max-nodes=MAX_NODES
            Maximum number of nodes in the node pool.

            Maximum number of nodes to which the node pool specified by
            --node-pool (or default node pool if unspecified) can scale.
            Ignored unless --enable-autoscaling is also specified.

         --min-nodes=MIN_NODES
            Minimum number of nodes in the node pool.

            Minimum number of nodes to which the node pool specified by
            --node-pool (or default node pool if unspecified) can scale.
            Ignored unless --enable-autoscaling is also specified.

       Node management

         --enable-autorepair
            Enable node autorepair feature for a node pool.

                $ gcloud beta container node-pools update node-pool-1 \
                    --cluster=example-cluster --enable-autorepair

            See
            https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/node-auto-repair
            for more info.

         --enable-autoupgrade
            Sets autoupgrade feature for a node pool.

                $ gcloud beta container node-pools update node-pool-1 \
                    --cluster=example-cluster --enable-autoupgrade

            See
            https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/node-auto-upgrades
            for more info.

       Upgrade settings

         --max-surge-upgrade=MAX_SURGE_UPGRADE
            Number of extra (surge) nodes to be created on each upgrade of the
            node pool.

            Specifies the number of extra (surge) nodes to be created during
            this node pool's upgrades. For example, running the following
            command will result in creating an extra node each time the node
            pool is upgraded:

                $ gcloud beta container node-pools update node-pool-1 \
                    --cluster=example-cluster --max-surge-upgrade=1   \
                    --max-unavailable-upgrade=0

            Must be used in conjunction with '--max-unavailable-upgrade'.

         --max-unavailable-upgrade=MAX_UNAVAILABLE_UPGRADE
            Number of nodes that can be unavailable at the same time on each
            upgrade of the node pool.

            Specifies the number of nodes that can be unavailable at the same
            time during this node pool's upgrades. For example, assume the node
            pool has 5 nodes, running the following command will result in
            having 3 nodes being upgraded in parallel (1 + 2), but keeping
            always at least 3 (5 - 2) available each time the node pool is
            upgraded:

                $ gcloud beta container node-pools update node-pool-1 \
                    --cluster=example-cluster --max-surge-upgrade=1   \
                    --max-unavailable-upgrade=2

            Must be used in conjunction with '--max-surge-upgrade'.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --cluster=CLUSTER
        The name of the cluster. Overrides the default container/cluster
        property value for this command invocation.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --region=REGION
          Compute region (e.g. us-central1) for the cluster.

       --zone=ZONE, -z ZONE
          Compute zone (e.g. us-central1-a) for the cluster. Overrides the
          default compute/zone property value for this command invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,

NOTES
    This command is currently in BETA and may change without notice. These
