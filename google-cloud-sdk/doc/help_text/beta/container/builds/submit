NAME
    gcloud beta container builds submit - submit a build using the Google Cloud
        Build service

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta container builds submit [[SOURCE] --no-source]
        (--config=CONFIG | --tag=TAG, -t TAG) [--async] [--disk-size=DISK_SIZE]
        [--gcs-log-dir=GCS_LOG_DIR]
        [--gcs-source-staging-dir=GCS_SOURCE_STAGING_DIR]
        [--machine-type=MACHINE_TYPE] [--substitutions=[KEY=VALUE,...]]
        [--timeout=TIMEOUT] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) (DEPRECATED) Submit a build using the Google Cloud Build service.

    This command is deprecated and will be removed on or after 2018-10-31.
    Please use gcloud builds submit instead.

    Submit a build using the Google Cloud Build service.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     At most one of these may be specified:

       [SOURCE]
          The location of the source to build. The location can be a directory
          on a local disk or a gzipped archive file (.tar.gz) in Google Cloud
          Storage. If the source is a local directory, this command skips the
          files specified in the .gcloudignore file. If a .gitignore file is
          present in the local source directory, gcloud will use a
          Git-compatible .gcloudignore file that respects your .gitignored
          files. The global .gitignore is not respected. For more information
          on .gcloudignore, see $gcloud topic gcloudignore.

       --no-source
          Specify that no source should be uploaded with this build.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --config=CONFIG
          The .yaml or .json file to use for build configuration.

       --tag=TAG, -t TAG
          The tag to use with a "docker build" image creation. Cloud Build will
          run a remote "docker build -t $TAG .", where $TAG is the tag provided
          by this flag. The tag must be in the gcr.io/* or *.gcr.io/*
          namespaces. Specify a tag if you want Cloud Build to build using a
          Dockerfile instead of a build config file. If you specify a tag in
          this command, your source must include a Dockerfile. For instructions
          on building using a Dockerfile see
          https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/quickstart-docker.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Display information about the operation in progress, without waiting
        for the operation to complete.

     --disk-size=DISK_SIZE
        Machine disk size (GB) to run the build.

     --gcs-log-dir=GCS_LOG_DIR
        A directory in Google Cloud Storage to hold build logs. If this field
        is not set,
        gs://[PROJECT_NUMBER].cloudbuild-logs.googleusercontent.com/ will be
        created and used.

     --gcs-source-staging-dir=GCS_SOURCE_STAGING_DIR
        A directory in Google Cloud Storage to copy the source used for staging
        the build. If the specified bucket does not exist, Cloud Build will
        create one. If you don't set this field,
        gs://[PROJECT_ID]_cloudbuild/source is used.

     --machine-type=MACHINE_TYPE
        Machine type used to run the build. MACHINE_TYPE must be one of:
        n1-highcpu-32, n1-highcpu-8.

     --substitutions=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        Parameters to be substituted in the build specification.

        For example (using some nonsensical substitution keys; all keys must
        begin with an underscore):

            $ gcloud container builds submit . \
                --config config.yaml \
                --substitutions _FAVORITE_COLOR=blue,_NUM_CANDIES=10

        This will result in a build where every occurrence of
        ${_FAVORITE_COLOR} in certain fields is replaced by "blue", and
        similarly for ${_NUM_CANDIES} and "10".

        Only the following built-in variables can be specified with the
        --substitutions flag: REPO_NAME, BRANCH_NAME, TAG_NAME, REVISION_ID,
        COMMIT_SHA, SHORT_SHA.

        For more details, see:
        https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/api/build-requests#substitutions

     --timeout=TIMEOUT
        Maximum time a build is run before it is failed as TIMEOUT. It is
        specified as a duration; for example, "2h15m5s" is two hours, fifteen
        minutes, and five seconds. If you don't specify a unit, seconds is
        assumed. For example, "10" is 10 seconds. Overrides the default
        container/build_timeout property value for this command invocation.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.

NOTES
    You can also run a build locally using the separate component: gcloud
    components install cloud-build-local.

    This command is currently in BETA and may change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud container builds submit
        $ gcloud alpha container builds submit
