        Composer environment

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta composer environments create
        (ENVIRONMENT : --location=LOCATION) [--airflow-configs=[KEY=VALUE,...]]
        [--async] [--disk-size=DISK_SIZE; default="100GB"]
        [--env-variables=[NAME=VALUE,...]] [--labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]]
        [--machine-type=MACHINE_TYPE] [--node-count=NODE_COUNT]
        [--oauth-scopes=[SCOPE,...]] [--service-account=SERVICE_ACCOUNT]
        [--tags=[TAG,...]] [--zone=ZONE]
        [--network=NETWORK : --subnetwork=SUBNETWORK] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) If run asynchronously with --async, exits after printing an
    operation that can be used to poll the status of the creation operation
    via:

        gcloud composer operations describe

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Environment resource - The environment to create. The arguments in this
     group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some
     attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other
     ways. To set the [project] attribute: provide the flag [environment] on
     the command line with a fully specified name; provide the flag [--project]
     on the command line; set the property [core/project]. This must be
     specified.

       ENVIRONMENT
          The ID of the environment or a fully qualified identifier for the
          environment. This positional must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          Compute Engine region in which to create the environment.

FLAGS
     --airflow-configs=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        A list of Airflow software configuration override KEY=VALUE pairs to
        set. For information on how to structure KEYs and VALUEs, run $ gcloud
        help composer environments update.

     --async
        Display information about the operation in progress, without waiting
        for the operation to complete.

     --disk-size=DISK_SIZE; default="100GB"
        The disk size for each VM node in the environment. The minimum size is
        20GB, and the maximum is 64TB. Specified value must be an integer
        multiple of gigabytes. Cannot be updated after the environment has been
        created. If units are not provided, defaults to GB.

     --env-variables=[NAME=VALUE,...]
        A comma-delimited list of environment variable NAME=VALUE pairs to
        provide to the Airflow scheduler, worker, and webserver processes. NAME
        may contain upper and lowercase letters, digits, and underscores, but
        they may not begin with a digit. To include commas as part of a VALUE,
        see gcloud topics escaping for information about overriding the
        delimiter.

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     --machine-type=MACHINE_TYPE
        The Compute Engine machine type
        (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types) to use for nodes.
        For example --machine-type=n1-standard-1.

     --node-count=NODE_COUNT
        The number of nodes to create to run the environment.

     --oauth-scopes=[SCOPE,...]
        The set of Google API scopes to be made available on all of the node
        VMs. Defaults to ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform'].
        Cannot be updated.

     --service-account=SERVICE_ACCOUNT
        The Google Cloud Platform service account to be used by the node VMs.
        If a service account is not specified, the "default" Compute Engine
        service account for the project is used. Cannot be updated.

     --tags=[TAG,...]
        The set of instance tags applied to all node VMs. Tags are used to
        identify valid sources or targets for network firewalls. Each tag
        within the list must comply with RFC 1035. Cannot be updated.

     --zone=ZONE
        The Compute Engine zone in which the environment will be created. For
        example --zone=us-central1-a.

     Virtual Private Cloud networking

       --network=NETWORK
          The Compute Engine Network to which the environment will be
          connected. If a 'Custom Subnet Network' is provided, --subnetwork
          must be specified as well. This flag must be specified if any of the
          other arguments in this group are specified.

       --subnetwork=SUBNETWORK
          The Compute Engine subnetwork
          (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/subnetworks) to which the
          environment will be connected.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.
