    operation that can be used to poll the status of the creation operation
    via:

        gcloud composer operations describe

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Environment resource - The environment to create. The arguments in this
     group can be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some
     attributes are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other
     ways. To set the [project] attribute: provide the argument [environment]
     on the command line with a fully specified name; provide the argument
     [--project] on the command line; set the property [core/project]. This
     must be specified.

       ENVIRONMENT
          ID of the environment or fully qualified identifier for the
          environment. This positional must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          Compute Engine region in which to create the environment.

FLAGS
     --airflow-configs=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        A list of Airflow software configuration override KEY=VALUE pairs to
        set. For information on how to structure KEYs and VALUEs, run $ gcloud
        help composer environments update.

     --async
        Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to
        complete.

     --disk-size=DISK_SIZE; default="100GB"
        The disk size for each VM node in the environment. The minimum size is
        20GB, and the maximum is 64TB. Specified value must be an integer
        multiple of gigabytes. Cannot be updated after the environment has been
        created. If units are not provided, defaults to GB.

     --env-variables=[NAME=VALUE,...]
        A comma-delimited list of environment variable NAME=VALUE pairs to
        provide to the Airflow scheduler, worker, and webserver processes. NAME
        may contain upper and lowercase letters, digits, and underscores, but
        they may not begin with a digit. To include commas as part of a VALUE,
        see gcloud topics escaping for information about overriding the
        delimiter.

     --labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.

        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens
        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must
        contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and
        numbers.

     --machine-type=MACHINE_TYPE
        The Compute Engine machine type
        (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types) to use for nodes.
        For example --machine-type=n1-standard-1.

     --node-count=NODE_COUNT
        The number of nodes to create to run the environment.

     --oauth-scopes=[SCOPE,...]
        The set of Google API scopes to be made available on all of the node
        VMs. Defaults to ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform'].
        Cannot be updated.

     --python-version=PYTHON_VERSION
        The Python version to be used within the created environment. Supplied
        value should represent the desired major Python version. Cannot be
        updated. PYTHON_VERSION must be one of:

         2
            Created environment will use Python 2
         3
            Created environment will use Python 3

     --service-account=SERVICE_ACCOUNT
        The Google Cloud Platform service account to be used by the node VMs.
        If a service account is not specified, the "default" Compute Engine
        service account for the project is used. Cannot be updated.

     --tags=[TAG,...]
        The set of instance tags applied to all node VMs. Tags are used to
        identify valid sources or targets for network firewalls. Each tag
        within the list must comply with RFC 1035. Cannot be updated.

     --zone=ZONE
        The Compute Engine zone in which the environment will be created. For
        example --zone=us-central1-a.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --airflow-version=AIRFLOW_VERSION
          Version of Airflow to run in the environment.

              Must be of the form `X.Y[.Z]`.

              The latest supported Cloud Composer version will be used within
              the created environment.

       --image-version=IMAGE_VERSION
          Version of the image to run in the environment.

              The image version encapsulates the versions of both Cloud Composer
              and Apache Airflow. Must be of the form `composer-A.B.C-airflow-X.Y[.Z]`.

              The Cloud Composer and Airflow versions are semantic versions.
              `latest` can be provided instead of an explicit Cloud Composer
              version number indicating that the server will replace `latest`
              with the current Cloud Composer version. For the Apache Airflow
              portion, the patch version can be omitted and the current
              version will be selected. The version numbers that are used will
              be stored.

     IP Alias (VPC-native)

       --cluster-ipv4-cidr=CLUSTER_IPV4_CIDR
          IP address range for the pods in this cluster in CIDR notation (e.g.
          10.0.0.0/14).

          Cannot be specified unless '--enable-ip-alias' is also specified.

       --cluster-secondary-range-name=CLUSTER_SECONDARY_RANGE_NAME
          Secondary range to be used as the source for pod IPs. Alias ranges
          will be allocated from this secondary range. NAME must be the name of
          an existing secondary range in the cluster subnetwork.

          Cannot be specified unless '--enable-ip-alias' is also specified.

       --enable-ip-alias
          Enable use of alias IPs
          (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/alias-ip/) for Pod IPs. This
          will require at least two secondary ranges in the subnetwork, one for
          the pod IPs and another to reserve space for the services range.

       --services-ipv4-cidr=SERVICES_IPV4_CIDR
          IP range for the services IPs.

          Can be specified as a netmask size (e.g. '/20') or as in CIDR notion
          (e.g. '10.100.0.0/20'). If given as a netmask size, the IP range will
          be chosen automatically from the available space in the network.

          If unspecified, the services CIDR range will be chosen with a default
          mask size.

          Cannot be specified unless '--enable-ip-alias' is also specified.

       --services-secondary-range-name=SERVICES_SECONDARY_RANGE_NAME
          Secondary range to be used for services (e.g. ClusterIPs). NAME must
          be the name of an existing secondary range in the cluster subnetwork.

          Cannot be specified unless '--enable-ip-alias' is also specified.

     Private Clusters

       --enable-private-endpoint
          Environment cluster is managed using the private IP address of the
          master API endpoint. Therefore access to the master endpoint must be
          from internal IP addresses.

          If not specified, the master API endpoint will be accessible by its
          public IP address.

          Cannot be specified unless '--enable-private-environnment' is also
          specified.

       --enable-private-environment
          Environment cluster is created with no public IP addresses on the
          cluster nodes.

          If not specified, cluster nodes will be assigned public IP addresses.

          Cannot be specified unless '--enable-ip-alias' is also specified.

       --master-ipv4-cidr=MASTER_IPV4_CIDR
          IPv4 CIDR range to use for the master network. This should have a
          netmask of size /28.

          Cannot be specified unless '--enable-private-environnment' is also
          specified.

     Virtual Private Cloud networking

       --network=NETWORK
          The Compute Engine Network to which the environment will be
          connected. If a 'Custom Subnet Network' is provided, --subnetwork
          must be specified as well. This flag must be specified if any of the
          other arguments in this group are specified.

       --subnetwork=SUBNETWORK
          The Compute Engine subnetwork
          (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/subnetworks) to which the
          environment will be connected.

     At most one of these may be specified:

       --web-server-allow-ip=[description=DESCRIPTION],[ip_range=IP_RANGE]
          Specifies a list of IPv4 or IPv6 ranges that will be allowed to
          access the Airflow web server. By default, all IPs are allowed to
          access the web server.

       ip_range
          IPv4 or IPv6 range of addresses allowed to access the Airflow web
          server.

       description
          An optional description of the IP range.
       --web-server-deny-all
          Denies all incoming traffic to the Airflow web server.

        $ gcloud beta composer environments create env-1 \
            --machine-type=n1-standard-8 --network=my-network
