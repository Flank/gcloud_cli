DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Updates properties of an environment.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     ENVIRONMENT - The environment to update. The arguments in this group can
     be used to specify the attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes
     are not given arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set
     the [project] attribute: Set the property [core/project] or provide the
     flag [--project] on the command line. This must be specified.

       ENVIRONMENT
          The ID of the environment or a fully qualified identifier for the
          environment. This positional must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The Cloud location for the environment.

REQUIRED FLAGS
     The update type. Exactly one of these must be specified:

       --node-count=NODE_COUNT
          The new number of nodes running the Environment. Must be >= 3.

       --update-airflow-configs=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          A list of Airflow config override KEY=VALUE pairs to set. If a config
          override already exists, its value is updated; otherwise a new config
          override is created.

          KEYs should specify the configuration section and property name,
          separated by a hyphen, for example core-print_stats_interval. The
          section may not contain a closing square brace or period. The
          property name must be non-empty and may not contain an equals sign,
          semicolon, or period. By convention, property names are spelled with
          snake_case. VALUEs may contain any character.

       At most one of these may be specified:

         --clear-airflow-configs
            Remove all Airflow config overrides from the environment.

         --remove-airflow-configs=[KEY,...]
            A list of Airflow config override keys to remove.

       --update-env-variables=[NAME=VALUE,...]
          A list of environment variable NAME=VALUE pairs to set and provide to
          the Aiflow scheduler, worker, and webserver processes. If an
          environmeent variable already exists, its value is updated; otherwise
          a new environment variable is created.

          NAMEs are the environment variable names and may contain upper and
          lowercase letters, digits, and underscores; they must not begin with
          a digit.

          User-specified environment variables should not be used to set
          Airflow configuration properties. Instead use the
          --update-airflow-configs flag.

       At most one of these may be specified:

         --clear-env-variables
            Remove all environment variables from the environment.

            Environment variables that have system-provided defaults cannot be
            unset with the --remove-env-variables or --clear-env-variables
            flags; only the user-supplied overrides will be removed.

         --remove-env-variables=[NAME,...]
            A list of environment variables to remove.

            Environment variables that have system-provided defaults cannot be
            unset with the --remove-env-variables or --clear-env-variables
            flags; only the user-supplied overrides will be removed.

       --update-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]
          A list of label KEY=VALUE pairs to update. If a label exists its
          value is modified, otherwise a new label is created.

       At most one of these may be specified:

         --clear-labels
            Removes all labels. If --update-labels is also specified then
            --clear-labels is applied first.

            For example, to remove all labels:

                $ gcloud beta composer environments update --clear-labels

            To set the labels to exactly "foo" and "baz":

                $ gcloud beta composer environments update --clear-labels \
                  --update-labels foo=bar,baz=qux

         --remove-labels=[KEY,...]
            A list of label keys to remove. If a label does not exist it is
            silently ignored.

       At most one of these may be specified:

         --update-pypi-packages-from-file=UPDATE_PYPI_PACKAGES_FROM_FILE
            The path to a file containing a list of PyPI packages to install in
            the environment. Each line in the file should contain a package
            specification in the format of the update-pypi-package argument
            defined above.

         --update-pypi-package=PACKAGE[EXTRAS_LIST]VERSION_SPECIFIER
            A PyPI package add to the environment. If a package already exists,
            its value is updated; otherwise a new package is installed.

            The value takes the form of: PACKAGE[EXTRAS_LIST]VERSION_SPECIFIER,
            as one would specify in a pip requirements file.

            PACKAGE is specified as a package name such as numpy. EXTRAS_LIST
            is a comma-delimited list of PEP 508 distribution extras that may
            be empty, in which case the enclosing square brackets may be
            omitted. VERSION_SPECIFIER is an optional PEP 440 version
            specifier. If both EXTRAS_LIST and VERSION_SPECIFIER are omitted,
            the = and everything to the right may be left empty.

            This is a repeated argument that can be specified multiple times to
            update multiple packages. If PACKAGE appears more than once, the
            last value will be used.

         At most one of these may be specified:

           --clear-pypi-packages
              Remove all PyPI packages from the environment.

              PyPI packages that are required by the environment's core
              software cannot be uninstalled with the --remove-pypi-packages or
              --clear-pypi-packages flags.

           --remove-pypi-packages=[PACKAGE,...]
              A list of PyPI package names to remove.

              PyPI packages that are required by the environment's core
              software cannot be uninstalled with the --remove-pypi-packages or
              --clear-pypi-packages flags.

OPTIONAL FLAGS
     --async
        Display information about the operation in progress, without waiting
        for the operation to complete.

    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.
