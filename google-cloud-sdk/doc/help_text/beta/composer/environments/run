NAME
    gcloud beta composer environments run - run an Airflow sub-command remotely
        in a Cloud Composer environment

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta composer environments run (ENVIRONMENT : --location=LOCATION)
        SUBCOMMAND [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...] [-- CMD_ARGS ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Executes an Airflow CLI sub-command remotely in an environment. If
    the sub-command takes flags, separate the environment name from the
    sub-command and its flags with ``--''. This command waits for the
    sub-command to complete; its exit code will match the sub-command's exit
    code.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     Environment resource - The environment in which to run an Airflow command.
     The arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this
     resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given arguments in this group but
     can be set in other ways. To set the [project] attribute: provide the
     argument [environment] on the command line with a fully specified name;
     provide the argument [--project] on the command line; set the property
     [core/project]. This must be specified.

       ENVIRONMENT
          ID of the environment or fully qualified identifier for the
          environment. This positional must be specified if any of the other
          arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          Compute Engine region in which to create the environment.

     SUBCOMMAND
        The Airflow CLI subcommand to run. Available subcommands include:
        backfill, clear, connections, dag_state, delete_dag, kerberos,
        list_dag_runs, list_dags, list_tasks, next_execution, pause, pool,
        render, run, task_failed_deps, task_state, test, trigger_dag, unpause,
        variables, version (see https://airflow.apache.org/cli.html for more
        info). Note that delete_dag is available from Airflow 1.10.1, and
        list_dag_runs, next_execution are available from Airflow 1.10.2.

     [-- CMD_ARGS ...]
        Command line arguments to the subcommand.

        The '--' argument must be specified between gcloud specific args on the
        left and CMD_ARGS on the right. Example:

        gcloud beta composer environments run myenv trigger_dag -- some_dag
        --run_id=foo

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

EXAMPLES
    The following command:

        gcloud beta composer environments run myenv trigger_dag -- some_dag --run_id=foo

    is equivalent to running the following command from a shell inside the
    my-environment environment:

        airflow trigger_dag some_dag --run_id=foo

NOTES
    This command is currently in BETA and may change without notice. These
    variants are also available:

        $ gcloud composer environments run
        $ gcloud alpha composer environments run
