NAME
    gcloud beta privateca subordinates delete - schedule a subordinate
        certificate authority for deletion

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud beta privateca subordinates delete
        (CERTIFICATE_AUTHORITY : --location=LOCATION) [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    (BETA) Schedule a subordinate certificate authority for deletion in 30
    days.

    Note that any user-managed KMS keys or Google Cloud Storage buckets will
    not be affected by this operation. You will need to delete the user-
    managed resources separately once the CA is deleted. Any Google-managed
    resources will be cleaned up.

    The CA specified in this command MUST:

        1) be disabled.
        2) have no un-revoked or un-expired certificates. Use the revoke command
           to revoke any active certificates.

    You can use the restore command to halt this process.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY resource - The certificate authority to schedule
     deletion for. The arguments in this group can be used to specify the
     attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given
     arguments in this group but can be set in other ways. To set the [project]
     attribute: provide the argument [CERTIFICATE_AUTHORITY] on the command
     line with a fully specified name; provide the argument [--project] on the
     command line; set the property [core/project]. This must be specified.

       CERTIFICATE_AUTHORITY
          ID of the CERTIFICATE_AUTHORITY or fully qualified identifier for the
          CERTIFICATE_AUTHORITY. This positional must be specified if any of
          the other arguments in this group are specified.

       --location=LOCATION
          The location of the CERTIFICATE_AUTHORITY. Alternatively, you can set
          the property [privateca/location].
