NAME
    gcloud components reinstall - reinstall the Cloud SDK with the same
        components you have now

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud components reinstall [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

    fix it by downloading the latest version of the Cloud SDK and reinstalling
    it. This will replace your existing installation with a fresh one. The
    command is the equivalent of deleting your current installation,
    downloading a fresh copy of the SDK, and installing in the same location.

    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run $ gcloud help for details.
