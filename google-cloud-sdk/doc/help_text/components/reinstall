NAME
    gcloud components reinstall - reinstall the Cloud SDK with the same
        components you have now

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud components reinstall [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    If your Cloud SDK installation becomes corrupt, this command attempts to
    fix it by downloading the latest version of the Cloud SDK and reinstalling
    it. This will replace your existing installation with a fresh one. The
    command is the equivalent of deleting your current installation,
    downloading a fresh copy of the SDK, and installing in the same location.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,
    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.
