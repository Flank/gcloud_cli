NAME
    gcloud components install - install one or more Cloud SDK components

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud components install COMPONENT-IDS [COMPONENT-IDS ...]
        [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Ensure that each of the specified components (as well as any dependent
    components) is installed on the local workstation. Components are installed
    without performing any upgrades to your existing SDK installation. All
    components are installed at the current version of your SDK.

    Components that are available for installation can be viewed by running:

        $ gcloud components list

    Installing a given component will also install all components on which it
    depends. The command lists all components it is about to install, and asks
    for confirmation before proceeding.

    gcloud components install installs components from the version of the Cloud
    SDK you currently have installed. You can see your current version by
    running:

        $ gcloud version

    If you want to update your Cloud SDK installation to the latest available
    version, use:

        $ gcloud components update

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
     COMPONENT-IDS [COMPONENT-IDS ...]
        The IDs of the components to be installed.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

EXAMPLES
    The following command installs COMPONENT-1, COMPONENT-2, and all components
    that they depend on:

        $ gcloud components install COMPONENT-1 COMPONENT-2
