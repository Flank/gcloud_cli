NAME
    gcloud components update - update all of your installed components to the
        latest version

SYNOPSIS
    gcloud components update [--version=VERSION] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Ensure that the latest version of all installed components is installed on
    the local workstation.

    The command lists all components it is about to update, and asks for
    confirmation before proceeding.

    By default, this command will update all components to their latest
    version. This can be configured by using the --version flag to choose a
    specific version to update to. This version may also be a version older
    than the one that is currently installed.

    You can see your current Cloud SDK version by running:

        $ gcloud version

    To see the latest version of the Cloud SDK, run:

        $ gcloud components list

    If you run this command without the --version flag and you already have the
    latest version installed, no update will be performed.

FLAGS
     --version=VERSION
        An optional Cloud SDK version to update your components to. By default,
        components are updated to the latest available version.

GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,
    --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for
    details.

EXAMPLES

        $ gcloud components update
